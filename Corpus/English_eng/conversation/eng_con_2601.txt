&-um the class today is &-um recorded for &-um a database for the Program in Linguistics is that +/. 8855_18655
mhm +/.
+, &-um a database of &-um academic discourse . 19295_21795
&-um so &-um this is completely independent from the course and it should in no way inhibit your participation . 22775_29495
just ignore it basically . 30395_31535
&-um what I wanna do today with you is use &-um Roth's novel The Ghost Writer to &-um to discuss two issues that have to do with collective memory after the Holocaust . 32535_51795
&-um the first question hasta do with the centrality of the Holocaust for &-um Jewish collective memory and and Jewish collective identity . 52895_65775
and &-um the second question which we'll examine <in the> in the second hour &-um asks &-um what are the implications of remembering the Holocaust through a symbol like Anne Frank . 67175_79995
and &-um I want to start with &-um with the essay that I recommended you read that I included in in the course pack and and &-uh which you can refer to after the class if you &-um if your interest has been &-um peaked . 81975_101835
&-um the essay from the the &-uh the book The Imaginary Jew in which he examines his the development of his own Jewish identity it's a it's an essay that &-um I find particularly resonates with my my own experience and I I find it &-um really &-um thoughtful <and &-um> and &-um and thought provoking . 103055_133035
I I must say that <I share himself> &~w I share myself &-um his own development from a &-um an unexamined &-uh pride of &-um <of being> &-um of descending from xxx one from a family that was affected by the Holocaust to a more reflexive stance and and &-um a more self-conscious stance on on &-uh the place of the Holocaust in my own identity . 138915_168415
and that's one of the reasons why &-um I told you that it was with mixed feelings <that I> that I had &-um revealed to you where where I come from . 168455_178815
but &-um Alain Finkielkraut he's a French philosopher writes about this &-um this identity . 179575_189255
and &-uh I just wanna quote to you from page seven <in the> in the essay . 190035_194775
&-um he's talking about this this &-um new Jewish identity that's &-uh that's a privileged identity a privileged identity as as a victim . 196345_206285
&-um and he says &{l=READING I inherited a suffering to which I had not been subjected . 206445_211845
for without having to endure oppression the identity of the victim was mine . 212905_216685
I could savor an exceptional destiny while remaining completely at ease . 217345_222125
without exposure to real danger I had heroic stature . 222475_225895
to be Jewish was enough to escape the anonymity of an identity indistinguishable from others and the dullness of an &~unevent uneventful life . 226895_236535
&}l=READING and I think he's &-um the observation is &-um is is &-uh accurate &-um I think it's it's &-um not unusual for &-um Jews who were affected more or less directly or even not at all directly for &-um taking on this &-um this identity of &-um &~c coming after the Holocaust and somehow <this is> &-uh this is a privileged &-um identity of of &-um of a victim . 237545_267525
and &-um this imaginary Jew that Finkielkraut is &-um the &~off offspring of survivors who &-um confers himself this undeserved &-um moral superiority . 279025_297805
&-um and his criticism &-um also &-um targets the the fact that &-um those who who do take on this undeserved identity &-um do so without knowing much of &-uh Jewish history or or Judaism and &-um and this &~iden this romantic identity <is &-uh> is &-uh is sort_of ideal &-um ideal identity as a sufferer . 298825_328805
&-um but it's it's a pose <more than> more than in reality . 335105_338985
&-um and let me quote another &-um another passage that's telling on page eleven (0.6) he &~i he talks about this &-um this status that &-um that is conferred to him simply by by mentioning the fact that he had &-um that he has personal connections to the Holocaust he says &{l=READING I too will recount stories of the final solution . 341265_371245
and my interlocutors seized by a mixture of stupefaction shame and respect would see in me something other than myself the faces of those tortured to death . 376905_387085
so this is &-um the +... 387685_395025
the concept of the the imaginary Jew that &-um that Finkielkraut discusses and it's it &-um raises the question of how how central the Holocaust should be for <for today's> &-um for today's Jews and for defining Jewish identity and &-um for Jewish collective memory . 398465_420385
&-um the Holocaust tends to be &~n nowadays a <a central> &-um a central tenant of &-um Jewish &~i identity especially in for American Jews for Western European Jews &-um and I want to focus on the American Jewish experience &-um because this is what Roth focuses on and &-um it's it's been much discussed . 422185_452165
&-um the fact that the the Holocaust has often become the centerpiece of &-um the American Jewish experience . 457185_466325
&-um many American Jews go on pilgrimages to to Auschwitz for example . 467285_474045
and &-um while the Holocaust has remained &-um &~f fairly &-um tangential to to &-uh the experience of the general population &-um while it's only a marginal event for the rest of the population for American Jews it tends to &-um to be used as a confirmation of &-um Jewish uniqueness . 474865_502005
and &-um I think it's particularly &-um acute in in this society because of &-um the emphasis placed on multiculturalism . 503505_515485
and with multiculturalism &-um ethnic groups tend to to be conferred a special status &-um through suffering +... 516285_526145
it &~ten tends to be tends to be the case . 529185_531405
&-um (0.5) I just wanted to give you &-um an example . 533505_542825
when I was &-um a graduate student in Madison Wisconsin the public schools organized a multicultural fest and &-um each ethnic group in the schools had their little booth and &-um I don't know pizza was served in the Italian booth or you can just imagine . 543305_559845
and then the Jewish booth was was centered around the Holocaust and &-um it's it's problematic to &-um to represent Jewish identity through an event that &-um that is primarily an event of &-um of destruction and and of suffering it's it's not a positive event . 560345_584745
it's not &-um +... 584945_586285
&~i it's &-um it's not the the rich culture that &-um that came before the Holocaust and that that even continues &-um today and &-uh this this use of &-um of the Holocaust as a central tenant of &-um of today's Jewishness has been criticized <I'm not> &-um I'm not making it up it's &-um it's been criticized &-um by Jewish historians by by Jewish cultural critics &-um because it's seen to be detrimental to to &-um Jewish &~t to furthering the knowledge of &-um of Jewish culture of Jewish history . 590075_620055
&-um the the writer Phillip Lopate whose article I had included at the beginning of the course pack &-um expresses his discomfort with what he calls this extermination pride . 637585_651685
&-um and he he &-um says that the Holocaust becomes another opportunity for Jewish &~s chauvinism . 652585_662345
(0.4) and &-um others have have &-um criticized this this phenomenon &-um that the the Holocaust replaces as a text almost replaces the the Bible . 667145_682665
it it becomes the the central text &-um for Judaism . 683665_689965
and &-uh even Speigleman in an interview said &{l=READING although I find myself probably connected to my Jewishness primarily through the Holocaust I am concerned about the idea that someday Christians will walk around with crucifixes and Jews will walk around with little gas chambers around their necks . 690985_708985
&}l=READING &-um scathing critique . 709125_715365
but &-uh it's a it's it's satirical but it it's it rings true to a certain extent . 716745_723045
&-um a religious scholar Jacob Neusner +... 724805_727525
has &-um &=writing:board two central myths that are related . 736145_749205
the theme of &-um destruction and the theme of rebirth . 749805_753185
and these two themes are embodied in the Holocaust and then the creation of the the state of Israel . 754765_760525
&-um and he argues that Jews have now substituted &-um Auschwitz for Mount Sinai . 761305_773785
that the the central the pivotal historical event of Jewish experience is no longer the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai but it is the destruction of European Jewry in Auschwitz . 774755_790415
and he actually backs backs this up . 790795_793195
this is not just a theory . 793295_794335
&-um he cites a nineteen eighty eight survey that revealed five times as &~m as many American Jews believed that the Holocaust and Israel were more important to them as Jews than &-um the Exodus and the the receiving of the Torah at Mount Sinai . 794945_813365
(0.4) so he talks about this Judaism of destruction and redemption as a new Jewish civil religion . 817345_825005
and he talks of it critically of_course . 826565_828985
&-um so it's deplored by by religious scholars it's deplored by Jewish historians and I gave you &-um &~a again as recommended an article by the Jewish historian Paula Hyman who &-um criticizes this this focus on the Holocaust to the exclusion of other aspects of &-um Jewish history . 830945_856245
and she she talks of this &-um this focus as the lachrymose theory of Jewish history . 856385_863485
lachrymose meaning it's the basis for crying for for lamentation . 863865_871025
and &-um <she would> she would rather &-um emphasize the positive sides of &-uh Jewish culture and Jewish history . 872445_882485
&-um &~sh she would want to &-um to retain a more affirmative image <of a> of a tradition that that values life and that was not wallowing in death . 883465_897065
it's this attitude has also been &-um criticized for &-um for political reasons because &-uh some people argue that &-um today's Jews use the Holocaust as a political weapon that and and this is what I refer to as the instrumentalization of the Holocaust . 909795_934835
that it is used to &-um to garner sympathy for Jewish causes . 935315_944215
either within Jewish communities for fund+raising purposes or &-um on the international scene &-um for &-um &-um securing support for for them for Israel or other &-uh Jewish political causes . 944225_966725
(0.6) &-um this this focus on on on the Holocaust and the this &-um the centrality of the Holocaust has not been seen as negative by by all people . 974345_987425
some &-um some scholars have &-um have seen it as &-uh as only one stage in &-um in the learning process about about Judaism about Jewish history Jewish culture and &-um some some argue that &-um people who come to learn more about &-um Jewish culture through the Holocaust will eventually &-um learn &-um &~a and discover more &-um about the other aspects of of &-uh Jewish history and culture so it's a full it's a it's like a gateway into &-uh more knowledge . 988745_1018725
so just &-um there's not a consensus on this &-um question . 1036185_1042545
but &-um I I gave this to you as a as an introduction to &-um to our discussion of &-um Roth's novel because Roth is is struggling with with this question of what is the place of the Holocaust for for &-um the identity of of an American Jewish writer in this case &-um his protagonist . 1044105_1068905
&-um Roth was &-um was born an American Jew he was born in Newark in thirty three . 1071425_1080045
and &-um you probably know that he's most famous <for his> for his novel Portnoy's Complaint that was published in in sixty nine . 1080485_1089365
&-um that was a controversial &-um novel and &-um at at the time he encountered &-um critical reactions of the fact that Nathan Zuckerman in the novel he was encountering he was accused of &-um portraying his Jewish characters in a negative light and contributing to or fueling antisemitism . 1090105_1118065
(0.4) &-um (0.6) &~he throughout his &-um his writing career his he's been coming back to the theme of the Holocaust . 1122105_1137605
and &-um he he refutes the accusation that he's been exploiting the Holocaust . 1138445_1146025
&-um he says &{l=READING for most reflective American Jews the Holocaust is simply there hidden submerged emerging disappearing and forgotten . 1147505_1157265
you don't make use of it it makes use of you . 1157865_1161285
&}l=READING &-um and this is probably what he's trying to to examine through through &-um the the adventure of the &-um of his character of his alter ego Nathan Zuckerman . 1162325_1175845
(0.6) so the the novel takes place in nineteen fifty six which is &-uh a year after the &-um dramatization of The Diary of Anne Frank was produced on Broadway and &-um the the protagonist Nathan Zuckerman is &-uh spending &-um the night at &-uh at the house of his his &-um mentor . 1181945_1211925
and encounters a a mysterious woman that he he mentions &-um is Anne Frank <who survived the camps> and &-uh it leads <to &-um> to &-um &~s self-exploration the the reason why he's &-um &~por projecting &-um his this fantasy of Anne Frank onto this woman is because he was accused &-um by &-um by a friend of his father Judge Wapter of &-uh writing of contributing to antisemitism through his &-um short stories and &-uh Judge Wapter urges him to to go see the the play The Diary of Anne Frank . 1213225_1243205
and Nathan &-um fantasizes bringing this woman home as as his bride . 1271825_1279865
&-um so Roth struggles with this this tendency &-um of today's Jews to to &-um use the Holocaust <as a> as a defining &-uh moment in &-uh in in the history the identity . 1283225_1303765
and this conflict is embodied <in the> in the conflict between &-uh Judge Wapter and Nathan +... 1304505_1311425
&-um how how do these two how do these two characters &-um relate to the Holocaust ? 1312485_1323945
and and <what is> what is Roth trying to to suggest with this &-um this conflict between Judge Wapter who accuses &-uh Nathan of basically being a Nazi and &-uh and Nathan who's simply writing short stories about about his family and the eccentric characters in his family . 1326225_1356205
<what is> what is Roth suggesting here ? 1378735_1390595
<with his> with his plot ?
(0.11) .
well that that the Holocaust is seen as a reason for self-censorship or something it's &-uh yeah to be prevented so &~y you have to look at everything as you know whether or not it's it's good for the Jews or not . 1379265_1393185
you know what kind of position it will place them in I think I mean this is supposed to take place in nineteen fifty six something +/. 1393885_1400805
okay +/.
+, I don't think I mean I think that's a pretty &-um I don't think a_lot_of people really view it that way anymore but I think maybe at that time some were . 1400605_1409585
that they don't view it which way ? 1410265_1412885
well I_mean the people don't +//. 1412945_1414185
&-uh you_know like at &~t at the time it seems like the Holocaust was mostly really only thought of among <in the> within the Jewish community and it really wasn't something that was you_know discussed outside of the Jewish community . 1415805_1427965
it was more internalized and &-uh it was more <of a> of a &~w something that Jews felt &-um that they hadta prevent from happening by you_know conforming to you_know what any kind of expectations they thought <that there> that there should be for them . 1428105_1446565
but I think that since then I mean I think it's &-um you know left this real kind of parochial kinda +/. 1447345_1454225
mhm +/.
+, confine .
(0.4) .
but &~yo you're right <I think> I think you're right that &-um that it's changed somewhat although I I &~th I do think that the &~reas &-um like Roth is coming to this is reviving this &-um this issue because it's not completely it's not completely &-um &~an &~an something of the past . 1462365_1486465
and I think that &-um it's still the Holocaust <is still> is still used to to censor &-um people to to give &-um it is used <for &-um> for &-um providing oneself that the &-um &~self self-righteousness for for &-um giving oneself moral superiority . 1486945_1513605
&~exce except it doesn't seem like the instrumentalization is necessarily for some kind_of like outside pity or sympathy it's more an internal form of just kind_of censorship or . 1514425_1524385
mhm it's in general that the the judge is also concerned about the image that this writer is projecting +/. 1524665_1531005
right +/.
+, of the Jews &~o on the outside of the Jewish community . 1531265_1536625
so &-um +... 1537105_1539005
&~a and &-um and I think that it's still relevant . 1543265_1546485
even if it's even if it's expressed in in different &-uh experience . 1548685_1554085
it's still relevant (0.4) <how does> how does Nathan &-um react to this this form of censorship ? 1554305_1564125
<what is> what is he arguing +..? 1565265_1568405
<is he> is he completely ignoring the the the fact that the the Holocaust &-um is &-um should influence what what he is writing ? 1573305_1588125
what is +...
what is he what is he feel ? 1588425_1595525
yeah Deborah ?
I think he's arguing for more of an artistic truth that says &-um this is the effect it had on my family . 1595745_1601925
and +/.
mhm +/.
+, these are who these people are now and so I need to talk about that . 1602685_1606345
mhm +...
&-um he's he does argue for artistic license he also argues that &-um that the Holocaust <is not> is not always relevant to to what's happening in the American Jewish community that it doesn't always have <to be> to be brought up and and there's a there's that &-um comic passage on on page one oh six in which he's arguing with his mother <over this> over this letter that Judge Wapter sent him . 1609865_1639845
&-um would someone who has the book please read the the &~pa the dialogue +..? 1646505_1651945

go to the office of the plastic surgeon where girls get their noses fixed . 1730285_1733525
that's where the Jewish blood flows in Essex county and <that's where> &-um that's where the blow is delivered with a mallet to their bones and to their pride . 1734065_1745445
&}l=READING ⌈ pleasing ⌉ .
⌊ that's enough ⌋ I think we can stop here . 1746225_1748045
<what is he> what is he arguing here ? 1749045_1750745
what is Nathan saying here ? 1750965_1751705
(0.10) Susan ?
he's saying that they're different than the Jews <at Belsen> . 1761705_1764585
and that &-um I I think he's &~sa I see I don't think he &-um the writer Nathan I don't think that he thinks about the Holocaust at all to me it doesn't seem like he does . 1765765_1778185
and he thinks that well maybe a little bit but that he doesn't mean it comes into play with what he writes and his views . 1778745_1786005
so I think he's completely separating these people from the people over there . 1786705_1791945
⌈ but I don't know ⌉ .
⌊ he ⌋ he does insist on on the fact that they have completely different lives . 1792745_1798725
and &-uh and that there are other &-um subjects worthy of writing besides &-um besides the Holocaust . 1800025_1809785
<I do> I do think however that he's he cannot completely separate himself from the Holocaust . 1809885_1816305
that somehow somewhere it's still part of his identity and he's trying to figure out what to do <with that> <with that> &-um with that tension with that friction . 1816285_1829125
&-um and in this scene it it it comes across as &-uh a a very aggressive &-um criticism of &-um of American Jewry . 1830245_1842165
&-um the the fact that he's yelling I think seems to to suggest that he's ill at ease with &-um with the questions that the judge has been asking him . 1843745_1857405
and it it does raise questions and and &-um Roth leaves &-um he's a writer . 1858025_1868365
and &-uh he leaves the tension unresolved . 1869045_1871465
he doesn't &-um he's he's playing these &-um these two characters &-um against each_other &-um to to &-um to raise the question but <he doesn't> he doesn't resolve the question . 1871465_1887125
&-um he leaves it open . 1888025_1891425
&-um but <he does> he does use the situation I think to &-um to to criticize those who who who end up using the the Holocaust <to give> to give meaning to to their &-um Jewishness or to to give themselves &-um to make themselves right . 1893825_1916825
&-um (0.4) so that the Holocaust becomes a a symbol that's appropriated to to justify any opinion or action . 1919425_1933845
and &-um Nathan &-um appropriates the Holocaust at least in &~fan in fantasy &-um by &-um by imagining that he's going to marry Anne Frank and this is <the most> the most radical way to to proclaim his his loyalty to to Jewishness by by marrying &-um <you know> the most famous &-um Holocaust victim . 1936345_1966325
&-um at least he's trying to to counter the judge's authority <by &-um> by &-um dreaming of this this &-um icon . 1971345_1982805
as a almost as a trophy &-um <in this> in this battle . 1983225_1993065
(0.6) &-um so this brings us to <the second> &-um the second question that I wanted to to &-um examine with you . 1996465_2007645
what are the implications of &-uh remembering the Holocaust through a symbol like Anne Frank . 2008645_2014045
and &-um I should preface the &-um our discussion with a disclaimer . 2015585_2023205
&-um I I recognize that &-uh The Diary of Anne Frank <is a> is a very important and useful tool to introduce the Holocaust &-um especially to to &-uh teenagers to to younger readers &-um but obviously some of you have read it in school or &~hav have any of you ? 2023865_2051565
yeah some people are nodding . 2051275_2052675
so &-um and I and &-um it's a it's &-uh a beautifully written &-um diary it's &-uh it's <an amazing> an amazing document . 2053675_2064775
and &-um &~th through the diary Anne Anne Frank is &-um is a an amazing individual . 2066675_2074655
&-um but learning about the Holocaust through Anne Frank &-um is also problematic because &-um her &-um story tends to obliterate &-um the the the wider story and &-um this is <what I> what I'd like to &-um to examine with you . 2075865_2103605
let me give you &-um the &-um the historical background the the publication <of the> of the book . 2103665_2114665
&-um her diary was first published in nineteen forty seven in Holland and in Dutch . 2115665_2121565
and it was translated to first into French and German in nineteen fifty but it's only in nineteen fifty two when the diary was published in the United States that &-um that it reached a wide audience . 2124065_2145045
and then in nineteen fifty five it was &-um dramatized and produced on Broadway . 2149105_2155765
dramatized by Frances Goodrich and &-uh Albert Hackett &=writing:board became a best seller . 2156415_2181975
&-um and then the story was turned into film in nineteen fifty nine . 2183345_2188705
and &-um and after time the Anne Frank story became the most famous &-um Holocaust story . 2190385_2198305
more people know about the Holocaust through Anne Frank than through any other &-um figure . 2200045_2207285
except except maybe Hitler . 2207785_2209285
but if if someone knows one one person associated <with the> with the Holocaust it it will be Anne Frank . 2209825_2217725
&-um and &~s so &-um Roth I I would argue is &-um is exposing this &-uh this iconization of Anne Frank the turning of Anne Frank into a fetish into an icon in &-um in popular culture in in collective memory . 2218945_2241585
(0.6) here's a a passage in which &-um Nathan is arguing and he said &{l=READING everybody's read the book this is a a story that's too often remembered at the expense of others +... 2247805_2262445
&}l=READING <and he goes on there> &-um but I'd like to examine with you <what kind> what kind of &-um memory the story of Anne Frank fosters . 2269105_2279845
whether whether &-um it's it's an accurate &-uh memory of the Holocaust or whether it's it's distorted . 2280245_2291025
&-um Roth I think &-uh seems to suggests that it's that this &-um turning of Anne Frank into into a symbol is &-um is limiting and it's it's &-uh it's bothersome +... 2293705_2315485
she's she's become a saint . 2316785_2319985
and it's interesting that when he he wrote The Ghost Writer &-um he at first was approaching Anne Frank through through this lens . 2321425_2333125
through this &-um this lens lens of sanctifying this this character . 2333605_2341565
he said &{l=READING when I began I was somehow revering the material . 2341785_2345205
it was the tone appropriate to her geography . 2345885_2348005
instead of Anne Frank gaining new meaning within the context of my story I was trying to draw from the megastore of stock emotions that everybody's supposed to have about her . 2348715_2359015
clinging to the cliche while anxiously waiting for something authentic to take hold . 2359695_2364195
in retrospect my difficulties look somewhat bizarre . 2364775_2368455
because just what Zuckerman was fighting against I was in fact succumbing to the officially authorized and most consuming legend . 2369095_2376315
&}l=READING &-um (0.4) I I'm going to show you &~we we'll take a break then I'll show you the end of &-um of the movie of the nineteen fifty nine movie made after the play . 2378585_2394385
&-um and and then I'd like to to discuss with you why why you think it's &-um this story was so so popular and and &-um what's what's problematic about it . 2396385_2410845
so let's take a break now and come back in a few minutes . 2411265_2426365
(0.10) .

(0.8) .
did you &-uh there are a couple newspaper articles about it a couple weeks ago about the &-uh female Holocaust survivor who just became a rabbi . 2531215_2536975

she's the first female Holocaust survivor <as a rabbi> xxx +/. 2538255_2540795
where ?
+, &-um here in this country I I can't remember all the details but there's one thing I remembered was she was talking about how she knew Anne Frank . 2541355_2557055
+, mhm +/.
+, <I think> I think in the camps .
but she said she didn't like her (be)cause she was bossy and stuff like that xxx . 2550865_2556485
<yeah yeah well> yeah . 2770855_2770895
that's not surprising .
&=laughs .
yeah .
(0.41) &=unintelligible_conversation .
&-um if you have your course packs here the last page of &-um I think it's the last page of the course pack is a handout +... 3121635_3129055
that juxtaposes an excerpt from the diary with an excerpt <from the> from the play and and part of the the dialogue here will be in the scene that I'm going to show you from the movie . 3138365_3151945
&-um (0.5) so if you want if you want to take it out I have some extra ones if &-uh if people need it . 3152465_3165705
otherwise you can just look look over each_other's . 3168155_3171735
we'll discuss this after <after I> &-um after I I show you the piece anybody else ? 3172735_3193995
(0.11) so what I'm going to show you &-um is the the last fifteen minutes of the movie . 3192465_3201305
it's a two and a half hour movie I I'll show the last fifteen minutes . 3202605_3206965
has anybody ever seen the movie ? 3208445_3209985
The Diary of Anne Frank ?
yes . 3210945_3211965
+, you have ? 3212825_3213205
okay . 3213585_3213745
&-um &~i I'm &-uh I'm showing you the end because &-um because I think <it will> it will be &-um <a good> a good point of departure for for our discussion of &-uh why why this story's it has been so popular . 3217585_3234465
so let's &-um let's turn off the lights and &-uh and then when you you watch it try to ask yourselves what what has made this such a popular story ? 3235745_3247885
&=movie_clip (0.23) .
so <what are> what are your your reactions ? 3573475_3574495
sorry <I can't> I can't help but snicker I shouldn't . 4159815_4162515
(0.7) why do you think <this was> &-um this was such a powerful story ? 4163175_4174735
<that it's> that it's obliterated many other stories and that that Anne Frank has &-um has become this &-uh this symbol ? 4174955_4185015
yeah ? 4186435_4186495
I think it's more positive than other other stories about the Holocaust at least that's the way <it appears> I don't know if that's exactly if it's just <straight from> her diary . 4187035_4208755
&-um well the &-um the last line that they are that they're quoting in spite of everything I still believe that people are good at heart &-um was in the diary but it was in the it was in the middle somewhere part of the entries and and her diary is &-um is much much less homogeneous <in its> in its optimism <in its> in its positive +... 4199745_4226405
positive thinking I mean she she goes since it's a diary and it's written &-um at the moment she goes from from &-uh days where she feels good to days <where she> where she she despairs . 4228765_4242765
but the the play and the movie have chosen to emphasize the positive &-um positive sides of the diary . 4243525_4251125
yeah ?
they also seem to emphasize like &-um like a universalism attitude I mean just comparing the text from from her diary where it's all about you know Jewish suffering and +/. 4252285_4261825
mhm +/.
+, you know what what everyone's done to the Jewish people whereas the lines from the movie it's I mean there's no mention of Jews or ⌈ anything it has a universal appeal ⌉ . 4262605_4268945
⌊ yeah yeah let's let's ⌋ look at this &-um let's look at this handout . 4268945_4276725
it's very striking how how the the playwrights have completely distorted the diary &-um +... 4274115_4282915
would someone please read the the passage from the diary I've just typed this just lifted it from the diary . 4284435_4293735
yeah . 4293955_4294875
mhm .
&{l=READING who has inflicted this upon us ? 4295075_4297995
who has made us Jews different from all other people ? 4298115_4300535
who has allowed us to suffer so terribly until now ? 4301185_4303525
it is God that has made us as we are but it will be God too who will raise us up again . 4303925_4308765
if we bear all this suffering and if there are still Jews left when it is over then Jews instead of being doomed will be held up as an example . 4309585_4316945
who knows ? 4317705_4318105
it might even be our religion from which the world and all people learn good and for that reason only do we have to suffer now . 4318225_4324645
&}l=READING .
and this is a this is a a passage in which she expresses &-uh feelings of nationalism even chauvinism and &-um and then the the playwrights have &-uh completely turned this upside down &{l=READING we're not the only people that have hadta suffer there have always been people that have hadta sometimes one race sometimes another . 4326305_4348785
&}l=READING &-um so so you're right that on the this universalization of &-um of her condition as being one of the ways in which the playwrights have &-uh have made it more more accessible and and easier to &-uh to identify with . 4349985_4372025
and Philip Roth talks about that too where he says how you know &~y if Anne Frank had come from some you know some Orthodox family you know Eastern European you know it wouldn't have had nearly the same impact as you know pretty much I mean &~sh &~sh could almost be like a typical American girl at the time . 4372745_4388125
right . 4388685_4388925
&-um actually I think I've was I was planning to communicate this message of something similar and let's see +... 4389305_4398745
right &~le it's on page one forty four I'll just read it to you &-um . 4402215_4406635
what page ? 4407395_4407715
page one forty four one hundred forty four . 4408075_4410095
&{l=READING but that was the point . 4410495_4413775
that was what gave her diary the power to make the <might very real> to expect a great callous and indifferent world to care about the child of a pious bearded father living in the despair of the rabbis and the rituals that was pure folly . 4414075_4427075
to the ordinary person with no great gift for tolerating even the smallest of differences the plight of that family wouldn't mean a thing . 4427225_4433745
to ordinary people it would probably seem that they had invited disaster by stubbornly repudiating everything modern and European not to say Christian . 4434205_4442705
but the family of Otto Frank that would be another matter and &}l=READING by the way &-um the Franks were originally German Jews and they had moved to &-um to Holland &-uh before the war <and then> and then hid in in Amsterdam but they were &-uh virtually not observant . 4443825_4462545
they they did &-um exchange presents at Hanukkah and things like that but <they were> they were not religious at all . 4463825_4469685
&-um &{l=READING how could even the most obtuse of the ordinary ignore what had been done &~t to the Jews just for being Jews . 4470865_4477005
how could even the most benighted of the Gentiles fail to get the idea when they read in Het Achterhuis &}l=READING the &-um the name of &-um the the place where they are hiding the &-um &-uh <how is> how is it called in English ? 4477425_4494045
the annex or &-um they they were hiding <in a> in a part that was &-um &~s &-um camouflaged by by a moving library thing &-um &{l=READING how could even the most benighted of the Gentiles fail to get the idea when they read that once a year the Franks sang the Haumus Hanukkah song said some Hebrew words lighted some candles exchanged some presents a ceremony lasting about ten minutes . 4495065_4525045
<and that> &~wa and that was all it took to make them the enemy . 4526385_4529305
it &~do it did not even take that much . 4529725_4531325
it took nothing . 4531645_4532205
that was the horror . 4532685_4533525
and that was the truth and that was the power of her book . 4533865_4536405
&}l=READING so that fact <that she is> &-um that she is like like everybody else that <she's not> she's not an other . 4537105_4545885
she's not different . 4546405_4547425
&-um makes her a a easier target to identify with . 4548585_4554365
and easier victim to identify with than than if she had been one of the one of the the Polish Jews for example . 4554925_4563545
xxx &-um (0.15) &~w <what else> what else made made her <such a> such a popular &-um icon +..? 4566625_4589865
we talked about the +... 4591645_4594085
the positive &-um &~l let me &-um <pose this> (0.8) what kind_of a what kind of experience does her story represent ? 4597025_4619425
what kind of Holocaust experience does it represent +..? 4619725_4622305
&~wha well what do we see in the film what what images do we see in the film ? 4626565_4629745
(0.6) yeah Tisha ?
they're all almost all positive ones that she'd been <part of> so you don't see like the really big stuff that's displayed in the books and stuff . 4635605_4646865
you don't yeah you don't see the horror right ? 4647105_4650305
<you don't> you don't see yeah Susan ? 4650445_4652305
yeah I I think that's why it makes her so popular too just &~p that's why she's the one everyone knows about because she's not writing about the horror of the concentration camps . 4652995_4661315
she's not telling about how it was she's telling you about hiding . 4661395_4664355
and that granted I'm not saying that was easy but that's completely different than you know people who write about the actual camps . 4664615_4671695
mhm mhm Santo .
yeah I think the Holocaust it is like removed but it's present in the fear of the characters that she like talks about sort_of people in the attic . 4673835_4682975
the thing is is that there are so many authors that wrote about the camps that she present she presents such a different perspective that that hasta appeal to all the &~i like it's probably the world like it would appeal to all the readers than those that would have been reading like <writing after> writing after writing the same thing . 4684615_4700275
I mean it's +//. 4700935_4701415
everybody had their own individual experience but they were all in the same location I mean some type of location whereas like there's not like that many writings of children who were in hiding . 4701735_4710235
and also she's a child or she's a child she's a teenager so like her diary goes through like her interest in Peter and like her family and it lets you into her life and it's not just the concentration camp or just the Holocaust I think it gives you a whole perspective . 4710745_4724645
&-um Mike ? 4725765_4728005
yeah just like an an example of like the way it's constructed the play it's just like an inspirational story like like people love why people like I mean maybe (be)cause it makes them feel better about themselves or even their own kind of pretty good situation compared to hers it &~jus it's just like an example of someone somehow you know raising their spirit and and dealing with something so horrible so positive +/. 4729195_4753555
mhm +/.
+, you_know but at the same time it's probably not representative and it it also is accessible . 4755745_4760145
and like you were &~s like <you were> you were saying it's like a a a way that people can approach the Holocaust without having to approach some of the like specific and actual graphic +//. 4760545_4769865
like it's like a PG rated version &=laughs:multiple almost kind_of compared to like you_know an r@l rated version . 4770405_4777645
like the it describes the camps and things like that you_know . 4778065_4785725
xxx .
she's not just lifting her spirits she kind of redeeming her in in in the book they &-uh they try to send Nathan Zuckerman off to see the play you know to like cleanse his soul of all these you know bad ideas and then in the last scene there she's simply ministering to the to Peter <up in the> up in the attic like the light streaming in on her <from the> from the window . 4783455_4803115
yeah &-um she's &-um there's a_lot_of &-uh a_lot_of &-um really good things have been said but the idea that her her story is obliterating the horror but it's also &-uh redeeming our our idea of &-um the human spirit . 4808265_4824785
&~i I want to &-um read you &-um a sentence from the preface to the &-um American edition of the diary . 4825085_4834085
and the preface was written by Eleanor Roosevelt . 4834605_4836145
&-um the President's wife at the time . 4837625_4839965
and she wrote that Anne &~bo Anne Frank's book made her I quote &{l=READING shockingly aware of war's greatest evil the degradation of the human spirit but at the same time Anne's diary makes &~po poignantly clear the ultimate shining nobility of that spirit . 4840805_4859405
&}l=READING and &-um it's &-um &~i it's again this idea that &-um her story only gives us a a limited awareness of &-um of of the history of the Holocaust and &-um and makes avoiding the the center of the the tragedy possible . 4860425_4878625
&-um and and the Roth even even questions whether reading Anne Frank's diary really makes makes its readers &-um better person better people better individuals whether the readers of the diary are improved &-um morally . 4880225_4904805
and I I wanted to &-um to look at a passage in the novel it's on page one forty five one forty six . 4905765_4914785
(0.5) and this is &-um +... 4915365_4920885
written from the point of view of this fantasized Anne Frank who would've survived in &-uh Nathan's imagination . 4921345_4933165
&-um &{l=READING this was the &~les the lesson that on the journey home she came to believe she had the power to teach . 4935065_4941645
&}l=READING &-um &~th the lesson about about &-um about Holocaust . 4942705_4949665
&{l=READING were Het Achterhuis known to be the work of a living writer it will never be more than it was a young teenager's diary of her trying years in hiding during the German occupation of Holland . 4950285_4962865
something boys and girls could read in bed at night along with the adventures of the Swiss Family Robinson . 4963235_4968255
but dead she had something more to offer than amusement for ages ten fifteen . 4969435_4973875
dead she had written without meaning to or trying to a book with the force of a masterpiece to make people finally see . 4974315_4982215
and when people had finally seen when they had learned what she had the power to teach them what then ? 4983635_4990595
would suffering &~to come to mean something new to them ? 4990975_4993755
could she actually make them humane creatures for any longer than the few hours it would take to read her diary through ? 4994175_5001235
in her room at &-um at the &}l=READING in <in the> in the plot of this novel &{l=READING after hiding in her dresser the three copies of Het Achterhuis she thought more calmly about her readers to be than she had while pretending to be one of them &-um of the story bust right through the lightning storm . 5002665_5021705
she was not after all the fifteen year+old who could while hiding from the Holocaust tell Kitty &}l=READING Kitty's her &-um imaginary friend in the diary that she writes to &{l=READING I still believe that people are really good at heart . 5021745_5034865
her youthful ideas had suffered no less than she had in the windowless freight car from Westerbork . 5035305_5040825
and in the barracks at Auschwitz and then on the Belsen Heath . 5041705_5044685
she had not come to hate the human race for what it was . 5045025_5047485
what could it be but what it was ? 5047905_5049225
but she did not feel singing anymore singing its praises . 5049225_5052965
what would happen when people had finally seen ? 5054445_5057485
the only realistic answer was nothing . 5057925_5059865
to believe anything else was only to give to longings which even she the great longer had a right to question by now . 5061445_5068405
&}l=READING so so Roth is really questioning what the &-um whether the diary is is teaching people to &-um to be more moral human beings . 5069825_5085105
and one of the reasons why he's questioning that is precisely because &-um because she's a a character that is so easy to empathize with . 5085205_5095665
if she were an other then then the reader of the diary would &-um would be forced to to make a moral leap and to identify with someone &-um that is not easy to identify with . 5095825_5109545
but because because she's so sympathetic &-uh the reader doesn't really have to to &-uh to make much of a a moral effort to to &-um identify with her story . 5110225_5124165
so this is what what &-um Roth is implying here . 5124385_5128545
&-um (0.5) I also wanted to to comment on this &-um this idea that &-um that her story's &-um is used to to redeem the idea of of &-um a the +... 5129505_5150865
the &~sh shining nobility of the the human spirit as &-um Eleanor Roosevelt says . 5151785_5159485
and &-um especially the play and the film by ending <on this> on this &-uh uplifting statement &-um turn her story into a a cathartic story . 5156585_5170645
<they give> they give the audience the illusion of having been purged of &-um of the horrible story and &-um +... 5171505_5180925
of &-um <of having> of having escaped &-um the horror <it's a> it's a feel good play . 5186505_5196145
it's it's &-um in the end it's it's a play it's a movie that &-uh that makes you cry a little bit and then go home and and forget about it . 5196865_5206665
I mean this is &-um again expressed in &-um in The Ghost Writer . 5206925_5215465

xxx Keisha ?
&{l=READING it wasn't the play I could have watched that easily enough if I had been alone . 5235895_5238975
it was the people &~wa with watching with me . 5239255_5241635
carloads of women kept running up <to the> &~tem to the theater women wearing fur coats with expensive shoes and handbags . 5241775_5247735
I thought this isn't for me . 5248455_5249795
the billboards the photographs the marquee <I could> I could take all that . 5249975_5254275
but it was the women who frightened me and their families and their children and their homes . 5254535_5258235
go to a movie I told myself go instead to a museum . 5258915_5261795
but I showed my ticket I went in with them and of_course it happened . 5262385_5265425
it hadta happen it's what happens there . 5266265_5268665
the women cried . 5269045_5269725
everyone around me was in tears . 5269965_5272005
then at the end in the row behind me a woman screamed oh no . 5272145_5275905
that's why I came running home . 5276285_5277725
&}l=READING .
okay good . 5277985_5292205
one second .
running home +/.
this is just another funny passage in in the novel in which Roth is &-uh is mocking the the effect of &-um <of this> of this play and the the women are &-um can afford to to &-uh wallow in in luxury because &-um because they go to this play to purge themselves and then &-um they come out and it's and life goes on . 5284235_5313515
&-um they exorcise their their &-um +... 5315305_5321345
maybe they give for for living in luxury or &-um for for having not hadta experience the Holocaust . 5324385_5345285
and &-uh <as I> as I said the the play and the film emphasize Anne Frank's &-uh positive side and even her moralizing side . 5337305_5348805
in the diary she's much more irreverent . 5349145_5351325
and &-um &-um there's a documentary that was made a few years ago called Anne Frank Remembered which I I recommend to you if you're interested in Anne Frank's story in which &-um many of her contemporaries were interviewed about her . 5351465_5367645
and &-um and they revealed that she was actually a a much more mischievous little girl than &-um than she's made out to be in &-um in the film The Diary of Anne Frank where she's &-um she's turned into a sentimental saint . 5367825_5385865
&-um and it I I'm just going to read you some reviews of of the play that were that came out in &-um in fifty five . 5388145_5397945
the play was &-uh was incredibly successful and and won &-uh prizes . 5398245_5403185
&-um and it was reviewed as &{l=READING a lovely tender drama &}l=READING &-uh one reviewer &~t wrote about &{l=READING the happy effect of animating everyone into doing a little more than he's capable of doing . 5405905_5420445
&}l=READING &-um someone wrote about it <as a> as a &{l=READING not a war play or even a sad play . 5420925_5425925
&}l=READING so this is what her story &-um became . 5426205_5431045
the the diary itself is &-uh is incredibly powerful because &~sh she develops into a &-um a a very &-um fine human being in just the course of of two years . 5431865_5447625
it's it's amazing &-um to think that she was only fourteen when she was writing what she was writing . 5447865_5453285
but the the play just &-um completely softens her her personality and her and then the whole whole reality around her . 5454185_5464985
&-um it turns the whole thing into a melodrama . 5466485_5469365
&-um (0.5) &~sh she was actually a much more ambivalent character and &-uh the the influence of the play and of the movie have been long lasting and have not only obliterated the the horror of the Holocaust itself but the the the true story of Anne Frank . 5471745_5494725
and &-um even thirty years after the play in nineteen eighty five &-uh Congress passed a joint resolution to designate &-um June twelfth nineteen eighty five as Anne Frank Day and &-um they explain why why they chose to do that . 5495945_5517465
and I'm quoting here from the resolution they wanted &-um &{l=READING the people of the nation to reflect on the message of Anne Frank that in the face of evil it is possible to retain a belief in humanity . 5517945_5530665
&}l=READING and they they they &-um they just lifted this from from the play and from the movie . 5531985_5537065
I don't think they even bothered to to &-uh go and check &=laughs the diary &-um so so it it's interesting to to see how how memory this collective memory's shaped and &-um it's it's important to to remain critical of that process . 5537485_5557325
yeah ? 5557705_5557785
Philip Roth kind of puts it in religious tones too when he has the idea of &-uh you know Anne Frank dying then sort_of being resurrected . 5558285_5565025
yes +/.
+, you know there's this kind_of like Christian idea +/. 5565505_5567205
+, yeah +/.
+, in the part when he talking about how why it is that she hasta die you know why she hasta be dead it's because you know what would you know something like Christianity be if you know Jesus hadn't died you know . 5567765_5577705
right .
right she can only be a saint <if she> if she died . 5578005_5581865
<if she> if she had survived she would be &-um her her experience of &-um hiding for two years would would be of no consequence even though it would be would've been the same experience and and &-um also &-um worthy of of knowing . 5582465_5600265
but &-uh you're right . 5600685_5602525
and and &-uh Roth read by by resurrecting her is also &-um refusing to to &-uh to preserve this &~sentiment sentimentalized image and he turns this this imaginary Anne into &-um into <a cynical> &-um a cynical survivor +... 5604785_5627245
&-um at the ending of Roth's novel is &-uh acting the &-um &-um a direct response to to the ending of the film &-um he's &-um he's mocking this this kitschy &-uh Hollywoodish &=laughs ending of &-um Anne and Peter kissing fashionably <when the> when the Nazis come up the stairs . 5630905_5657565
&-um he ends his novel with with &-um a scene in which the wife of &-uh Lonof which is Nathan's mentor is &-um is leaving in the snow is is stomping in the snow she's leaving this marriage that's a trap for her and &-um ironically her name is Hope . 5658105_5679405
&=laughs this is you know I think a direct response to to the line in the movie &~w we we &-um have been two years in fear now <we will> we will live &-um in hope . 5682245_5692685
I think he's &-um +... 5693945_5695145
he's just playing with that <and &-um> and &-um turning it upside down . 5698185_5702785
and and basically he's saying you know my my novel is not uplifting it's it's made you laugh but &-um but <I won't> I won't let you off the hook here I'm I'm not going to write a cathartic novel I won't let you hope too much so yeah . 5704345_5733605
there's also kind of the part when he's in the study at night like listening you know like a_lot_of you know Anne Frank hadta do with you know these people listening you know waiting to hear people come up the stairs and so he's listening and he hears these people who are you know getting to bed or you know whatever like +/. 5720915_5735495
yeah +/.
+, those kind of stuff uses a_lot_of the same kind of ⌈ xxx ⌉ . 5736415_5737975
⌊ yes yeah ⌋ he's he's rewriting the diary . 5738075_5741175
&-um but he's rewriting for &-um satirical purposes not not &-uh for sentimental purposes . 5742065_5752385
so &-um (0.6) so &-um &~i I wanted to to raise a_lot_of &-um questions regarding the the &-um the issue of &-um Jewish collective memory and and also &~Amer American collective memory of the Holocaust . 5753905_5779285
