okay guys and ladies what we are going to try to figure out today
+^ we wanna find all of them that we can all the
how many different core squares do you think we'll be able to make ?
Brittany what do you think ? 374770_375653
two . 375653_376243
you think there's only gonna be two ways to do it ? 376243_378373
what makes you think that ? 378373_379372
tell us more about your +/. 379372_380452
(be)cause if four of each color and each core square has um
Saad sit up straight please and keep your head off xxx . 398100_400215
+< xxx . 400215_400800
Brittany you're suppose +//. 400800_402022
you'll you can have an unlimited number of blue and green
once we've shown a way you'll be able to use those squares again to
so Brittany was right in her thinking though . 411037_413990
she noticed that she had only eight squares in front of her . 413990_418100
and she knew that it that each of her core squares was divided
so she thought that if she used up all of her squares the most she
but I'm asking how many different ways we can make a core square
but after you've shown me one way you can wipe it off and show me a
so you could continue using your eight squares in different ways . 447992_451957
so how many possibilities do you think there are for core
what are you thinking ? 463095_464103
Jillian ? 464103_464672
I think five . 464672_466415
you think there are five different ways ? 466415_468207
tell us a little bit about why you think it would work out that we
well because I I took um like these squares and I knew
and then um if you took like um the green the whole
okay can I stop you for a minute ? 530008_531920
so what +//. 531920_532905
because if you share all your ways they won't have to do any
so what you did while I was outlining the problem for you is you
(o)kay does anyone think there might be a different number of ways
if we wanna make sure each one is different from the
how many ways do you think we might be able to find ? 557870_560332
Kevin . 560332_561052
um three . 561052_561980
you think there's only three ways ? 561980_563763
yeah . 563763_563899
okay tell us a little bit about why you think there are three ways
