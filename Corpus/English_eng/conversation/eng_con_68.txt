I heard it .
then I didn't hear it .
but it simply was .
one guy was going to meet another guy .
he hadn't seen him in a number of years .
the other fellow was saying .
that he wasn't who he say he was .
I apologize because I didn't listen to what he said .
I listened .
I didn't hear what he said why he wasn't who he thought he was .
that's about it .
it ended so abruptly .
I didn't really hear what he said .
so I didn't really hear the storyline .
about what it was really about .
well I had done pretty much about everything I wanted to do .
even though I don't have no education .
I had worked and done pretty good until this stroke .
you can hear me, I can't talk .
I can't walk but up until then I was doing pretty good .
I'm sixty two years old .
right now I'm not doing too bad because I wash myself .
I take care of myself .
I feed myself .
I live with my one of my daughters .
I take care of me .
I do everything that I can do .
so far it's a couple of things that's more aggravating than
I don't hurt .
I can't walk right .
I used to walk all over this city .
northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest .
I used to walk all over now I can't walk a block without stopping .
get me rest .
walk a little further .
get me some rest .
just there like that they are more aggravating than anything else .
like I said .
I know that I'm getting older .
that kind_of gets me down .
I have always been a person .
I have gone everywhere .
I have driven all over this country .
I have been all over this country .
I used to do what I wanted to do .
now I cannot do that's .
that's aggravating .
it makes me angry, more than anything else .
I'm not doing to awful bad .
I saw my kids .
actually I have two .
I have a boy and a girl .
her birthday was last month .
his birthday was in June .
so there not made me happy .
so neither did I .
so I just leave them .
they are doing the same things that I did .
which is not good .
there is nothing I can do about it .
last Saturday I was over in Baltimore .
(be)cause my daughter turned twenty five .
I told her I said .
today's your day if you goof up .
you ain't but twenty five one time .
tomorrow you back on the case .
I can't say .
the only thing is .
I'm disappointed in the way they turned out .
I'm saying I got a little time .
my son is getting older .
he is thirty four .
my daughter turned twenty five .
I used to think when she was born .
aw, I got a girl .
no boys don't have any sense (be)cause I got a girl .
I thought she'd have sense .
she just as crazy as he is .
she ain't no better .
they are not in jail .
so I should be grateful .
besides I gotta watch them for the weekend so that's good .
so far I'm doing pretty well .
lady was shopping .
she dropped her wallet .
when she got her things .
got to take out counter .
she ain't have no way to pay for her groceries .
I forgot how you said she got home .
she got home .
she got there .
the telephone rang .
it was the little girl saying .
she had found her wallet .
she had said +"/.
+" oh no .
she had found her wallet
