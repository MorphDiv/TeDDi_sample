can anyone tell me different a different movement to turn
you can't say flip it right you can't say flip it left you can't
<can you tell> can you tell me another movement . 153247_156835
Nicole go ahead (be)cause +... 156835_158405

+< okay okay shh . 190847_192788
oh Amanda please close your desk and have your eyes up here . 192788_196493
we're gonna wait (un)till Amanda's watching (be)cause
okay what Nicole is describing she said I should take the bottom of
excuse me Kelly you're eyes are not up here that disturbs me and
eyes up here . 218255_220203
Nicole says I should try taking the bottom of Brian's core square
hmm what do I have ? 231153_232690
Brian's . 232690_233978
+< Brian's core square . 233978_235660
no but what did Nicole describe for me a different movement a
yes . 241093_241618
+< yes . 241618_242298
(be)cause was her flip different from yours Justin ? 242298_244363
yeah . 244363_244997
yeah she flipped hers I don't know how did you how did I
forward . 248450_249130
flipped it forward ? 249130_250380
okay . 250380_251292
Nathan what are you oh wait wait you already shared a movement
can anyone think of a way that they could turn Brian's into the one
+^ Brittany . 265303_266078
um xxx um if you turn it to the left and then and then end up right
um you you began by saying I should turn it to the left . 279168_283612
I need to ask you how much . 283612_284985
all the way around . 284985_286097
one whole time ? 286097_288195
yeah . 288195_288550
how will it look if I turn it to the left one whole time ? 288550_290490
+< the same ! 290490_290922
it looks like that <but then> but then you flip it to the right .
(o)kay why would I need to turn it first before I flipped it if it
let's see what Brittany asked me to do was turn it to the left one
okay does that give us Kelly's ? 311015_314077
yeah . 314077_314775
yep and that's a way that no one described before isn't it ? 314775_318517
who can give me another way to move or manipulate Brian's core
Jillian what are you thinking ? 327583_329118
um turn it one half one fourth to the left . 329118_336543
one fourth to the left . 336543_339473
and then turn it another fourth . 339473_341143
okay what's one fourth and one fourth when you put em
one eighth . 344370_345643
one fourth . 345643_346938
two fourths and what's the other way to say two fourths ? 346938_350138
two turns . 350138_353465
the other fraction that means the same as two fourths . 353465_359232
how far around did I turn it if I turn it one fourth and then
+< half . 363983_364610
twice . 364610_364817
+< a half a half it was a half a turn watch that again . 364817_368563
so what Jillian had me do is go to the left which no one had me do
she could have said to me turn left one half but she just said turn
it did give me Kelly's square . 384662_386693
so is this um core square here Kelly's um description of a
yes . 395415_396327
some of em that Brian's it's it's it's not
+< no . 396775_397285
+< no . 397285_400340
right so it's not a different way to do it is it ? 400340_403208
is xxx even on her way that um . 403208_406970
hold on we're not done I have to label that um Kelly the way you
so so far how many ways have we found to make a core square with
+< three . 417807_418538
three one two three but we can make Brian and Kelly's core square
but that gave us a good chance to talk about what Jillian pointed
okay ? 446370_447510
let's see if someone can suggest for us another way to make a core
Sarah put your pencil away sit down flat at your desk and be paying
+< I can't see though . 461275_462880
I bet you can now if you can't something's wrong you know but I
I think if you tried looking up at the black board you'd be able to
okay who found a different way as they moved their blue and green
make sure you check the ways we already have and see if it's really
Amanda describe for me what you're thinking of . 483547_486092
