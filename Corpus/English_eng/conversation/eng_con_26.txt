the story is about O'Henry .
and him and his friend had not seen each other for twenty years .
and they were supposed to meet at this particular restaurant .
and Jimmy was late .
and Henry was trying to figure out, I guess, why Jimmy was late .
and he went to the restaurant where they were supposed to meet .
and he wasn't there .
and he I guess was walking around trying to figure out where he
and what was going on with him .
and finally he lit a cigarette .
I guess to calm himself down because he hadn't seen this man in
and when he lit the cigarette the guy, Jimmy, saw his face .
and he remembered that this was the man they was looking for .
for something he had done bad, I think .
and they his friend wouldn't do it because, I guess,
so he had to call someone else to arrest him .
and then he sent him a note saying what why he couldn't do it .
and that was it .
in growing up in South_Carolina we had a playhouse .
and we had three big cherry trees .
and my mom always said +"/.
+" do not climb the cherry tree .
+" and do not eat those cherries unless you wash
so of_course we being children decided .
mom was going out .
and we were going to do our own thing .
so my sister Trudy, Maryland, and myself decided we were going to
get our cherries down .
and we were going to make some wine .
so we did .
only thing we had for the wine was Coca_Cola bottles .
the great big Coca_Cola bottles .
and we had to wash them out real good .
steal my momma's dish detergent and everything .
she was upset .
but we got it .
and we washed the bottles out real good .
cleaned the tops .
and stole some of her sugar .
and we put our cherries .
we had a half bottle of cherries .
and the other half was water .
and we put in as much sugar as it could hold .
so that it wouldn't be too full at the top .
shook it up real good .
and buried it .
and it stayed buried for three years .
we went in after three years .
took the wine up .
after taking the wine up .
we got our little cups and glasses and whatever .
and we decided we were going to drink the wine .
of_course you know what happened .
we got sick .
but we were drunk .
so mom came home of_course .
she was working at this time .
she came home .
we were all sitting like you_know just out of it because we
we had this wine .
we were drunk .
and we felt bad .
but we couldn't explain why .
so she decided to check out what was going on in the playhouse .
and she found the wine Coca_Cola bottles sitting on our little
and she got a switch .
and that was the end of the story .
she wore us out .
