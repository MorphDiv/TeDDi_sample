would look like . 0_580
no no . 1040_1620
but by trying their two strips together in different ways they
and then they colored in on the graph paper six strips worth of
and this is the design they like . 19790_21260
so you already know what Sarah and Katie's finished quilt is going
it's gonna be blue and orange with six rows six strips . 27190_31590
nope has to be six has to be six . 32860_35190
'cause that's the finished size . 35900_36800
what they are going to do today then is the next step that was just
you still have to make the quilt after that . 45300_47130
and your quilt needs to be finished by the end of tomorrow . 47240_50080
so if you're still in the planning stages so work time is over
are you on track ahead or behind behind . 56510_60000
you need to finish your the design part of the task very quickly
'cause you had lots_of time for that . 65800_66960
Tuesday okay . 68020_69600
what they we'll need to do now is to make the strips they need . 70290_74890
and then to start pulling the construction paper on them to make
I'll show you one more time how we're gonna build these strips that
okay . 87330_87560
you and your partner need to both watch carefully so that you can
when you get there we start with the two by two grids which are
Katie and Sarah this counts as an official warning for today . 101260_105320
if I need to give either of . 105360_106480
you a reminder . 106530_107010
you take a behavior letter home that was too many times for the
I'm cutting around the edges on three sides . 114720_116880
but I'm leaving this big wide space . 117200_120200
remember the lines of the grid on three sides . 120780_126370
just those three skinny sides around the edge . 126490_128600
so all we'll have left are core squares . 128810_131290
and I kept that right off . 131960_133170
so what I have then is a piece that looks like that with no wedges
but big a big white space there . 137840_139920
what do I do . 140850_141450
next . 141500_141690
very good . 144090_144490
I'm gonna cut right through the middle and what will those big
mhm tabs for gluing my strip together . 151730_154520
so I'm gonna put glue on one of those big white tabs right now . 156560_160250
not the other one yet because I don't have what I need . 161120_164070
and then this part is &-um I need to line up very carefully the
so there's not could I glue it like like this with space
'cause then my design of my quilt would've spaces between you get
right . 179400_179620
and it and your pattern wouldn't turn out 'cause the shapes
there'd be white space between them . 183000_184590
it's easier to do this when it's laying flat . 185430_187300
but there I wind up my core squares . 187380_189180
then how many core squares do I have arranged . 189620_191150
four one . 191630_192630
two three four . 193180_193860
right . 194010_194260
so my strip isn't done yet . 194680_195790
I take another sheet like that and do the same thing to it . 196840_201100
I cut off those three skinny edges right around the edge . 201200_204390
and I try to cut right on that line that is the edge of the cores
so it'll stay the right side . 211700_212460
I really don't want any white around the edges . 213210_215150
because then my strips won't end up being exactly six core squares
and then the white edges will show on my finished crop . 221630_224180
so you'll probably put a little less quickly than me . 224660_227420
now what do I do . 227660_228070
the middle . 229980_230310
well I need to use both these . 231120_232020
no you can . 232220_233190
yeah . 235610_235780
well the next that can go toward the next strip we make . 235800_238060
'cause yeah we're not gonna make this one strip . 238610_239950
we're gonna make six strips . 240000_241050
so now I can put the glue on that extra tab that I had from before
because I can get . 246630_247150
my new stick up . 247170_248000
and then my strip must be finished . 249710_253600
because . 255680_255840
I have one two three four five . 255970_259670
six cut off that white part . 259990_261620
yeah . 262270_262440
that's the only white part that gets put out . 262670_264680
when when you check to make sure you have six core wheres you
and that will get thrown away . 270430_271390
and then you have a strip that is just there . 271410_274040
and then you can put it . 276100_276760
see . 276950_277030
so then I would've here's two that are just the same size . 277170_279200
and if this was one group I would need four more . 279390_281740
'cause then those arranged together we'll make the finished quilt .
and we'll glue them on . 285470_286160
then a large piece of colored paper &-um . 286240_289310
this . 290360_290470
&-um you'll get taken off . 294710_295950
okay . 297480_297720
you can see how they had their strips . 298160_299790
and then once their strips were done I gave them a large sheet of
and they glued their strips on in the right order . 303070_305390
so the quilt had a border around it where they could write the
and then we're gonna hang them up for display . 310170_311630
okay . 312430_312670
so you need once your six strips are finished then I'll give you a
I one . 318890_319150
because those are like circles . 319210_320560
this one . 321730_322130
no . 322720_322780
the one right next_to it . 322940_323850
this one . 324010_324400
yeah that one . 324540_325140
yeah that's that's an evening star kind of designed done in
but it's made from strips . 330360_331480
not two by twos but the design that they plan with their strips . 331640_334410
no blue and orange and red green . 335310_336620
<we didn't> we didn't make it like a circle kind of thing . 337200_340150
it's not really circular . 342000_342920
it's done in a pattern very much . 343920_345560
let's see who's using a courseware like that . 345750_348040
this time . 348150_348520
Danny and Nicole have a course . 352150_354460
now they're they're not using Purple and yellow . 354600_356400
they chose as a color scheme red and green . 356490_358740
but they have a core square very similar to the one that &-um Danny
that picture's actually glued upside-down . 364880_366710
there's Danny and Becky saying . 367390_368500
yep . 368690_368820
that's who made that one last year . 368840_370100
I'd . 372410_372470
yeah . 372750_372830
okay . 373310_373510
so are there any questions from any of the payers about what to do
'cause now you'll have about one hour to work . 378940_381060
and you need to get beyond the designing stage . 381700_384280
you need to get beyond &-um designing strips . 384970_388420
choosing a favorite strip coloring the flip side and planning with
what your whole quilt will look like . 394470_396620
to actually working with the colored paper on the long strips to
'cause if you don't get that far today I'm worried that you won't
okay . 409910_410070
does anyone have questions about what to do . 410390_412380
the whiteboard reminds you what to do up through step six . 412500_415780
what would step seven be if it was listed up there . 416590_419460
&-um <make your> make your strip . 419940_421750
make your strips . 422700_423380
and after you make your strips what . 423510_424740
and you this is Curtis . 425060_427840
no on this one . 430510_431560
but you're right . 431960_432310
and this will help you . 432380_433350
this will show you how to make &-um your strips . 433400_436140
you'll just have to be careful that you and your partner understand
if you're using a flip strip so that they'll go together . 442810_445740
okay . 446730_446820
or if it even if it's all <copy strip> copy strip <coffee strip
if you look we're looking at the original strip side of your strip
but your partner was looking at the flip side of it . 456530_458980
and started gluing them all down on paper . 459280_460700
then your design wouldn't turn out the way you had planned . 460720_462700
make sure that you're looking at the part that you really wanted to
yeah . 470230_470390
and you'll also be able to tell which is the flip side because the
they're not . 477240_477710
so your flip side is the part that doesn't have the black lines . 478230_480390
take . 480910_481130
mhm . 482300_482520
half of it . 482990_483450
half of . 485440_485590
it each person take three strips . 485920_488220
unless you're in the group of three . 488520_489580
then each person gets to take two strips of it home . 489600_491750
right . 491930_492020
we divide the quilt evenly between the people who made it . 492120_494670
you slice it . 495250_495990
mhm . 496350_496540
at the end of the quilt . 498900_499820
not until we've had (th)em up and display them around the school
while . 503540_503630
guys and ladies find a spot for you and your partner to work and
Carrie and Katie your things are up for us . 511580_513340
well get that straightened . 514789_516059
let's see if it matches what she has . 517130_518409
'cause she had this little . 519000_519460
let's how far are you guys in your design . 521429_524780
&-um I think Teddy's I got this like that . 525860_529590
he's still working on that . 530430_531790
what's different about that . 532820_534020
in this . 534060_534360
he's still working on his fruit . 535270_536780
&-um see take away this &-um this design . 536980_541620
just right here is this . 541830_542940
and keep on tapping it . 543100_545060
and he's still herky . 545140_546670
and he's working on this one . 547260_548850
but &-um yeah . 549020_550330
uhhuh . 551260_551320
how did you . 551460_551830
how did you decide on this . 552310_553850
design what how does it . 553960_555430
this design . 555550_556180
yeah . 556830_556950
what's the pattern . 557120_557660
is this . 557740_558070
how the qui goes when you're . 558120_559590
&-uh no . 559640_560420
we're not making the qui . 560450_561470
oh . 561770_561870
you're just making the . 561920_562660
yeah . 563950_564170
we're making the &-um the . 564410_565280
