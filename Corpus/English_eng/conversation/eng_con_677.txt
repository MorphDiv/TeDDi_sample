&~www .
there is this boy in my form who is probably the naughtiest boy in
(be)cause he &-er during lessons <he &-er> <he &-er>
walking outside of the room .
0 comes back in &-er .
and the teachers let him ?
no they &-er the teachers still shout at him .
but <the teacher> the teachers can't really do a lot .
so so he just walks around .
and then he &-er starts breaking stuff from the radiator .
&-er and while there are people reading reading stuff out or
and making other stuff with (th)em .
and then he starts walking around making noises of animals .
