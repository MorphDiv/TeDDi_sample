our class today . 545_1625
&-um one is Diane she's a GSI &-um so she's just observing . 2225_6365
and &-um I'm sorry I don't know your name . 7425_8745
Janine . 8925_9145
Janine she's &-um gonna tell you a little bit more about what she's doing that's why we have a microphone just so you all know what's going on and consent to it . 9305_17565
&=micase_related_speech .
okay . 218635_218875
alright .
so I hope that's not gonna make you all &-um self-conscious &-um (be)cause we won't have a very good class if you are but &-um +... 219295_230515
today I wanted to talk about &-um we'll partially talk about the lectures that we had this week which were about political systems and I wanted to start off doing that by talking about power and social organization social control . 233495_248995
maybe you wanna talk to her after just to make sure &-um that you know what's going on with that . 249435_253415
okay .
so you had some reading on this in your textbook . 254215_260875
&-um I thought it was pretty advanced a_lot_of the concepts that were talked about in there and so maybe we could just talk about how these sort_of apply to your own experiences . 261995_275775
so I was hoping you could just sort of throw out some ideas about how social control works in our society . 277615_287335
basically why do you do all of the things that you do ? 287565_292005
&-um <if you> if you go into &-um a store and you see something that you really want and you can't afford it why don't you just take it +..? 292845_306625
assuming that you don't of_course . 309365_310185
Chris .
well when you're younger you do . 310445_312045
&=laughs:multiple .
I think though that's that's a good point actually . 312985_315145
so let's let's keep that in mind . 315635_317335
and sometimes that when you're older you still do like if you're a if you're a criminal . 317475_321655
&=laughs:multiple .
sure . 322235_323755
I mean I I mean social control is obviously not perfect . 324075_327815
so &-um &=writing:board so &~yo so young people . 328455_337495
&-um what does that tell us about young people &-um if young people are more likely to say steal something ? 337675_344015
you might wanna talk to her after class just to find out what she's doing and whether you wanna participate in it . 345615_352495
⌈ that's you ⌉ .
⌊ me ⌋ ?
okay . 353215_353875
&=laughs:multiple .
&-um okay so what does that what does that tell us already if if young people are more likely to steal things than than &~o &-um older people ? 354395_365315
yeah . 366795_367015
either that they're more rebellious or maybe or just that they're not as accustomed to society's norms yet . 367195_373935
yeah that's yeah I mean yeah rebellious or or not we we could call it socialized . 374195_382815
which basically just means they're not accustomed to society's norms yet . 383315_387555
yeah . 387735_387775
or they're just too young to understand the &-uh consequences of stealing . 387915_391135
oh that's yeah and this is important &-um the consequences +... 391625_396065
somebody else have something they wanted to say ? 400165_401085
there also like isn't like as many consequences for them . 401845_404525
yeah that's true I mean &-um why do you think that there are not as many consequences ? 405365_410245
I mean <why do> why do &-um why does society +//. 411125_413205
why is our society set up so there won't be as many consequences ? 413665_416185
(be)cause they aren't gonna like throw like a six year+old in jail for like stealing something or like make him pay a big fine he'll probably just &~turn return it ⌈ if like ⌉ . 419325_428225
⌊ I mean ⌋ that's absolutely true but I mean why what is it that what is the value behind that ? 428465_433405
what is the idea behind that ? 433585_435185
yeah . 435765_436345
I mean I think we could talk about like the six year old boy with like the gun obviously you know &-uh +/. 436465_441405
yeah . 441405_441625
+, it's like they live in a dream world kinda . 442005_444345
you know how you like when you're young you have like imaginary friends and like you just have like your own little world and you you really believe it . 444365_451145
⌈ you don't think ⌉ . 451205_451905
⌊ okay that's definitely &-um ⌋ that's definitely important . 451905_455265
yeah ? 456105_457225
to like to kids the only consequence like of stealing is getting what they're stealing . 457485_461405
like there's no like punishment and for the kid like shooting that girl to him he was like repaying her for hitting him (be)cause I think that was what the thing was like that was the only consequence he didn't think he was gonna kill her I mean he doesn't he just thinks he's gonna pay her back like he . 461515_474695
right he he only like understood death by how the movie portrayed it . 474735_478195
like big deal like another one like in &~T in t@l two like thousands of people die . 478455_482935
you know to him &=laughs:multiple . 483175_485115
so why is it why is it that young children don't understand say about what it means to kill somebody ? 485825_493985
and it's not a difficult question really I'm just trying to get you to ⌈ really spell it out ⌉ . 495685_501045
⌊ they've never really seen it ⌋ +/.
sorry ?
+, I mean they've never they +//. 502005_503325
when you're little your parents don't expose you to death like my parents like when my grandparents died and I was like four or five they didn't take me to the funeral so like I was never exposed to death until I was like old enough to like handle it . 502845_513985
so basically you could say that &-um basically &~s alright if young people are not socialized and they're protected they're not yet socialized they're protected . 515025_523285
&-um the period of of youth is one I mean I'm sort_of drawing on your comments and sort_of adding to them but the period of of youth is one where where people get socialized where people get taught . 524185_539485
&-um what they need to know in_order_to live in society say . 541025_545945
and they're protected so that they don't learn everything too fast . 547505_553085
is that I mean is that one of the values of our society ? 553485_556725
I know you probably heard that before &-um so I mean what is it that they're being taught ? 557445_565225
I mean for one thing they're being taught well I'll move this over they're being taught consequences right ? 565405_572285
(be)cause you said they didn't know what the consequences are . 571925_575945
&-um what else yeah . 577465_578485
they don't like they don't know the difference between right and wrong for like a certain amount of time and so if you teach (th)em everything if you teach (th)em how to like use a gun then they don't know if it's right or wrong to use the gun . 579145_590245
yeah so they're being taught morals . 591265_593945
did you have something to say ? 595785_597585
that's what I was gonna say . 601165_601905
anything else that they're being taught ? 601275_602895
yeah . 605455_605735
well it's like and a_lot_of times when you see movies and kids are like exposed to &=window_slams_shut &=laughs:multiple . 606075_610815
just ignore it .
when kids are exposed to some like murders later on in life they have problems . 610895_617215
you know what I mean if they're exposed to something too early and later on they have problems like being abused you know later on they have problems it's like you know like . 617775_624175
yeah that's true &~or yeah &~or right so I guess that falls <under the> under the category of of we protect them from learning things too quickly . 625515_632915
&-um <is there> is there a connection ? 633495_638175
between between consequences and morals ? 638595_641235
(0.5) I mean &~i basically <these are> these are these are things both of them that &-um our society has decided that that &-um or someone it's not I mean it's not something that you know everyone in the society obviously sat down and decided but &-um somehow we've come to this agreement that young people need to learn consequences &-um and they need to learn morals . 646485_671465
yeah . 672465_672625
I think they use the consequences to teach morals . 673205_676725
yeah that's a good that's a good one . 678205_680125
&=writing:board so basically &-um what kinds of consequences are there ? 682625_692505
I mean there's one consequence like you were saying &-um the boy shoots a little girl and she dies and that's sort_of a natural consequence . 693605_702705
&-um what other kind of consequences are there that might might be useful to teach morals ? 704625_713425
(0.5) .
just like sitting in a corner . 715525_719885
punishment . 720405_720725
punishment . 721095_721695
yeah so there's there's &-um punishment . 722035_724775
&=writing:board and there's natural consequences . 725415_729315
(0.4) so &-um so basically &-um children are young they're they're being taught that if they do certain things there'll be certain punishments . 730795_744035
&-um and that's because there's underlying morals right ? 744785_751185
that &-um lead us to punish them for doing certain things . 752005_757765
so &~th I mean that's I mean do you think that those are &-um absolute ? 758045_766105
absolutely true ? 766885_769185
the morals and the consequences or do you think that they're somewhat arbitrary and decided by each society each culture separately ? 769905_779445
(0.5) I mean for example I mean we were talking about lots_of different &-um societies today right ? 780825_791885
&-um we talked about the the band tribe chiefdom state typology . 792385_799885
&=writing:board to &-um be very generous and give a_lot_of gifts to the people right ? 819065_825285
whereas he said in a state society people have more freedom to collect goods . 825745_831685
and they don't hafta redistribute them . 831805_833685
so that's sort_of a difference in morals right +..? 834545_837065
I mean so do you think that <there are> there are morals that are absolute or do you think or do you think that all morals are cultural ? 841205_849685
yeah ? 849845_849965
I don't think it's really a difference I think that in bands tribes and chiefdoms they hadta do that to get people to follow (th)em . 850545_857625
and support (th)em . 858065_858845
but if they could've like just kept it all to themselves they would've . 859545_863225
maybe so . 864145_864765
I mean I'm not saying that's not true but it was a it's a standard of that society right ? 865525_869705
yeah . 869845_870025
I think all morals are created . 870485_871705
like if you look at World War Two and you know murder wasn't bad anymore because you were as long as you can like justify your actions you can create any moral . 872025_879945
yeah that's an interesting that's an interesting point of view . 880365_883805
yeah . 884005_884125
I was gonna say that &-uh <I think> I think morals are all the same but I think &-uh different cultures rank the importance of &~dif different morals accordingly . 884505_893105
&-uh just like an example is if you compare Eastern thought with Western thought over any any range of topic it's like Eastern thought is very group oriented you know like you know you you acquiesce <to the> to the person &~a above you or you know someone like like someone <that you> that you should hold more respect for and Western thought's very like individualistic and you know personal rights and all that stuff so . 893665_916405
I &~d I &~th I think morals are basically the same from culture to culture . 916885_919685
but it would depend on the way they rank the importance of each one . 920065_922865
yeah that's a really interesting that's a really interesting way to look at it . 923965_927625
I like that . 927745_928225
I mean yeah basically he said that &-um in some way you can have both you can say that that there are morals which are universal but culture still plays a big role in determining &-um which morals take precedence . 928945_945605
and &-um that's actually something there's a &-um a really famous philosopher who who wrote something very very similar to that so just in case you're interested &-um Alasdair MacIntyre . 946785_960085
I don't know &~jus just to let you know . 960725_962365
but yeah he's he's he's &-um a really well respected philosopher who said something very similar . 962745_966865
yeah . 966985_967105
&-um as for like whether or not there are absolute morals I definitely think that there're are &~neces whether or not they're universal morals is I don't think ever gonna be known or &~whe whether or not they're socially constructed or whatnot but definitely I think like something as extreme as a child killing someone &-um some are more like are more obvious than others . 967945_992025
and haven't been known to like work like certain actions . 993345_997245
yeah that's yeah that's a good point . 997605_999905
I don't think there's any universal morals . 1000325_1001825
&-um you look back in time before like monotheistic religion and they would sacrifice people to God . 1002285_1008465
as long as you believe like you have that faith that I don't know how to put in words really but give me a minute I'll come back to it but &=laughs:multiple as &~lon like I was saying as long as you can justify it it's okay . 1008785_1020385
like I don't think over time there's been no moral that's been completely universal . 1022685_1026705
so what does that mean to justify it ? 1027205_1028725
like how how do we justify ? 1028865_1030285
like you're sacrificing the person for God for like a higher meaning . 1030965_1034325
if it's culturally justified . 1034665_1035925
yeah I think yeah that's +/. 1036345_1037545
+, if society doesn't have a problem with it as a whole then there's no punishment there's no shame in doing it it's common practice so . 1037545_1044605
yeah I think there's a_lot_o(f) truth to that point too . 1046105_1048025
yeah did you wanna say I'm sorry . 1048265_1050245
no never mind . 1050375_1050575
I got your point . 1050575_1051495
it's the second time that happened to you today . 1051615_1053275
&=laughs &-um yeah . 1054035_1055995
I think that's a good point . 1056135_1057015
I think that like has a_lot to do with like looking at other cultures from like your own culture . 1057675_1061955
like like we can look at (th)em and say like that it's a bad thing it's not moral for our like +//. 1062255_1068035
but then they look at and it is moral so so like it's hard to say . 1068955_1073155
like <you can't> you can't like &-um look at other cultures like and whatever say if they're right or wrong then it's like hard to say . 1073165_1082545
yeah I mean that's yeah that's basically that's like cultural relativism which we were talking about a couple weeks ago . 1083145_1091025
definitely becomes important . 1091925_1092805
yeah . 1093205_1093265
and not to stereotype but like some &-uh Gypsy tribes it's &-uh like to steal is how they survive . 1093525_1099885
you know like moving from one place to another and by stealing that's how they get by . 1100225_1103785
it's not amoral to them it's &-uh or immoral to them . 1103965_1106605
⌈ <well they need to> ⌉ .
⌊ I'm sorry wait ⌋ she's I'm gonna give her precedence (be)cause she she always has her point taken away . 1106885_1113045
&=laughs .
&-um about the Gypsy thing but like if it's justified to them but they pay consequences if they're in our society because that's wrong in our society . 1114005_1125165
right <but not> but not within their own . 1125305_1127005
so so that +//. 1127705_1128525
I mean that's a interesting point though because &-um we were talking about consequences and &-um I mean there could be cases where consequences and morals are not related . 1128825_1138585
so &-um and this is something also to think about . 1139645_1143645
<with this> with this typology actually because &-um this is something that I wanted to get to &-um in class today &-um I mean we talk about all these different types of governments right ? 1144465_1155345
but &-um &~a at the bottom line in in the year two thousand <are there> are there really any band tribe or chiefdom governments ? 1155945_1165385
(0.5) I mean the answer's no . 1167185_1171565
&-um every there are bands tribes and chiefdoms but they all live in states . 1172705_1177885
so a &~Gyp Gypsies would be an example of that phenomenon &-um state governments all over the world have have the ultimate power and <they can> they can assert their own consequences and their own morals over these other types of organization which may still exist but <they're not> they're not really governments anymore <in the> in the ultimate sense . 1180065_1204245
in the like the Amazon they still are a little bit . 1204505_1206965
sorry ? 1207345_1207565
like in the Amazon where they really have no contact +/. 1208185_1210385
they've +/.
+, outside the tribes have no ⌈ contact at all ⌉ . 1211845_1214945
⌊ &-um well they do ⌋ +/. 1215045_1215765
⌈ well very little ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I mean that's that's ⌋ I mean that's that's an interesting situation to bring up . 1215905_1220205
I mean they do have contact with with the government at this point . 1220205_1223865
&-um I think this was discussed in your book but &-um maybe even thirty five years ago there would've been tribes that had pretty much autonomy . 1224875_1236915
but but now &-um really they don't . 1238215_1242575
I mean if they wanna to get some kind_of rights &-um you know there's different competing groups say there's miners who wanna go in and and &-um or loggers that wanna go in and use the land the tribes also have something that they wanna do on the land and it's really the state that hasta mediate . 1242975_1259595
<just like> just like Doctor_Kottak was talking about today &-um with how &-um in the on the coast of Peru he was saying the different groups expand they come into conflict and then a larger government forms to mediate and that's sort_of you can look at it the same way there . 1260235_1276755
yeah ? 1277415_1278155
it's kind_of like the situation in Waco . 1278295_1279915
because they thought they were living by they were living by their own rules and stuff in another &~cultu you know in another +/. 1280555_1285675
yeah +/. 1285735_1285935
+, set of consequences so I mean it's kind_of even though their morals are different they still have to pay the consequences of the rest of their surroundings . 1286225_1295105
yeah and that's a really good point and I mean that's I mean in some cases I mean they &~d they &~di they weren't successful and maybe we're glad of that . 1295605_1302605
&~or I mean not that they were treated fairly of_course but maybe we're glad that they didn't &-um you_know weren't able to secede and form their own country or whatever . 1303045_1310565
but I mean that that can be something that ends up having consequences for state governments as a whole . 1310705_1317725
if if &~s groups form that have their own values they can end up challenging and changing the way that the larger society is structured so that's that's another another thing to think about with the whole issue of power and and social control . 1318405_1333205
&-um &~d now we're talking about morals I think morals are really central to this but there's other things there're other types of control besides morals that are exerted on us I think . 1335385_1347025
&-um for example let's say &-um coming to class right ? 1347205_1354145
&-um it's not immoral to cut class . 1354405_1357925
well maybe &~it I mean you could &~ma maybe someone could make an argument like I don't know your parents paid all this money and you made a promise to them to go to class and so it's immoral to cut class . 1357995_1366875
but &-um <let's say> &-uh let's say for the sake of argument you know you paid your own tuition . 1367075_1374695
it's your own choice . 1375575_1376235
&-um but you're still here you came to class . 1376955_1380055
&-um &~ho hopefully part of the reason is because you like coming to class and you're learning something and you're you know . 1380745_1386125
but &-um in some cases maybe not in this class but in some class that you've taken you probably didn't really like it or really get that much out_of it but you still went to class anyway . 1386845_1397305
&-um not because it was immoral not to go but but why ? 1398465_1401405
(0.6) .
the grade . 1407945_1408545
I mean yeah I mean this still gets back to consequences definitely &-um social consequences . 1410075_1415115
&-um and that's one reason . 1417015_1419715
(0.4) do you think that's the only reason ? 1422235_1424495
(0.5) or if you do come to class because you you're getting something out_of it say you're learning something that you wanna learn what is it that what is it that makes you wanna learn these particular things ? 1429745_1444285
how why why have you decided that the kind of things that you can learn by going to class at a university are more worth knowing or more worth spending your time on than say the kind of things you could learn by camping ? 1444505_1457845
yeah . 1458365_1458545
maybe you have like higher aspirations like on &~a like if you have a different if you have like a some kind of goal later in life that you wanna achieve then you can't really achieve that by going camping . 1459145_1468685
yeah I mean that's that's an important I mean that's related to consequences but it's it's separate +... 1469635_1475615
I mean yeah <definitely goals> definitely goals are important . 1477875_1483275
and that's &~wh for a_lot_of people that's that's the reason why they do go to school . 1484395_1488615
what if you &-um I mean there must be someone like this in the class &-um like me when I was &-um your age . 1489275_1496255
what if you really don't know what you wanna do when you graduate from college ? 1496515_1500015
I mean chances are probably that &-um going to college is gonna help you with whatever you end up deciding to do but if you really don't know what you're gonna do how do you know that &-um going to college is a good thing ? 1500375_1515515
I mean this I mean what is it yeah . 1516475_1519495
because you've seen it work for other people +/. 1520175_1521835
⌈ yeah ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ and so ⌋ you . 1523315_1523595
that's true yeah and that's I mean that's &-um that's important that's an important part of socialization is is &-um imitation . 1524065_1532665
and you sort_of have to trust that things will go the same way for you that they go for other people . 1533725_1540285
yeah . 1540585_1540645
it's also not exactly a bad thing to learn new information I mean even if that even if a college education isn't gonna be exactly what you're gonna if it's not gonna take you where you wanna be it's not exactly a bad thing to learn new stuff . 1541115_1555215
yeah that's true &-um definitely . 1555995_1558455
&-um (0.4) but how do you know what kind of what kind of stuff <that you> that you wanna learn +..? 1561585_1570125
&~ho I mean how do you know what kind of stuff is is more important or more valuable ? 1573205_1577365
yeah . 1577605_1577745
you have to experience it all and then you get to to decide after that . 1578005_1580965
I mean <that's definitely> that's definitely <that's definitely> &-um that's definitely true to &~s I mean &~with within some boundaries right though . 1582005_1593805
yeah . 1594945_1595125
I think it's also too to some extent social social conditions social norms like when you're talking about something as broad as college you know . 1595485_1601245
&~i <in our> in our society it's it's the thing that you should do you know you should go to college if you were in high school and you were smart . 1601905_1607665
like if you meet someone and you know they were really smart in high school and then they said yeah I just didn't wanna go to college most of us would think you know what's what's wrong with this person ? 1607875_1616535
and you know in other societies it's like to not go to you know after you graduate from high school it's natural for them just to go into the workplace and they don't think twice about going to college so I think it's also social social norms and that kind of thing . 1617215_1628315
it it can't really &~ap it doesn't really apply to something specific as going to class going like skipping class . 1628495_1633315
but when you're talking about going to college I think it does . 1633745_1636105
yeah <I think that's> &-um I think that's a really good point &-um and let's yeah I mean that's probably a point that's more related to &-um anthropology . 1636605_1647525
&-um but I I mean this isn't seeming like to &-um too much information to you all but I guess what I'm trying to get at by getting you to give me all these different answers is how &-um well first of all social life is really complex . 1648425_1662545
and <there are> &~a there are social norms but then there're also other factors that help people to choose between different social norms and &-um and even factors that influence people to to go outside of social norms . 1663145_1677325
but the social norms are still exist and they still have some kind of interaction with these other factors so by throwing all of these out I I hope that you're starting to think about how these things might fit together . 1677945_1690325
&-um how &~di how do social norms relate to the goals ? 1690985_1695265
I mean this is really just building on what you said but but &-um I mean when we set goals how do we decide what our goals should be ? 1695405_1705065
I mean do you think for example that if someone didn't go to college it means they're gonna be miserable for the rest of their life ? 1705725_1713465
and their life is worthless ? 1714425_1715745
I mean probably not . 1716345_1717645
I hope you don't think that . 1717925_1719045
&=laughs but yet you still set a goal that that that involves going to college so . 1720125_1726485
I mean I think that has something to do with with social norms . 1729065_1731405
(0.5) I mean what does anyone have any any more points on that ? 1732465_1741365
or what kind of yeah ? 1741925_1742665
I mean it just depends what makes you happy . 1742865_1744285
like if I was George Bush's son like the first one ? 1744475_1747975
I probably wouldn't (ha)ve even gone to school . 1748435_1749635
you know I would've had all the money I wouldn't (ha)ve wanted wanted to be a politician . 1749955_1753115
I would've been happy you know ? 1753415_1754275
⌈ get a job from my dad and ⌉ . 1755675_1757235
⌊ well yeah and there's ⌋ &=laughs:multiple <there's another> there's another question . 1757235_1759375
this is a really good a really good point that you bring up . 1759655_1762695
&-um I mean we say that and maybe you would I mean I'm not saying you wouldn't but &-um there's lots_of people in the world take Bill Gates you know for an example who &-um make lots_of money have lots_of money or other people who inherit lots_of money . 1763665_1778905
they don't hafta work but they do . 1779605_1782385
it makes (th)em happy . 1783225_1783845
why does it make them happy ? 1784585_1785885
gives their lives gives their life like self-worth I don't know . 1786385_1790325
well you need something to do . 1790565_1791445
you go crazy when you like stagnate and have nothing to do . 1791545_1794185
I think that's that's I mean <there's definitely> &-um there's definitely some truth to this I mean I'm not saying you're wrong but on the other hand think about &-um did you ever read &-um any novels by Jane Austin say or see any of the movies ? 1795205_1812525
like what ?
+, &-um I mean those people didn't do &=laughs do anything . 1813365_1816745
right ? 1817405_1817505
I mean they they &-um they play the piano and draw a little bit and write a letter and go out for a walk and it didn't seem to bother them I mean &~th having lots_of money to them basically meant they didn't have to do anything and they were happy about it right ? 1818165_1833385
so why is it that &-um that we don't ? 1833725_1836885
yeah . 1837025_1837145
it like maybe it was a little more socially accepted in that time period . 1837765_1840665
it seems now everybody if you're not doing something then people really question why you're not doing anything since everybody's so busy and there's ⌈ it's just ⌉ . 1841145_1849245
⌊ yeah I ⌋ think that's yeah I mean that's that's what I would say . 1849545_1852045
yeah ? 1852665_1852685
even doing that gives you something to do it's just in a different context . 1852885_1856125
it's &~jus people need like some sense of accomplishment like in their lives to know that they're doing something I mean &~o obviously it'd be great if it's always you know for a worthy cause but even just playing the piano can give yourself some &~sa &~self &~satis you know &~faction that you can maybe you know show it to other people or you know bring it to other areas . 1856885_1876145
I mean I think that's true that people I mean they are always doing something definitely and that's an important point . 1877305_1882005
but I mean I just wanna emphasize that that we we've gotten back again <to the> &-um to the social norms . 1882345_1888385
I mean in our society there's a a norm that says people should be doing something all the time . 1888565_1894805
&-um what's wrong with you if you're not doing something ? 1895945_1898225
&-um in that society well people still I mean it wasn't you know they didn't sit in a chair and stare at the wall all day but but &-um there was a different definition of what it means to have a sense of accomplishment or what it means to do something . 1898905_1912265
so &-um that's that's another way that &-um that culture sort_of determines +... 1913825_1921225
in a way or helps to determine I should say . 1923185_1926045
what what we do . 1926505_1927945
so I mean +... 1929645_1930025
why do we why do we have these beliefs in social norms ? 1930465_1936265
I mean what do you think ? 1936825_1937705
how did we get this idea that we should be doing something all the time ? 1938005_1941345
(0.4) or how did we get this idea that &-um or how do you get an idea that you should go to college even though maybe some other people ? 1942405_1951785
yeah . 1954305_1954525
I think a_lot_of it gets relayed through like your parents . 1954785_1956985
like I know my parents have a strong push for education it always comes first . 1958145_1962125
whereas like in school you could always see like the people whose parents didn't push as hard and then &~i &~i like it's really up to the child and they don't care so much . 1962945_1970325
but then there's the people whose parents don't care and then they care a_lot . 1971065_1973425
definitely . 1974085_1975265
I mean I think it definitely has a_lot to do with with your parents . 1975585_1978765
&-um I mean some things you know are really different for <different parents> &~i different parents emphasize different kind_of goals and some things &-um that maybe all parents within a certain society all share so that's that's really important yeah . 1979905_1996025
I think a_lot_of it also hasta &-uh do with what you choose to sort_of like latch onto like whether it's your parents or what you see on TV and it's sort_of all &-um developed as you get older and like sometimes for people it's like gangs they see you know ? 1996765_2012945
and &~th you know that's you sorta start to form those things . 2013745_2019705
yeah +/.
+, or at least use that as your starting point . 2020865_2022565
I don't know .
yeah and I mean that's that's a really important way of putting it too that that &-um within the category that you could call social norms there's all these different one second there's all these different choices that that people could make they can choose to follow their parents they can choose to follow TV which is still setting up another kind_of norm in a way . 2024475_2044535
because when you watch TV . 2045055_2045935
I mean think about this next time that you watch TV (be)cause (be)cause I think you'll &-um you'll notice &-um a_lot_of shows have some kind of moral lesson or <some kind of> &-um some kind of values that they're promoting either you know crime is bad or &-um family harmony is good or &-um something about love and relationships or there's all different of societal norms that you could see really explicitly in TV programs . 2046605_2076285
and then there's also the peers . 2077465_2079065
<which our> which our society &-um you know sometimes perhaps <if it's> if it's gangs maybe it's not the most &-um healthy or productive way to &-um kind_of society part of our society you could argue . 2079705_2097525
but still &-um peers and kind of peer pressure &-um is a kind of social norm . 2097865_2104845
and I mean especially <in a> in a really big society like ours <in a> in a state society &-um there are different there are different factors and different choices that &-um you know in a band maybe there wouldn't be quite as many &-um but there're different influences that can come in . 2105385_2127225
did you have something to say ? 2128065_2128765
&-uh I was gonna say that you_know social norm is such a broad category . 2129385_2132485
you_know it covers shaking hands you_know as_well_as like I don't know helping helping an old lady across the street or something . 2133005_2139105
but I think in &-uh <in industrialized> in industrialized nations the state plays a really large part in monitoring or at least tweaking social norms <to their> you_know to their preference so that it's it <it all> it all plays together to help the state function most effectively . 2139385_2156025
yeah I mean that's that's a really interesting point . 2156725_2159325
and <a_lot_of people> a_lot_of people do say that that the state &-um I mean the state definitely has an interest right ? 2159825_2167625
in in &-um in keeping society ordered . 2167805_2171005
&-um in making sure that people fill different tasks in society you know if no one &-um wanted to work at McDonald's then no one could ever eat there for example . 2172025_2183205
&-um so the state definitely has &~it has an interest in promoting certain kinds of norms . 2183865_2192125
but how does I mean and this is a really you know it's kind_of almost a philosophical question so I don't expect you all to be able to answer it right now but &-um how does how do these norms get from the state or from some body of government to the people ? 2193225_2211025
<how does> how does the state control people ? 2211615_2215195
I mean it's yeah . 2217595_2218435
I_mean just in every every connection that the state has with you_know in in terms of politicians' speeches in their censorship of the media &-um you_know in in their dealings with with &-uh with religious leaders . 2218635_2231155
and and I_mean <there's so many> there's so much literature on you_know how religion is just +//. 2231515_2236155
it's I forget the what the quote is but it's &-uh <it's a> it's a it's a <pill for the> &~p pill for the people ⌈ thing I think it's by Marx . 2236465_2241805
by Marx ⌉ ?
⌊ oh yeah I mean there's &-um ⌋ well yeah this is &-um that's Marx Marx who said that &-um . 2241805_2247745
religion is the &-uh ⌈ is the either of the &~p opiate of the people . 2247745_2252045
yeah opium ⌉ .
⌊ &-um opium opiate of the masses ⌋ yeah . 2252125_2253425
&=writing:board yeah . 2254085_2263985
I mean that's and so that's I mean that's a &-um that's another another whole I should put it up here too . 2264315_2271155
&-um that's another whole area . 2272075_2274175
where norms can come from . 2275135_2276335
religion . 2276535_2276755
and &-um I mean what is the connection between state and religion <that's another> that's another kind_of interesting topic because &-um as you probably all are thinking right now &-um we have the idea of separation of church and state in the United States . 2277495_2295595
so there's there's &~an a belief an attempt that that these two things should be separate but in some sense they're not . 2296955_2303355
&-um I remember &-um when I went to to &-um Taiwan for some reason that was the first time that I I realized this &-um that all of our government offices closed on Christmas . 2304495_2319915
they don't close on any other &-um religious holidays of other religions but they always close on Christmas . 2320575_2326115
&-um so that's already something . 2327095_2329835
it's not huge but I mean some kind of an acknowledgment that the state gives preferential treatment to certain religions over others . 2330475_2341835
&-um not that I'm saying necessarily that they shouldn't do that . 2342015_2344895
I think it's almost impossible to completely separate &-um &~s church from state . 2345295_2350675
&-um yeah . 2351575_2352155
yeah I was just gonna say I mean &~i it's all you have to do is just look at the Republican party and you can see very well that religion and state are definitely not separated you know like there's such a huge &~co Christian coalition and +/. 2352235_2364215
that's true +/. 2364435_2365115
+, and all that +/. 2365195_2365615
+, ⌈ yeah and there's ⌉ +/. 2366095_2366675
+, ⌊ you know like who ⌋ who's making the laws ? 2366695_2367275
it's it's people that are religious so +/. 2367515_2369155
+, yeah +/.
+, it's impossible to separate religion and state really . 2369355_2371955
and look at the constitution you know all men created under under God . 2372155_2376395
religion is a belief in God . 2376755_2377915
not everyone believed in in God &~s you know so you can't I mean even starting from that point it was botched . 2377945_2383945
well that's true I mean religious people are making the laws you know they're gonna follow their convictions they would be unethical not to follow their convictions . 2384765_2392445
&-um that's that's certainly true . 2393545_2394625
&-um yeah it's it's I mean if if we're talking about morals &-um I mean that hasta be always connected to religion . 2395545_2408065
definitely . 2409905_2410125
(0.5) does I mean does anyone wanna stand up for the separation of church and state ? 2411785_2419645
yeah . 2420385_2420845
&-um I &~wa I definitely think though that &-um I'm not I don't know like how far we've come but a_lot_o(f) people have this notion that it should either happen overnight or that it should never happen and rather than believing that it can happen gradually . 2421265_2434305
and something like church and state I mean as connected as they still might be I mean not necessarily as much and you know again when people &~ha think that it should just happen like that you know usually the consequences are negative . 2434745_2450005
and you know ⌈ because the ⌉ . 2450885_2453005
⌊ well that's ⌋ yeah I mean that's a good point . 2453005_2454385
I_mean when people try to suddenly separate church from state when they had been really connected can have lots_of problems . 2454545_2462485
&-um like I don't know if you've all &~f been following &-um what <goes what's> goes on in Turkey . 2462825_2467645
I_mean I haven't followed it as much as I'd like to . 2467845_2470925
but &-um you might remember last year there was a a woman who &-um who was wearing a head scarf and in the legislature and they &-um kicked her out_of the legislature for doing that . 2471065_2484785
&-um I mean that wouldn't happen in the United States because we have this idea of freedom of religion . 2485785_2491245
&-um so we'd say that people should be able to follow their religion &-um and that shouldn't prevent them from holding government offices . 2492145_2500765
but in Turkey they're I mean they had a really &-um religious government the government was the religion it was all tied together completely tied together and they're just trying to rip it apart in this kind of radical way within the last say one hundred years and so it's led to these kind of really &-um harsh laws to try to separate it out . 2502265_2527225
so <that's a> &-um that's a interesting point . 2527465_2530885
but then I mean on the other hand you could say that &-um I mean are we moving towards separating church and state ? 2531985_2539385
I don't know . 2539565_2540165
&-um all the candidates and there's been some a_lot_of talk in the newspapers about how all the candidates have to talk about their religious beliefs as part of their campaigns in the current election . 2541305_2551485
&-um that might be more true now than it was I don't know eight years ago or whatever +... 2552425_2559645
yeah . 2560945_2562925
well my my understanding of the constitution it says separation of &~ch church from the state but it doesn't mean that the religion can't have a say in the state because the whole meaning of that was that the state couldn't overtake religion like they were doing in Great Britain . 2563205_2578345
so there's no way that you can sit there and say +//. 2578745_2581105
you know you can't bring your religious beliefs into politics because it's a part of your everyday life and then that'd be crossing your constitutional right of freedom of religion . 2581405_2589525
so I think if a candidate wants to tell their religious belief I say go for it . 2589845_2594825
I mean but I I totally disagree with the whole &~s &~m the state and the religion can't be intermixed because the whole purpose of that was that the state couldn't tell people about their religious beliefs ⌈ not that religion is <different from> the state ⌉ . 2595085_2608445
⌊ I mean I think ⌋ I mean the the answer that I would give to that just you know devil's advocate or whatever is that maybe &~th maybe the arrow hasta be two way if there's a connection at all . 2608445_2621945
because if &-um if someone brings their religious beliefs into politics say and &~en enacts laws based on their religious beliefs and other people have different beliefs you know that are totally completely different then somehow the first person's beliefs are infringing on the second person . 2622515_2641015
<you could> you could say . 2642635_2643595
I mean or not . 2644795_2646415
just to throw out an argument . 2647195_2648195
but I know &~i I think I mean I think that just because you know I could make that argument doesn't mean that that what you're saying is not true . 2650185_2656045
because &-um all of these things could be ideals that we could be we could try to separate the two doesn't mean necessarily that we'll have to succeed completely in separating them in order for it to be worth trying at all . 2656345_2671705
so that's that's still a valid point . 2671925_2674265
&-um oh one more thing I wanted to say about about this typology . 2675505_2679765
&-um Doctor_Kottak said that there &-um in the band tribe and chiefdom there's there's a kinship principle right ? 2680725_2687165
&-um that there's there's some kind of &-um biological relationship between the people . 2687985_2693905
&-um well of_course it's not really biological . 2695005_2697965
because that's a western concept but there's some kind of relationship by marriage and birth . 2698675_2707335
&-um between the people living in in these kind of societies . 2708275_2710955
whereas in the state society well in our state society there isn't right ? 2711655_2716495
I mean there's people from all over the world that come to America and they're all citizens of the state . 2716615_2721795
but &-um is that always true ? 2722035_2725095
I mean &~i can there be a kinship principle of any kind in a state society ? 2727005_2731825
(0.6) I mean I think this is a really interesting sort_of dilemma for a_lot_of states . 2734725_2742585
&-um because I mean America's kind_of different because we have this whole ideology that &-um we're a country of immigrants but &-um I mean many states have &~in a different kind of ideology which which hasta do with ethnicity . 2743265_2763725
so take Germany for example since that's a kind_of a extreme example maybe &-um there's an idea in Germany that there's something called German ethnicity right ? 2764785_2776005
and somehow having German ethnicity &-um has something to do with living in Germany . 2776465_2783745
in some kind_of a way . 2784305_2785645
&-um &~i I mean it's this principle that basically was behind the idea that East Germany and West Germany should be one country right ? 2786515_2794455
&-um they're two separate countries but they're all German so they should all be one country so we should bring the two of them together . 2795195_2802535
&-um at the same time there's a_lot_of immigrants in Germany as well . 2802755_2807535
and &-um there was some debate over I mean now immigrants to Germany can can have citizenship but that's a really recent change . 2808875_2820195
&-um up until about two years ago &-um there were <different kinds of> &~ci different kinds of citizenship for people who were German and people who were not ethnically German . 2821135_2833395
because there is an idea that that you know to be German . 2834215_2837115
&-um I mean in the end it comes I mean to me like it sounds to me like it comes down to a kinship principle a_lot like you find in a band a tribe or a chiefdom . 2838075_2847875
that basically what you're saying when you're saying people have you know an ethnicity like they're all I mean it doesn't just hafta be Germany &-um that's just a good example . 2848135_2858755
but I mean every country in Europe &-um and most countries in the world actually not every country but most countries have some kind of idea of what it means to be really from that country and it hasta do with ethnicity . 2858865_2875205
and ethnicity you know is some kind of idea about blood and relatedness . 2876245_2881105
and we're all the same in some kind of biological cultural way that ties us together . 2881465_2888165
so &-um it's not a kinship where I could trace my kinship or &-um tell you exactly you know everyone in this country is my cousin or something like that but in a way it's still not as different from the way that these other &-um kinds of governments organize themselves as as we might originally think so I just wanted to throw that out . 2889785_2914305
okay give me all your papers and &-um if you have any questions +... 2914595_2919895
and please if yeah if you don't if there's anything that you said in class that you don't want to be used by this linguistics project talk to Janine . 2923335_2931695
&-um you got my I got your email back so &~wha what was that all about ? 2933215_2939275
&~wha I'm sorry what ? 2939275_2940975
it was about like that you didn't have my final exam .
oh yeah no I'm sorry about that yeah . 2942545_2944005
I just <I was> &-um I was confused I think it was . 2944285_2947685
that's okay <somebody else> .
yeah .
but I found it so it's no problem . 2948065_2950525
okay good . 2950545_2951165
&=laughs .
I have a question really quick I just wanna know if this is like a fault like I was having problems with like costs of like a foraging society +/. 2951485_2957705
uhuh +/.
+, (be)cause they didn't really show any in the movie . 2957905_2959125
yeah . 2959685_2959985
and like the book doesn't really touch on it all that much like it talks about <farming society> so like I said like a cost was that they can't support all the people and they can be pushed out of like they talked about it in like <Schultz and Nower> talked about it is that like one human lifetime something is past that +/. 2960065_2975365
oh right .
+, like +/.
+, they didn't have it +/. 2976405_2977045
+, like foraging societies can't survive in certain areas +/. 2977045_2979725
+, yeah +/. 2980145_2980345
+, they get pushed there like .
that's a good that's a good point . 2981305_2982425
okay okay I just wanted to make sure . 2982825_2983805
alright cool . 2984085_2984465
hi . 2985365_2985585
I have a question .
do you think there'll ever be a fifth category ? 2988205_2988545
oh that's a good question . 2988545_2990105
like (be)cause you know how you said that there's ethnicity based states do you think they'll ever eventually because the world seems to be going towards a interconnected kinda general like you can be an American but there's no like you're not it's not like you're German . 2990465_3004685
you know you're American but you're of Italian descent . 3005365_3007145
yeah +/.
+, do you think there'll ever be a differentiation between that type of state and like America ? 3007745_3012865
&-um well I mean I guess you could say that there is in a way because I mean this is just like a way of classifying +/. 3013625_3019025
right +/.
+, things so you could just classify it differently . 3019325_3020645
⌈ but yeah there could be years ⌉ .
⌊ I just wondered if &-um like years down the road if it's ⌋ if it comes to the point where there's no more real ethnicity based things if they'll take it out_of the the state system ⌈ and call it something else ⌉ . 3020685_3030725
⌊ <I think> I think that could easily ⌋ happen . 3030725_3032545
and also the other thing that people talk about I don't know if this is you know true or not but they say that the whole state system could &-um be moving towards ending because the you know transportation and communication being so much better that &-um being bound to one in particular I mean states are basically based on land +/. 3032665_3051005
right +/.
+, so &-um but if you could just you know take an airplane and be somewhere else or get on the internet you know where you actually live becomes less and less important +/. 3051945_3060625
+, right +/.
+, so +/.
+, ⌈ so xxx ⌉ +/. 3060785_3061225
+, ⌊ I mean ⌋ that could be another thing that would +/. 3061845_3063465
+, yeah +/.
+, you know change the .
that's really interesting we'll have to see .
probably won't happen in this lifetime . 3065145_3069905
I don't think so not too soon anyway but we'll see I mean you know . 3070065_3072845
no it's a slow process . 3072985_3073985
it is . 3074045_3074345
