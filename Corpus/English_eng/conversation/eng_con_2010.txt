That 's it Sixty two pounds twenty five Okay Now if they had a
Thirteen thirty five . 558163_558673
Thirteen thirty five . 560373_562093
For each child . 563233_564163

Leave it to the Citizen 's Advice Bureau . 782533_785433
Yeah Leave it to the Citizen 's Advice Bureau or the D S S . 785443_788623

Mm . 816783_816933
Which I would find very trying if I was in the D S S quite honestly
Yeah . 821133_821193
Right Now so having issued B one where 's it got to go . 821423_832583
The D S S . 832583_833083
Right So it goes to the D S S Which one . 834473_837123
The one nearest . 837123_837853
The one in the area which in they live . 837853_842203
So it it 's not specifically related to the benefit office where
0 .
There was a list of the D S S offices together with guidance on
0 .
I was just wondering that . 924133_939403
0 .
Or is it it is in fact North Radstock is n't it The actual town is
0 .
Okay Any question so far . 949863_968433
0 .
Okay Right so when do you issue a B one . 968433_980163
At fresh claims Change of circumstances . 980163_983843
Fresh claims . 984273_984653
Fresh claims Er what do you mean by change of circumstances . 984693_993293
If they change their address or something or they live with
Yeah Erm change of let's say person 's circumstances It might be
Also when they run out of U B . 1014683_1017903
When they run out of U B Yes Any other times when you might issue
If in doubt . 1098583_1100853
Yes . 1101153_1101393
always give a B one in my opinion . 1103233_1105663
Yes That 's right They may the only thing is they may not wish to
0 .
If a person refuses U B They should take you should issue them with
Sorry Refuses U B . 1133213_1134053
Issues refuses I S . 1135203_1136653
Mhm . 1136653_1136803
You should issue them with the basic leaflet telling them about I S
Mhm . 1139623_1139713
So that they 're aware of what they 've refused . 1139983_1142723
That 's a very good er very good precaution to take yes Very good
0 .
I do n't normally But you can do Well yes you can but if anyone
So before we issue before we hand over the B one what do we do . 1167963_1174433
Fill in the back . 1174433_1174823
We fill in the back Yes We 'll be giving you some exercises later
Who would do this then I mean it would n't just be anyone
No no it does n't have to be an E O Right Erm the only thing is
every day It happens every day Every day . 1215933_1217953
And yes And and so then they they 're a bit miffed that instead of
And the D S S ca n't issue B ones unless they 've gone
That 's right In fact D S S do n't issue B ones . 1243343_1246123
0 .
We we have to issue B ones . 1246133_1254533
0 .
Because they have new people on the counter and it 's it 's . 1256063_1259793
0 .
Good question . 1259793_1259953
It happens every single day Go down and get a B one . 1260153_1267123
How long does it take for income support to come through Once a
According to the managers five and a half days in this area
How long is a piece of string Five and a half days . 1281073_1283223
They can get it immediately get it immediately . 1283613_1284943
0 .
That 's what I was quoted last week . 1284943_1289893
Right . 1291493_1291593
When I asked the self-same question He said five and a half
The last time . 1298383_1298833
I I would I would have thought it could have could take it could
Yeah Two weeks . 1302393_1303233
Two weeks . 1303233_1305033
When they had problems not so long ago it was taking a month . 1305033_1307463
Yeah I heard it was six weeks . 1307463_1308293
A month six weeks . 1308293_1309903
Well they have targets like we all have and one of their
Mm . 1321803_1321893
What does a claimant do then they 've got no money then for
Come and bang on our door for six weeks . 1325473_1328773
They get I think they can . 1328773_1329863
Yeah . 1329863_1329973
They can get a crisis loan They do n't they can also get paid early
But is it up to them to actually go to D S S and say I want
0 .
That 's right So if you get someone in that situation who 's saying
But may but not nec . 1370263_1371503
May . 1373863_1374053
May not . 1374433_1375203
Yeah It depends on the circumstances and you 're not you 're not in
0 .
under er I think they would do under most circumstances It would
B two . 1410153_1410583
Yep B two Right Before I ask you to complete B one there 's one
Suspended . 1436773_1437063
Suspended pending enquiries . 1437063_1437603
Yeah . 1437603_1437823
But not it 's suspended it 's suspended but it 's not disallowed .
That 's right So what what 's the difference . 1445213_1448673
Well it 's suspended pending enquiries so it 's in suspension They
Right But when when the adjudication officer has made a decision he
And then they can appeal . 1479323_1480193
And then they can appeal . 1480193_1480813
If they wish . 1483153_1483503
Yeah . 1483503_1483593
It used to be six months did n't it and now it 's gone up
That 's right yes . 1488203_1488533
Big jump is n't it . 1488893_1489753
Well It went up in stages . 1489823_1492473
Oh did it . 1492593_1492993
It went to thirteen weeks and then it went to twenty six weeks . 1492993_1494873

Yeah . 1496193_1496343
As a deterrent Which it never has had any effect on at all That was
So if they immediately fall back on is I mean it . 1508753_1513003
0 .
Yeah that 's just what I was going to say What happens then to
Paid at a reduced rate . 1518803_1520463
It 's paid at a reduced rate for the period of the suspension . 1521133_1529813
I thought if it 's disqualifying if you were disqualified
No . 1536873_1536963
Sorry it 's it 's if it 's allowed they would have a reason income
And would they still get the income support after that but
Right Once we 're out of the twenty six week period it would go
I think we 're talking about once the suspension was over .
Yeah . 1569233_1569333
and the adj the A O has made the decision disallowed . 1569463_1573503
Mhm . 1573503_1573593
