&=exhale . 345210_346000
eh eh and the wind was in the sail and . 345290_347770
&=breath . 346440_346800
what is the difference between a Sunfish and a sail- what is a
it's a little sailboat . 352460_353390
really scrawny one . 353980_355130
oh . 354260_354580
how many people fit . 355710_356410
about one and a half . 357480_359180
&=exhale . 359140_359760
one person can sit comfortably the other person can be . 360620_363250
scrunched up and then if you want you can stuff a third person in .
oh . 364650_364910
which we did . 366930_367450
ooh . 367810_368070
and she sits like on the wrong side . 367910_369580
&=laughs . 369680_370460
with the boat leans over they just fall out . 370270_372500
&=laughs . 373240_374120
and well it has . 374010_374960
and . 375480_375690
big boats you know they usually have two sails or more . 376020_378390
yeah . 378720_379040
well a Sunfish is . 378950_379920
it's really small and it has one sail . 380500_382180
and it's really light . 382920_384280
um I mean the sail was big . 385720_387680
in proportion to the little tiny rest of the boat . 387890_390550
yeah . 390590_391050
so it goes really fast it's like . 390960_392890
and that . 393470_393740
and you know it can only carry two or three people as I told you .
and it's it's fun . 398480_399760
&=exhale . 400040_400730
