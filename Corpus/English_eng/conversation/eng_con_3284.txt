okay . 0_540
so write three a@l twos for me . 540_2685
three a@l twos . 2685_4571
oh . 4571_4906
(be)cause isn't that don't you have a@l squared three times ? 4906_7611
oh, I get it . 7611_8378
no . 8378_8628
write three a@l twos out . 8628_9651
three a@l twos . 9651_11436
isn't this a@l two a@l squared times a@l squared times a@l squared ? 11436_17931
oh . 17931_18210
oh . 18210_18450
so this is wrong ? 18450_19026
you have a@l squared, a@l squared, like that ? 19026_23346
okay . 23346_23611
now can you break those down further ? 23611_25113
so it's a@l six . 25113_33058
okay . 33058_33485
and redo these . 33485_34251
you guys, okay with the same logic and see if you see a pattern . 34251_37426
okay, Misses Scott ? 37426_38956
yes . 38956_39473
it's a@l to the sixth power . 39473_40795
I don't understand that . 40795_43091
I don't +... 43091_43531
okay . 43531_43906
so break those down . 43906_44345
what's a@l cubed look like ? 44345_44945
that, I don't know . 44945_46858
what's a@l cubed look like ? 46858_49635
how do you write a@l cubed in expanded form ? 49635_51753
how many A's is it ? 51753_53098
three . 53098_53643
so write a@l times a@l times a@l . 53643_56410
okay . 56410_59621
and then what do you have here ? 59621_60748
another a@l cubed . 60748_61535
so what do you write ? 61535_62310
another ? 62310_62916
where did you get another ? 62916_64276
there's a@l cubed times a@l cubed . 64276_65860
I was just reading your paper . 65860_66575
oh, well +... 66575_67445
that's right . 67445_68270
oh . 68270_69628
so write out another a@l cubed . 69628_71760
another a@l cubed . 71760_72578
break it out . 72578_73130
oh, we have to keep going ? 73130_75178
so we can't just stop right there . 75178_77546
so how many A's do you have ? 77546_78290
well, how what about the two ? 78290_79483
where did we get the two from ? 79483_80818
look it . 80818_81498
what's being squared ? 81498_82691
a@l to the three . 82691_83761
yeah . 83761_84305
so a@l three times a@l three, is that +... 84305_85528
oh, twice . 85528_85805
huh ? 85805_86530
yeah . 86530_87266
now you're breaking these down, a@l times a@l times a@l . 87266_90193
so how many A's do you have ? 90193_91336
six . 91336_92321
there you go . 92321_92896
okay . 92896_93816
do we really have to break them down the whole way ? 93816_96146
mm hmm . 96146_96816
(be)cause if you can pick it up, yes . 96816_98576
okay . 98576_99336
let's look at number four . 99336_101616
okay . 101616_109155
are we all focused ? 109155_109751
let's go . 109751_110198
yeah . 110198_110918
number four . 110918_111633
what did you get, Lucia, in your group ? 111633_113065
xxx . 113065_115321
no . 115321_115815
I just want to know what the answer to number four is . 115815_117568
a@l to the sixth . 117568_119503
a@l to the sixth . 119503_120263
okay . 120263_120750
now what did you get over here, Phoebe, for number five ? 120750_122998
a@l to the sixth . 122998_123975
and Robert's group, what did you get for number six ? 123975_126748
a@l to the eighth . 126748_127581
a@l to the eighth . 127581_128645
okay . 128645_129181
did someone find a rule ? 129181_130789
I know . 130789_131240
I know . 131240_131655
I know . 131655_132025
chris, what did you find out ? 132025_132943
a@l to the m@l times n@l, or a@l to the m@l n@l . 132943_136510
okay . 136510_137006
when we have an exponent within parentheses raised to an exponent, we get a@l to the what ? 137006_145956
a@l to the m@l times n@l, or a@l to the m@l n@l . 145956_149375
a@l to the m@l times n@l . 149375_150830
so he's saying, his rule is that you're going to multiply the exponents . 150830_156390
does that work ? 156390_157636
a@l squared cubed, two times three is six . 157636_161035
right ? 161035_161396
mm hmm . 161396_161938
and if we look at number six, two times four is eight . 161938_164723
okay . 164723_165538
so now you've got two rules already down . 165538_167091
you've discovered them all by yourself . 167091_168961
I didn't have to tell you them . 168961_170138
right ? 170138_170586
you found that when you multiply exponents that have the same base, we're gonna add them . 170586_176195
then when we take an exponent and raise it to a power, we're gonna multiply those exponents . 176195_184281
okay . 184281_184668
let's look at the third section . 184668_186745
okay . 186745_187873
now we have two terms within the parentheses being raised to a power . 187873_193153
okay . 193153_194138
expand that out just like I did down here . 194138_197865
two X, we went two X times two X, and then we grouped our like terms, two times two, we got two squared times X squared . 197865_206393
okay . 206393_207040
do that with seven, eight, and nine and see if you can come up with the rule . 207040_211553
we we're having trouble with the update for R T a@l xxx . 211553_226618
I'm trying to work something xxx . 226618_228638
then we'll let them know (be)cause I've I already got +... 228638_242601
miss ? 242601_243331
and then a@l five times a@l five . 243331_249940
and then a@l four times a@l four . 249940_250331
okay . 250331_250558
you just put the exponent after the number . 250558_250915
you don't you don't need to get in get in on it . 250915_253651
just let it let them go . 253651_254155
okay . 254155_254595
so if we did this, could a@l three times a@l three will be the same as a@l b@l three . 254595_259851
right ? 259851_260481
I don't know . 260481_261875
write that down, what you said you think it is . 261875_264068
what ? 264068_265388
okay . 265388_266506
that's a@l cubed times b@l cubed . 266506_268298
right ? 268298_268641
a@l, a@l, a@l, times b@l, b@l, b@l . 268641_272363
okay . 272363_272668
so you asked me is it the same as what ? 272668_275275
a@l b@l . 275275_276035
okay . 276035_277601
so, it would be a@l b@l times a@l b@l times a@l b@l xxx . 277601_282521
wanna ask her like how do you combine it . 282521_284890
how do you combine it ? 284890_285251
okay . 285251_285688
those aren't the same . 285688_286375
yeah they're the same . 286375_287233
how many a@l do I have ? 287233_287873
three and three . 287873_289446
okay . 289446_289791
so I'm okay . 289791_290491
but you I though you asked me is it the same as this . 290491_294088
a@l b@l cubed . 294088_295335
is it ? 295335_296768
it is ? 296768_297781
no . 297781_298445
that says to me a@l times b@l times b@l times b@l . 298445_300928
a@l three, b@l three . 300928_307390
that's that's what you have to make sure . 307390_309535
okay . 309535_309973
(be)cause this is when you asked me +... 309973_311168
right . 311168_312440
I told you . 312440_312948
that's what it sounded like you had asked . 312948_313798
and that's not the same as that . 313798_315046
and you understand why . 315046_315718
right ? 315718_316135
okay . 316135_316598
yes ? 316598_317101
so this would be right, and xxx . 317101_318771
uh huh . 318771_319860
okay . 319860_320708
try to develop your rule if you can, too, with your group ? 320708_324365
how do you keep you just combine them . 324365_327925
right ? 327925_328253
okay . 328253_329165
well, think about this . 329165_330901
this is you have a@l b@l cubed . 330901_332773
if I were to expand this okay, if I was going to expand that, that would be a@l times b@l times b@l times b@l . 332773_340835
is that the problem I gave you ? 340835_342523
no . 342523_343931
okay . 343931_344691
so find out where you went wrong with this logic . 344691_347963
I don't see you writing this out in expanded form . 347963_350435
all right . 350435_350938
okay ? 350938_351371
yes ? 351371_354110
am I doing this right ? 354110_354900
yes . 354900_356731
oh . 356731_357346
miss xxx ? 357346_358058
yes . 358058_358836
I told you, brat . 358836_359611
I don't understand the next step . 359611_360756
okay . 360756_361363
so far I xxx a@l times b@l so that'd be a@l b@l . 361363_365210
okay . 365210_365468
and then it's <times three> . 365468_367368
<three times> . 367368_367730
yeah . 367730_368208
so a@l times a@l b@l, a@l b@l, a@l b@l . 368208_370193
what do I do next ? 370193_370690
okay . 370690_371018
so how many a@l do you have ? 371018_371761
three a@l and three b@l . 371761_373138
three a@l . 373138_373435
and three b@l . 373435_373745
okay . 373745_374336
so what does this say ? 374336_376288
that says one a@l and three b@l . 376288_377530
is this right ? 377530_377896
oh . 377896_378496
one a@l and three b@l ? 378496_378930
doesn't that what that says ? 378930_381001
where ? 381001_381758
right here . 381758_382401
doesn't that say one a@l ? 382401_383888
a@l to the one times b@l to the three ? 383888_386318
that's not what I have . 386318_387488
I have this . 387488_388316
oh, what ? 388316_388851
is it a@l cubed ? 388851_389646
well, would it be like +... 389646_390845
so I don't know . 390845_391183
how many a@l do you have ? 391183_392051
three . 392051_392516
three . 392516_392735
so what's what's +... 392735_394228
a@l cubed . 394228_395341
a@l cubed times xxx ? 395341_397621
a@l cubed times a@l cubed ? 397621_398365
and that's that's +... 398365_400456
so then I was right ? 400456_401048
yeah . 401048_401863
oh . 401863_402190
cool . 402190_402965
so a@l b@l times to the third isn't right ? 402965_405173
would it be xxx or would it be times that ? 405173_407080
is that right, Miss Scott ? 407080_408556
that's that's fine . 408556_409215
a@l cubed times b@l cubed . 409215_410775
uhhuh . 410775_411381
so a@l cubed times +... 411381_413623
and and then if you can get rid of the multiplication it can just be a@l cubed, b@l cubed . 413623_418705
can't it ? 418705_419173
sure . 419173_420981
okay . 420981_422245
yes, Phoebe ? 422245_429461
okay . 429461_430238
I don't okay, for number seven, wouldn't it equal, like wouldn't you put in for instance a@l times a@l times a@l . 430238_436703
and then other times you'd put it b@l times b@l times b@l ? 436703_439365
okay . 439365_439746
and what that would equal what ? 439746_441186
write it as powers . 441186_442413
how many a@l do you have ? 442413_443803
a@l or a@l cubed . 443803_445741
okay . 445741_446163
times what ? 446163_447493
times b@l cubed . 447493_448725
so would that be the answer or would I put a@l b@l cubed ? 448725_451428
okay . 451428_453036
write a@l b@l cubed for me . 453036_455005
five times and then times b@l, times b@l, times b@l . 455005_458636
okay . 458636_458903
how many a@l is that ? 458903_459556
three . 459556_460116
is it ? 460116_460850
where's the three on the a@l ? 460850_462113
oh . 462113_462668
oh . 462668_463115
so you'd have to put a@l cubed plus b@l cubed ? 463115_465906
are we did I tell you to plus ? 465906_468620
no . 468620_469186
what are we doing ? 469186_469915
times . 469915_471258
multiplying . 471258_471586
okay . 471586_471995
and how do we designate multiplying in algebra ? 471995_475786
parentheses . 475786_476386
and what other way ? 476386_477308
and the little dot thing . 477308_479210
and what other way ? 479210_479901
times, the x@l . 479901_482538
the x@l . 482538_483090
and what other way ? 483090_483650
I don't know . 483650_484561
well, if I write a@l b@l, what does that mean ? 484561_488210
a@l times b@l . 488210_489745
so you can just have them next to each other, right ? 489745_492440
yeah . 492440_493041
and that still means multiplication . 493041_494343
and then would I put like a@l b@l cubed, or a@l cubed and b@l cubed . 494343_498691
yep . 498691_499501
what ? 499501_500748
a@l cubed and b@l cubed . 500748_502445
is that what I would do ? 502445_503228
uhhuh . 503228_503941
like +... 503941_504778
I mean b@l cubed . 504778_510163
is that what I would put ? 510163_510885
uhhuh . 510885_511411
that's the answer . 511411_512251
that's how I would get it ? 512251_512940
I hope so . 512940_514140
keep working . 514140_514973
see the other ones . 514973_516076
so we put it in parentheses . 516076_517341
oh, that doesn't help . 517341_518580
yes, you could also do it in parentheses . 518580_520641
but we want you to get it expanded so that the powers are on each one of the variables . 520641_525258
