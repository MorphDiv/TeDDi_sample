after twenty years, O'Henry is the title of the story .
and it's regarding two friends who agreed to meet at an appointed
on the appointed night, which was a cold dark windy night near the
the shorter fellow met there .
well he stood there in front of the doorway with his cigar lit .
and he waited for his buddy to appear .
and he didn't seem to appear .
but an officer did come .
he talked with him for a while .
and the gentleman that's waiting, I forgot to mention his name was
Jimmy told about the guy that he was waiting for .
and the officer chatted briefly .
Jimmy lit up a cigar .
and he did not even recognize the face of the officer as being that
but he continued to wait on .
and he saw a guy come across the street .
and he thought oh, this has got to be him .
and he waited .
and he looked at the guy .
and there was no resemblance of the friend he knew way back there .
but Jimmy was a notorious figure .
and he was being arrested .
his buddy that was he waiting for was now a police officer .
couldn't do the job himself .
and decided that he would send a plainclothes man who was waiting
and that plainclothes man arrested Jimmy .
and passed on a note .
and the note was from his officer friend .
it said he knew that he had become a notorious criminal .
and that now he could not do the job of arresting him .
so he asked a fellow officer to do it .
and that concludes my story .
are there ghosts .
as a child I lived with nine other siblings .
there were five girls, five boys in the family .
and we would often have to double up in bedrooms .
as I got older, I got a bedroom to myself .
and often at night we would talk about spooky things .
and seeing ghosts and things like that .
and I thought it would funny to take the white bedspread from by
put it over my head .
and go down to my brother's room .
and there would be Badger, Lloyd, and Joseph all huddled there .
and I would go .
and stand in the doorway .
and go +"/.
+" whooooo@o .
and they would say +"/.
+" do you see it .
+" do you see it ?
+" look, it's coming toward the bed .
+" it's coming toward the bed .
and I would do that .
but I wouldn't stay too long because if I was caught I was really
and I would slowly flow out the room .
go back to my bed .
and get in the bed .
and laugh .
and at breakfast the next morning they would ask my mother are
she says +"/.
+" there's no such thing .
+" and don't let me hear that foolishness again .
and so the next night I'd go back .
and repeat it .
and they'd ask her about ghosts .
and she'd say +"/.
+" I told you there's no such thing as ghosts .
+" and that's it .
and then she said +"/.
+" if you think there is a ghost .
+" then you go .
+" and try to touch it .
well, that night I went back .
I thought +"/.
+" this is going to really going to be fun .
+" I don't think they'll come up to that bedspread .
so I came into the room .
and I'd stand for just, well +...
I went into the room .
and stood for a little while .
and then I eased over to the bed .
and they were whimpering under the cover .
and finally, I would reach out my arm as if I was going to touch .
and they would all would jump over like leapfrog over one another .
and instead they xxx .
out from under the cover came these little combat boots .
and they worked over my head under that bedspread .
and I couldn't scream out .
and so I made it back to my room .
fell in my bed with the bedspread over my head .
and whimpered until I went off to sleep .
the next morning, was sitting at the breakfast table .
and they told my mother that they saw a ghost .
she said +"/.
+" you did ?
+" yeah, but we got it last night .
and I never told anyone .
I was under the cover .
so that's my secret to this day .
and I don't think they'll even own up to it at this point .
so are there really ghosts ?
