xxx there are a lot of confusing things in here . 1_27776
I'm sure you have questions, make sense . 27776_31495
you can just start where the book starts and just move through
xxx it starts on one hundred and thirty four, uh, one hundred and
you can start by defining inferential statistics for me . 45113_49621
ok . 49621_49990
inferential statistics is taking, uh, two means from a couple of,
so, our focus in doing that is, when you have a sample, um,
yeah . 71230_71436
that's right . 71436_72268
but, sometimes we have a sample that not necessarily that
that's what these statistics allow you to do . 77005_79091
to apply information about these samples to your larger population .
um, equivalency between groups . 85035_89666
there's two ways that, to maintain equivalency in groups . 89666_93435
uh, two ways ? 93435_97930
uh huh . 97930_98681
one is, uh, random . 98681_101161
right . 101161_101656
randomization . 101656_103145
xxx . 103145_103770
and number of subjects . 103770_109816
you just, um, control for all variables . 109816_113560
which is pretty much impossible . 113560_115513
that's why randomization is the preferred method .
and if you do have these equivalent groups, you're going to assume
and therefore, if one group differs from another and you can say
uh huh . 144096_147960
ok ? 147960_148455
let's move on to the null hypothesis . 148455_149935
do you want to explain that to me ? 149935_154040
the null hypothesis ? 154040_155406
it's, uh, +... 155406_155751
I guess it's, uh, you're setting a hypothesis and you either reject
I really can't explain it that much . 174720_176875
you have, uh, two hypotheses . 176875_180506
uh, when you set up an experiment, you basically have what's called
and I've seen it written like that . 184890_186601
and the experimental hypothesis . 186601_188993
and, what the null hypothesis almost always states is that there
the experimental hypothesis is there is a difference . 200995_205016
and sometimes you'll you'll want to say, if it's bigger or smaller .
so, let's say, uh, we're doing an experiment on Head Start . 208433_212113
are you familiar with that program ? 212113_213586
xxx . 213586_214875
ok, well, you don't have to be that familiar with it . 214875_216738
um, let's say our experimental hypothesis is: kids who start in
so, that was our experimental hypothesis . 232721_234913
kids given Head Start will do better than kids not given Head
our null hypothesis then would be that it didn't, they didn't . 239008_244240
it would just be that equal groups: the ones that did have it and
understand ? 252088_252560
there's no difference because of Head Start . 252560_254303
ok, um, so this is the difference, is due to the independent
the variable that we're manipulating . 263295_267038
and, uh, this doesn't mean that the groups are identically the same
or they could be identical &=mumbles means . 275968_278118
but it does mean that, uh, the difference between the groups is due
ok . 282901_283501
so, it deviates, it deviates from chance . 283501_286621
and that's &=mumbles difference there . 286621_288461
um, the reason we use these particular statements is this is
you can't really do it with deal with this one
that's why we either reject or accept this one . 307068_308483
and if you reject this, they use the term, “accept the experimental
um, because you can reject this and this
uh huh . 331230_332020
the kids who are given Head Start do worse which means that
so, we even have, this is obviously, you reject this
this is still not correct . 344266_346321
so, all we can say is we either, um, accept or reject the null
and by doing that we can never prove the experimental hypothesis . 352571_359145
it's kind of unfortunate, but that's the purpose of the replication
why can't you get that ? 368953_370696
um, because it's not, it's not, it doesn't lend itself that
because if there is no difference it's easier to &=mumbles . 387393_392231
yeah . 392231_392480
ok . 392480_393120
and you reject this, you reject the null hypothesis, there is a low
&=nods . 405735_407430
is that, I guess that's the most official way you can say it . 407430_411678
differences, um, that the differences are due to random error is a
so, you reject it ? 418286_419038
uh huh . 419038_419581
ok . 419581_422286
do you have any questions about either the null or experimental
no, no, no . 426813_429610
ok . 429610_429881
that's going to be the basis of most of what we talk about today . 429881_433441
um, some of what we talk about today anyway . 433441_437290
ok, probability and sampling distributions . 437290_441498
um this is more attaching, putting this particular thing
so, this is an example of a sampling distribution . 460980_465031
it'll be our sampling distribution . 465031_471576
I'll pretend it's bell shaped . 471576_473686
ok, um, so, we administer an IQ test . 473686_490220
let's just say, we'll go back to our Head Start . 490220_492220
and this is our range of results, for this particular test
ok . 499011_500043
we need to set what is called your probability level which I've
you've had statistics ? 510745_511761
yeah . 511761_512018
ok . 512018_512513
that's gonna make this a lot easier . 512513_513875
let's just say point o@l five because that's the most commonly used
so, if this is the poison distribution of scores, it's
and what that would do, well, what this says is that if there is a
there's a ninety five percent chance of sureness in that and only a
um, sometimes what experimenters do is they'll say, “All right,
that gives you a much smaller probability of making a mistake . 582643_589825
&=nods uh huh . 589825_591025
and we'll see this a little bit more when we come back and talk
because that's related, interrelated with your, uh, probability
what do you, what do you do ? 602008_604311
do you reject the null hypothesis if it's, like if it's point o@l
if it's less than that do you reject it or when it's greater ? 608090_611626
greater . 611626_612746
ok . 612746_614256
we're actually going to run through and do a manual t_test before
I'm not gonna, you're not expected to memorize the formula . 626760_630240
everyone does t_test by computer nowadays anyway . 630240_635593
ok, how about sample size ? 635593_639200
all right, sample size often refers to simply an n@l . 639200_653071
and it's very important in relation to this, uh, accept and reject
and you'll see it more when we plug it into the t, the t_test
but the higher your N, the more likely you are to obtain an
&=nods head yes . 677345_678160
that pretty much xxx . 678160_680368
but what's interesting is if you have an extremely high n@l, a one
&=nods yes . 699955_701951
I'm going to ask you to accept that until we get to the formula,
so, when they say in statistics, some, you know, can lie . 706288_712095
if I have a point that I want to prove, I'm just going to go out an
oh ! 725161_725998
then I can end up, uh, rejecting the null hypothesis . 725998_732293
ok, t_test and the f_test . 732293_738573
um, they're both similar in their function . 738573_742621
um, the F_test is an expansion of the t_test really . 742621_749876
and what do these two t_tests do ? 749876_752853
they, uh, essentially are statistical tests that tell you whether
and, um, a score is obtained and you look up the score on a table
xxx . 786110_788795
ok . 788795_789146
they're both the same right ? 789146_790578
in function ? 790578_791955
xxx . 791955_792203
yeah . 792203_792691
in function they're the same, yeah . 792691_793955
although you do, you use them in a different situation . 793955_796453
yeah . 796453_796811
the t_test is ideally suited to compare two groups and only two
&=nods yes . 811595_812826
and xxx it's a good test for that . 812826_815605
um, the F_test is a more general statistic test and you can use it
and, you don't need to worry about this, but you can use it to
I don't know if that's the next tutoring session or a couple down
ok +... 843456_844953
so, um, if the t_test yields a critical score and this critical
you get the critical from the book ? 867330_870606
hmm ? 870606_870935
you get the critical from back of the book ? 870935_872615
from the table, uh huh, and I'll show you how to use the table . 872615_874773
good . 874773_875173
you probably remember from statistics . 875173_882916
ok, what the t_test really is, remember you have two groups the
and formula ok, the group difference is the difference between
so, you've got two group means . 923981_925426
the within group variability is the amount of variability of the
and, essentially you can think of it this way . 932460_939018
the group means over the random error . 939018_946306
and you can see then that t would get larger if you had a larger
uh huh . 961203_962745
ok ? 962745_963128
so, the formula, now, the formula the book gave, I'm not sure
I haven't really looked at it . 976763_977655
but I use simpler formula from another book that suits us just as
it's the sample mean minus the population mean xxx standard
now, you would use this formula if you knew, you have to know the
so, if it's something like a census, you're seeing how you're group
so +... 1026405_1027845
I lied to you a little while ago when I said that if it's smaller
ok . 1053726_1054931
so, say you have a critical value of four point six nine or
and this yields something higher . 1061050_1068673
then you would say it's significant, your difference is significant
I'm sorry . 1075681_1080330
all right, um, when you need to use the table, you have to be able
I know that's kind of a vague description . 1100466_1104560
um, but do you understand how to use it statistically ? 1104560_1108751
um, what it is is, uh, the number in group one plus the number in
so, if we have one group with ten subjects, the degrees of freedom
if you have three groups with ten subjects each, xxx . 1143843_1157580
&=nods yes . 1157580_1158258
if you had different numbers you'd still be able to think about it .
and if the number of scores that are free to vary . 1167988_1174893
what's that mean, free to vary ? 1174893_1177951
free to, um +... 1177951_1185048
Let's say you have a frequency distribution like this, the degrees
ok . 1209618_1210366
ok ? 1210366_1212023
um, xxx . 1212023_1216590
there's one_tailed and two_tailed designs . 1216590_1219078
and that's pretty much straightforward . 1219078_1222078
tell me the difference between them . 1222078_1226758
uh, two_tailed and one_tailed ? 1226758_1230101
in case you don't know the results and you're trying to prove
it's if you say that, “You know, I don't know if there's going to
so, what you do is you would have, you set your significance level
so it's kind of a the movement restricts it a little more . 1261010_1270713
and you also use the table differently . 1270713_1276145
and of course a one_tailed test is when you make a prediction that
now we're going to talk about type one and type two errors . 1282658_1294585
xxx . 1294585_1312205
ok . 1312205_1315380
um, a type_one error is, uh ? 1315380_1322475
rejecting the null hypothesis when it's really true . 1322475_1325771
uh huh . 1325771_1326115
and type_two ? 1326115_1329733
is, uh, accepting it when it's true, false, when it's false . 1329733_1337491
the best way to think of this, I have not seen any, a decision
so, let's see make a true statement xxx null hypothesis is
you accept &=achoo ! 1360443_1368161
excuse me . 1368161_1368523
so, if we accept it when it's true, that's good . 1368523_1383891
and if we reject it when it's false, that's good . 1383891_1386865
but if we accept it when it's actually false, we've made a type_two
if we reject it when it's true, we've made a type_one . 1400625_1406536
the book goes on to say that this is in psychology
because what that means is that, uh, we're rejecting, when there
and just the way political journal system works is that they're
they don't want it . 1442895_1443735
the want to show that this treatment has a, makes a difference . 1443735_1446861
so this has a good chance of being funded . 1446861_1451486
if you print it, then it's going to be latched on to by people and
on the other hand, this one right here
well, somebody following will come along and will show you xxx . 1470828_1476700
in psychology, we may think of this one as a more dangerous type of
however, if, uh, we're in a court case and this is also
um, with a type_one error we reject the null hypothesis but the
but that still gives us a five percent chance of making a mistake .
and, uh, you're probability of making a type_one error is always
so, the lower your significance level, the lower the chance of
now there's not really that, ok, so this point o@l five five
so xxx that's pretty good chance . 1590411_1599308
there's probably all right, you can think of it this way . 1599308_1605900
if there's a five percent chance of making a mistake, saying
that's a pretty scary concept . 1631748_1634425
just a little aside there &=laughs . 1634425_1638385
xxx cynical, but xxx . 1638385_1642665
a type_two error, um, you can't really assign it the same, so, same
it's hard to, uh, um, say what your chance of making a type_one
so, if you say, “hey, yeah, I'm going to set my significance level
but that's going to, uh, really hinder my chances of, um, that's
why's that ? 1687175_1688831
because this is so restrictive, this particular number is so
oh, Ok, I see . 1698941_1700541
difference . 1700541_1700933
so, if we make it hard to reach that null hypothesis, which is what
that increases our chances of making a type_two error . 1718588_1721771
Um, choosing an alpha level . 1721771_1733266
choosing significance level, um what I usually see is point
and that's really for no reason . 1743835_1745866
I've seen, sometimes I've seen one . 1745866_1750826
&=nods yes and mumbles . 1750826_1751753
uh huh . 1751753_1752378
sometimes, you'll see in different types of studies, if you're
and that's because you're looking for maybe subtle changes and
because your technique isn't refined and you may have one part of
so, if you're doing like, almost a preliminary type of research,
uh, on the other hand, if you're doing replications of somebody
+" man, I read this study but I don't, I don't see how that is
but generally you see point zero one or point zero five as the
and that's just because with a clinical background, I think of it
but, say we have a particular therapy . 1863216_1869245
we're working with clients now and we have a particular therapy and
but we don't really see much of a marked improvement in how they're
so, we'd say “yes, it's statistically significant, but it doesn't
and I think that's an important argument . 1904851_1907938
that's, that's one of the big philosophy questions in psychology,
and now, there are people that say, “now, I don't really care about
and in clinical psychology I would, I would agree that it's a
but in experimental psychology you'd see a little less of that . 1933778_1937265
so, uh, say we, we've set our alpha level real low, real low and we
xxx well, we've increased our chances of making a type_two error
so, when we accept the null hypothesis . 1964154_1964823
that not necessarily meaning that you xxx, and another thing I said
&=nods head yes . 1985521_1988718
&=erases part of the board . 1988718_1989670
ok, any questions so far ? 1989670_1997261
what I want to do now is ask you questions . 1997261_2001733
I have a bunch of them for you . 2001733_2009556
and they're just basically over what we covered . 2009556_2014420
xxx . 2014420_2018605
um, what's the difference between the null and experimental
ok, the null is, uh, showing that there's no difference while the
um, when does a researcher reject the null hypothesis ? 2028666_2034226
when the, when the probability, uh, is the relationship is, I
ignore that question . 2046995_2047521
we'll do a t_test and look on the chart and do all that . 2047521_2050873
I didn't go over that with you . 2050873_2054273
um, when we say something is statistically significant, what are
that, uh +/. 2061951_2064615
not really in terms of looking at the table, but just in general
that, uh, that there's a difference in the independent variable
uh huh . 2078295_2078718
so, the difference is due to the ? 2078718_2080695
xxx . 2080695_2082046
and not due to ? 2082046_2082398
random chance . 2082398_2083438
right . 2083438_2083853
very good . 2083853_2085701
um, differentiate between type_one and type_two error . 2085701_2090958
ok . 2090958_2091366
type I is, uh, rejecting the null when it's true and type_two is,
uh huh Ok . 2101101_2106325
umm, describe two hypothetical experiments, one being a
a two_tailed test would probably be, uh, showing whether a
ok . 2132663_2133083
and a one_tailed test being that if a drug does indeed have a
ok . 2141235_2141620
effect . 2141620_2143010
ok ? 2143010_2143921
so, xxx you look at, uh, in early research on some unknown
ok, what are the two ways we make groups look alike ? 2152866_2159625
uh, random sampling . 2159625_2162953
uh huh . 2162953_2163563
and, uh, manipulation of control . 2163563_2167713
you use control for every variable ? 2167713_2169336
it's not impossible ! 2169336_2172025
but, you will if you're not matching . 2172025_2175665
xxx control and that's within the, find a group subjects and then
and that's called matching . 2188506_2190808
xxx . 2190808_2192328
at the end of the semester . 2192328_2194560
um, when is a t_test appropriate ? 2194560_2197495
uh, when is it ? 2197495_2200000
uh huh . 2200000_2200408
uh I guess when you want to, uh, try to find a significant
right . 2215400_2215781
if you're looking at two different groups and you want to see if
that's also the importance of being equivalent . 2224110_2226301
and when is an F_test appropriate ? 2226301_2230830
xxx . 2230830_2233430
it's just the more general effect . 2233430_2237430
and you can also use it in factorial designs xxx . 2237430_2245636
ok . 2245636_2246051
um . 2246051_2253088
ok . 2272391_2274296
I'm doing a study with four different groups . 2274296_2275833
um, what would be my degrees of freedom ? 2275833_2279441
uh, fifteen, wait xxx six, four, four . 2279441_2287280
nineteen minus . 2287280_2289936
fourteen . 2289936_2290985
four, yeah, right . 2290985_2292343
degrees of freedom . 2292343_2293456
oh, ok . 2293456_2307435
what's the relationship between significance level and, uh,
uh, the lower the significance level, the more, uh, the more
xxx . 2322591_2328006
xxx . 2328006_2330320
yeah . 2330320_2330526
right . 2330526_2330901
and it's if your significance level is too high ? 2330901_2335285
hmm, a point twenty five significance level . 2335285_2342838
you need a more chance, have a better chance of making a type_one ?
uh huh . 2346773_2347158
because you're saying, I don't know, even if it varies even a
ok . 2352088_2354208
what I'm going to do now is give you a hypothetical experiment
and I'll let you figure out, um, a few things about it . 2363775_2372838
uh, let's go back to uh, t_tests . 2372838_2380566
you know, that's population mean and group mean . 2380566_2386381
right ? 2386381_2387870
and your deviation mean is like that . 2387870_2390358
ok . 2390358_2391366
a researcher is examining fetal alcohol syndrome . 2391366_2398493
can you xxx that ? 2398493_2400766
ok, and believes that alcohol consumed during pregnancy lowers
so, what would be our experimental hypothesis and our null
well, would you repeat that ? 2413990_2415636
a researcher is examining fetal alcohol syndrome and believes that
ok, so your, uh, experimental hypothesis would be, uh,
uh huh . 2436743_2437163
and the null would be, uh, that, that the increase of alcohol
right . 2446315_2446538
and would you call this a one_or two_tailed test ? 2446538_2448795
uh, I'd say two_tailed . 2448795_2451875
because ? 2451875_2452778
because you really don't know the xxx you're trying to xxx . 2452778_2457795
but we're saying that, uh, a researcher believes that alcohol
ok, then I would change it to one_tailed . 2463866_2465545
right . 2465545_2465858
because he's got a specific belief about what's going on . 2465858_2469473
ok . 2469473_2470515
um, pregnant female rats are injected with alcohol and the weight
so, our independent variable is alcohol . 2477290_2487851
and our dependent variable the variable we're measuring is
ok ? 2497665_2499193
um, extensive prior research has shown that this particular strain
so, looking at this formula . 2513063_2515581
xxx . 2515581_2522116
our population mean is eight point four . 2522116_2529828
that's from all the research done with this particular kind of
would that be xxx, too ? 2531708_2532836
um, no . 2532836_2534243
it's just that it's convenient . 2534243_2536860
oh . 2536860_2537205
I could use a more complicated version of this . 2537205_2538985
if we didn't know the population mean and we were just comparing
&=shakes head yes . 2542688_2544825
but in this case, we're just comparing one group that we don't know
the researcher's sample of one hundred pups . 2546600_2552728
shows that they weight an average of seven point nine eight grams .
and a standard deviation of one point three . 2564375_2571913
so, you want to set up the equation ? 2571913_2574800
xxx . 2574800_2576225
xxx . 2576225_2578416
no, I, I want you to write it up there first
ok . 2584793_2603353
um do you have a calculator ? 2603353_2611206
how many decimal places ? 2611206_2658576
um, just take it to three places . 2658576_2661318
ok . 2661318_2662916
now, what do we do, find out if, if it is actually significant . 2662916_2668526
um, first of all, what are the degrees of freedom ? 2668526_2671621
of the particular experiment . 2671621_2673525
how many in each group ? 2673525_2680005
xxx well, actually there's a hundred and there's act Hmm ! 2680005_2688171
it's actually only one group . 2688171_2689963
one group of a hundred ? 2689963_2691596
uh huh . 2691596_2691940
ok, I would say ninety nine . 2691940_2693276
yes . 2693276_2694675
ok +... 2694675_2697075
ok, we go to page two hundred and seventy five and uh, uh,
uh huh . 2710163_2712170
because uh, where we've indicated it's a one_tailed test . 2712170_2716170
if it was a two tailed test, we'd use this column
it's a one_tailed test and you find their degrees of freedom, let's
xxx +... 2737913_2739466
and if our number is greater than that number, then we would say we
if, if it's, uh, greater than that number, we would have
in this case, t@l equals point zero three two which is not less, so
&=shakes head yes . 2767048_2773345
xxx different data which probably just brought back a rush of
&=laughs that was a couple of years ago . 2778360_2779840
xxx do you have any, uh, questions on any of this material ? 2779840_2785928
you've just about answered them all . 2785928_2789143
ok . 2789143_2789703
that's, that's not too, uh, it's not too difficult . 2789703_2794655
the hard part of the concepts behind the statistics . 2794655_2796975
it's always easy to plug in numbers . 2796975_2798800
but the important thing is you understand, um, why you are plugging
&=shakes head yes . 2806321_2808078
when we say something's significant, what does that mean ? 2808078_2809983
xxx ok, well, we're out of time . 2809983_2813223
xxx . 2813223_2814646
alright . 2814646_2817350
did you have class today ? 2817350_2823230
