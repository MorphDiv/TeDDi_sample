&~www .
okay well there's this girl in our class and she
and it's funny !
<and when> well when we fall out she's too stubborn .
and she insists <that it's never my fault it's> that it's
that it's always my fault .
and then I get in trouble because she goes and tells .
and <she gets in trouble> she gets me into trouble .
and it winds me up because it looks like she's not in the wrong ,
she started it .
and I don't like it because she says &-um all +...
she's a bit hypocritical because +...
I got nothing against religious people or nothing , but she goes to
but she doesn't exactly love thy neighbor and that type of thing .
oh right .
and she gets mad (be)cause I'm I don't have the same lifestyle
like we've got different beliefs , different opinions type thing .
and it just annoys me really , because people should settle their
but they some people don't bother to .
yeah some people don't try .
yeah that annoys me .
&~www .
