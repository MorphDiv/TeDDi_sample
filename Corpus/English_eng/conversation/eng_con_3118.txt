there's one diagonal line of symmetry . 59685_61170
it has to go from the brown corner to the yellow corner um but
it is . 71551_73663
yep . 73663_74118

no way . 262506_262938
no we didn't even know what symmetrical was . 262938_265341
so what do we know about that word now symmetrical ? 265341_267806
ssh hold on one at a time . 267806_270610
now we um now we know um that it means that you can fold it in half
okay what else is there anything else that we know about ? 282070_285503
is there anything else we know about the word symmetrical that we
Nathan gave us one explanation of that word told us something about
sort of like same . 299303_301915
it's sort of like same ? 301915_303798
um tell me more about that . 303798_306283
+^ what is the same about something that is symmetrical . 306283_309120

well um there's two um blue there's one blue hour glass at the top
uhhuh . 367293_368325
you see the triangle will touch that orange that triangle and that
so &~l this is what I think Alex is saying and Alex you correct
Alex is saying +//. 386640_388341
oh it concerns me if I see people who are looking somewhere besides
how could you think about what they are saying and what I am saying
the blue and oranges strip quilt on the end made by Alex and Kevin .
Alex is saying that if you took the first strip of their quilt the
the first and second strips he is saying are symmetrical to each
they made part of a symmetrical design because they um they would
Kevin . 432953_434841
well we can also like flip the top strip um sideways to make it
we're not trying to make we not trying to um what do you mean when
well you could like this quilt is symmetrical but like um like
where would I fold the top strip that you're seeing another way
where would the fold be ? 471936_473040
um . 473040_475951
(be)cause Kevin we're not seeing where you want us to think about
are you asking us to think about just the top strip ? 484735_487231
yeah . 487231_488255
show us what you're thinking about . 488255_490198
it could be symmetrical if you take the top strip and like fold it
hmm would it be symmetrical ? 497748_500373
no . 500373_500830
no . 500830_501536
what Kevin is noticing the end of that top strip is an arrangement
Brittany where should your eyes be ? 506318_507951
++ uh is an arrangement of blue and orange triangles that would
but Kevin what about that rest of that design ? 511718_514169
then the orange hour glass would touch the blue diamonds but oh
you have a blue hour glass shape as Alex calls it that would be
so is your strip symmetrical ? 527193_529271
the way you just said to fold one end to the other ? 529271_532681
no . 532681_533093
is there another way that that strip is symmetrical ? 533093_539750
is their strip just one strip of their quilt symmetrical ? 539750_540861
um<yeah> . 540861_541725
<Nathan> you're not even looking their <quilt> . 541725_542975
yes . 542975_543373
Sara where would you divide that strip so that it would be &~sym um
hmm . 548091_548491
yep going over to show us will help . 548491_552108
we need to know just what you're looking at and thinking about . 552108_554208
like right in the middle just pretend that's about right in the
and you'd fold it over and it would be symmetrical . 561723_565291
would it ? 565291_566355
mmhm . 566355_567255
okay . 567255_567790
