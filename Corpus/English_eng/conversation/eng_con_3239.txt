is only two so it should be four hundred to eight . 0_4555
xxx eight xxx . 4555_6721
xxx miss, is that xxx ? 6721_13008
no . 13008_15328
no . 15328_16648
let me finish this off first . 16648_21008
let's just start again here . 21008_23103
turn around . 23103_25233
what do we do when xxx ? 25233_29030
just wait a second . 29030_30263
you've got four hundred and eight dollars and you want two hundred to four . 30263_35366
so two hundred shares equals four hundred and eight dollars, one share is two dollars, two hundred shares would be four hundred, two times two hundred . 35366_47855
and four shares would be two times four which is eight . 47855_51038
all right ? 51038_53380
I'll help you in a minute Kelly . 53380_55356
okay . 55356_56148
let's return to this question here . 56148_59230
two to five . 59230_61155
but I want to change two hundred and ten to something else . 61155_71306
not dollars . 71306_71916
enough now, thanks . 71916_74438
Dan, Stephen . 74438_76965
okay . 76965_82718
I'll go with Smarties . 82718_83998
you need to create for me a story to explain why I would want to divide Smarties in the ratio two to five . 83998_97501
Nicole ? 97501_100101
because you only need certain +... 100101_102446
because xxx . 102446_103535
wait a second . 103535_104181
Nicole first . 104181_105100
thanks . 105100_105550
because you might only like a certain color . 105550_108720
but that how is that going to make a story ? 108720_113031
how is that going to make a story that says divide two hundred and ten Smarties into the ratio two to five . 113031_118950
one person might want color and one wants the other color . 118950_121886
and there's more of one color like the blue ones there's heaps of those, and the brown no, and then there's a color xxx red . 121886_132258
no . 132258_132886
I can't can't quite see . 132886_134735
Bobbie Jo ? 134735_135391
there's seven people xxx . 135391_141376
no . 141376_141806
that's a different question isn't it ? 141806_142703
dividing two hundred and ten Smarties between seven people is a different question . 142703_147945
how many people have you actually got here ? 147945_151026
two . 151026_153421
two . 153421_153901
only two people involved in this story . 153901_156181
only person A who gets two shares and person B who gets ? 156181_163933
five shares so you need to think of a story as to why two people would get different amounts of Smarties . 163933_170875
Lindsey ? 170875_171851
A . 171851_172460
A . 172460_173090
um, xxx to what person B xxx . 173090_177563
all right . 177563_178413
so, I had some Smarties and person A stole some ? 178413_183355
yeah . 183355_184081
person B stole some from person A . 184081_188290
person B pays +... 188290_190410
oh, okay . 190410_191330
so I had some Smarties which I thought I was going to give equally between A and B, but B was greedy and stole some, so, they were now in the ratio two to five . 191330_208398
how many did he have ? 208398_209360
okay . 209360_210911
think of another quantity . 210911_213503
not Smarties this time, something else . 213503_216261
marbles . 216261_217256
marbles, surfboards ? 217256_221901
I think Smarties +... 221901_224875
let's move past the chocolate . 224875_226281
bodyboards . 226281_227901
ah, Skittles . 227901_229795
bodyboards . 229795_231880
can you make me up a story to divide bodyboards in the ratio . 231880_236296
we have two hundred and ten bodyboards and we want them divided in the ratio two to five . 236296_241281
eight ? 241281_243263
no, no, no . 243263_244161
if you think you've got a story put your hand up . 244161_246910
Tanya ? 246910_251896
Sam . 251896_254896
pardon ? 254896_259523
xxx . 259448_263236
yes you do . 263236_264365
what is it ? 264365_265581
no she said she said one's a pro surfboard, one's just a beginner . 265581_269541
okay . 269541_270941
so there's two hundred and ten surfboards where ? 270941_277916
on the beach ? 277916_278931
bodyboards . 278931_279810
in a shop . 279810_280498
in a shop ? 280498_282081
on the shore . 282081_283110
and a pro surfer and an amateur walk into the shop and they buy some boards in the ratio two to five which means that the amateur +... 283110_298468
who would be the amateur who do you think ? 298468_299730
a@l or b@l ? 299730_300320
b@l . 300320_300810
a@l . 300810_301440
a would be the amateur and they get how many boards would they have got ? 301440_305973
thirty . 305973_306518
thirty . 306518_306990
sixty . 306990_307471
sixty boards and the other person bought fifteen . 307471_311421
might have been better to knock off a zero in that story perhaps, eh ? 311421_315771
six boards and fifteen . 315771_317151
you wouldn't even need you just need one . 317151_319380
well . 319380_319725
maybe they're getting very serious about bodyboarding . 319725_323845
okay . 323845_324350
I want you to write a story now about the ratio that you created for your friend to do . 324350_330268
well make a new ratio if you don't want to write about that one . 330268_336358
but make a ratio and a quantity and write down a story for that question . 336358_366451
I didn't get to work my ratio out Miss . 366451_369551
you can't work it out ? 369551_370030
divide eighty dollars in the ratio twenty three to one . 370030_373991
twenty three . 373991_375895
is it ? 375895_377303
so that's twenty four boxes all together . 377303_380175
so eighty divided by twenty four +... 380175_384006
is ten, eighty over twenty four, they're both divide by eight, aren't they ? 384006_392053
so that would be ten over three which would be three and a third . 392053_400733
so one box would have three and one third . 400733_405348
so twenty three would have twenty three times three and a third . 405348_410811
can you work that out in your head ? 410811_414421
well, it'd be twenty three wholes and twenty three thirds . 414421_420470
we divide twenty three by three . 420470_423420
follow what I'm saying ? 423420_426796
one box is three and a third . 426796_432310
all right . 432310_433451
so two boxes would be ? 433451_435083
six and two thirds . 435083_438308
three boxes would be nine and three thirds but three thirds is another whole so three boxes we'd have, ten . 438308_447401
okay . 447401_448323
so twenty three boxes has three and a third times twenty three . 448323_453083
all right . 453083_454691
which would be three times twenty three, which would be, uh, three times +... 454691_464178
sixty nine and twenty three thirds . 464178_468201
all right ? 468201_470386
yeah . 470386_471450
now twenty three thirds, how many wholes is that ? 471450_473610
well twenty three divided by three is seven remainder two, so you actually have sixty nine plus seven . 473610_483241
and it would be seventy six and two thirds . 483241_489585
okay ? 489585_491558
there were eleven boxes and seventy seven apples . 491558_503045
three were xxx and eight xxx . 503045_508213
three boxes . 508213_508990
xxx . 508990_511580
yeah . 511580_512179
that would ? 512179_513445
yeah . 513445_514211
yes . 514211_519211
you had seventy seven apples, that's what you're saying, and you packed them in the ratio and they went to market in a ratio of three to eight . 519211_529925
how many went to market ? 529925_532245
three . 532245_533085
xxx . 533085_534420
three . 534420_535355
what happened to my story ? 535355_538601
yeah . 538601_539368
isn't that right ? 539368_539865
well I said that +... 539865_541105
you had seventy seven apples and you packed them into boxes . 541105_545150
all right . 545150_546865
but you don't need to tell that in the story because that's what the person has to work out . 546865_551270
seventy seven apples +... 551270_554240
and they were packed in two boxes . 554240_556528
xxx in the ratio and they went to market in the ratio three xxx . 556528_566308
xxx . 566308_567330
