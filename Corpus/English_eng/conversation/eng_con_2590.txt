&=overhead_used_throughout I just wanted to revisit this issue of when a positive portrayal is negative . 2925_7565
(0.7) and the case here is &-uh the study that you hadta read by Innocent Fagan on the Cosby Show . 12065_20905
(0.26) okay so when positive portrayals are negative Innocent Fagan the Cosby Show talking about different views whether the Cosby Show was a good thing for portraying a counter stereotypical view of african americans or whether it was a bad thing . 47875_60995
so does somebody wanna summarize for me twenty five words or less what the positive view is here ? 61495_66295
the positive view of the Cosby Show in this article ? 68595_71255
(0.6) remember you will be anonymous +... 78115_79295
yeah ?
show a professional black family in a way that &-um a very white collar family had been shown before . 83915_90135
why is that positive ? 90555_91295
&-um well +/.
+, counter stereotypical &-um this's the kind of family that'd been mostly limited to white people &-um .
so what should that do ? 92195_101755
you know &~wha what should that do for african americans as a group ? 102235_104915
well it should change or contribute to the change of stereotypes by &-uh you know letting letting other letting outgroups know that there's another side to <the story> . 106285_116705
right excellent . 116905_118345
the the first argument is that you know outgroups that is nonafrican americans watching the Cosby Show should get the idea that african americans are not all you know name your portrayal criminals &-um I'm thinking of Sanford and Son junkmen &-um blue collar workers and so on . 118795_135195
it's a counter stereotypical portrayal and should be teaching white Americans that african americans can make it you know up high as well . 135475_142055
so positive view counter stereotypical (0.8) challenge existing views you know the idea that if you come to the screen thinking that all african americans are poor or criminals when you watch the Cosby Show that should tell you that that's not the case . 142625_167565
(0.4) also you know the positive view +... 171915_173455
includes the idea that &-um that this was &~th this wasn't a typical portrayal . 175435_183275
this was a kind of groundbreaking portrayal . 183515_185455
it stood out . 185995_186655
&-um it was kind_of a its_about_time@q argument . 187135_189355
it's about time african americans are portrayed positively . 189615_192795
okay so there's sort_of a relief with it well thank goodness finally <there's a good> there's a good &~por portrayal . 193755_198135
what about the negative view ? 198635_199815
does anybody wanna bravely summarize what the argument was against the Cosby Show ? 201075_208195
(0.12) why could this be bad ? 211055_220395
yes ? 220795_221115
it ignores like the problems of discrimination <and stuff> . 221375_224575
why +//. 224795_225075
what would it do that was bad ? 225235_226475
what was the argument that the Cosby Show would be doing to white American's views of african americans ? 226475_231575
it'd make it seem that african americans who didn't succeed to that level are just lazy . 231955_236155
okay great . 236535_238775
&-um the negative view is that it supports stereotype because (0.5) if african americans can reach that level (0.5) those who don't must be lazy . 239435_264075
(0.6) okay ? 268005_268285
the argument against the Cosby Show was it's not necessarily realistic it may lead white viewers to think that if african americans can all reach the level that the Cosbys have reached then those who aren't doctors and lawyers must just be lazy . 270505_285625
(0.7) so you have these two you know &~counter countervailing &-uh views of this show . 293475_299755
does anybody have any thoughts on this ? 300235_301435
I mean do you think that one of these prevails over the other ? 301555_304395
do you agree with one of these more than the other ? 305555_307975
(0.9) you know these microphones can pick up your whispering too . 313275_319295
just kidding &-um (0.5) do you buy one of these arguments more than the other ? 320495_328335
yeah ? 329035_329475
I guess I would say that I I believe them but I think that it's kind_of unfair to criticize the show on those terms because it is a sitcom and I think that it has the positive characteristics so why should one show have to embody all of these characteristics ? 329955_347615
why not say you know this show is good because this shows that black people can reach this this height in society but then we should have other shows that also portray other things . 348005_357245
okay <I'm gonna> I'm gonna carry that comment on because I think it's a very valuable comment here . 357565_361165
&-um the the question is is it fair to jump on one show and to say that this show should embody everything that's needed for a positive portrayal of a group ? 361925_372965
&-um and I'm gonna recall your article that you hadta read by Graves just some thoughts from the Graves article to try to frame your thoughts about the Cosby Show +... 373545_382925
the first thought is +... 386565_390125
Graves makes a distinction between fiction and fact . 392865_395645
(0.7) one thing we should think about when we're thinking about all the portrayals not just one show but the aggregate of portrayals of a given group is how are the fictional portrayals constructed and how are the factual ones constructed ? 402975_417115
&-um I went over that Armstrong Neuendorf and Brentar article in class where they looked at entertainment versus news . 418035_424035
entertainment television had this positive portrayal of african americans whereas news had this negative portrayal . 424515_430775
so one thing Graves brings up in kind_of a roundabout way is &-um fact may carry more weight . 431325_438785
(0.4) first of all . 441185_443965
so if I see fictional portrayals of african americans as ambitious high achieving and so on but all of the factual ones the news ones are negative well what does that say ? 444185_458305
you know it basically says in the real world blacks are this in the fake world they could be like this . 458295_463575
&-um so overall it may cast a negative light on the group . 464435_466695
so it's just one thing to keep in mind fiction versus fact . 466955_469135
but the other thing &-um that Graves brings up is the importance of considering the aggregate and this is I'm not gonna say any names but this is related to the comment that came over here +... 469575_481075
&-um can we even win if we try to make every portrayal perfect ? 484815_488075
think back to Clark's notions of recognition and respect . 489795_497675
recognition is our is the group present at all respect is is the group are portrayals of the group &-um do they span as wide a range of roles as the group occupies in real life ? 498195_510395
well we could probably argue that it's impossible to do that within a given show . 511245_515245
you know we don't have that many characters in a given show . 516745_518985
we can't span as a wide a range of roles as a group occupies in real life in one show . 519185_523265
so maybe we should looking be looking at the collection of shows collection of programs (0.5) does it approach +... 524025_537725
respect ? 541115_541375
(0.7) so let me ask you a question then +... 542195_551035
as somebody who worked in the creative end as somebody who has a writing background and who's talked to people who've had +//. 552395_559055
who who write for a living one thing that writers are told again and again is to write well write what you know . 559655_565815
write what you know (be)cause you'll you'll be true to it . 566295_568855
so if writers are writing what they know and what they know turns out to be &-uh a very strongly white world then what might be a solution to &-uh to these sort_of &~s you know sporadic portrayals of african americans or any other group . 570085_590465
what might be a solution ? 590925_591745
what might be a way to get these groups portrayed with more respect ? 592105_595545
yeah ? 596405_596545
african american &~wr writers ? 596695_597975
⌈ <african american> ⌉ .
⌊ writers okay ⌋ . 598475_599355
the answer was and there's only one possible answer but I just want you to think about the possibility of it creators are taught to write what they know . 600615_608895
&-um one way to combat this is to get more african american writers out there . 610435_616095
more women writers out there more Hispanic writers out there more you know and you can go <on and> on and on especially dealing with the groups who're underrepresented . 616655_624675
you know it's the same reason that I don't have a a content analysis on this so my number could be wrong but it seems to me that about eight out_of ten movies that come out are centered in Los Angeles . 625755_636055
now you could say oh that's because it's easier to film there and they don't hafta travel and it's cheaper . 636835_640995
but part of it as well is that that's the city where most of the people who write this stuff live and they're writing what they know . 641395_647535
now do we fault them for writing what they know ? 648155_649975
you know do we say you should step out_of your comfort zone and try to write about other people ? 650115_655375
yeah we do that . 655895_657135
&-um but it goes against a_lot_of what they've been taught . 658835_661395
so the question the issue that I wanna bring up &-um is simply what do producers do ? 661895_671055
you know usually I don't address this but then I always have a student a a an astute student come up and say well basically it's kind_of a damned if you do damned if you don't thing . 673965_682165
how could anybody write a show and not be seen as racist or sexist ? 682865_687245
(0.4) so the question is what do producers do ? 688205_692585
you know one option is to write what they don't know that is to go against the advice of their craft . 692965_706165
but possibly a more viable option is to +... 707505_712545
get women and people of color +... 714125_717025
into industry . 720195_720875
and that is happening more and more . 722415_724335
it's a slow thing +... 725895_726775
you will see these changes over your lifetime you'll see major changes over your lifetime that's not gonna happen anytime soon +... 730555_736955
okay . 740855_741695
any last comments or questions on portrayals of ethnicity before I move into gender ? 745075_749515
(0.7) okay +... 753055_757115
I'm gonna kick this off with a quote +... 759895_761675
by Minna Antrim &{l=READING when a woman is very very bad she is awful but when a man is correspondingly good he is weird . 765055_770395
&}l=READING I like the quote because not only does it bring up the idea of women having to be nice and and kind and amicable all the time but it also brings up what men are expected to be the male gender role . 771995_782035
&-um men it &~s seems that men in the media always hafta be have &~s &~s a certain measure of ruggedness . 782915_788335
because if they're too good they're not good they're weird . 788995_791435
that's that doesn't fit in with what men are supposed to be . 791995_794095
(0.6) okay . 800875_801135
so like gender portrayals I'm sorry like ethnicity portrayals most of the research on gender portrayals is on one group . 801335_809815
as with ethnicity most of the research I covered was on african americans most of the research on gender is on women . 810835_816035
but I will cover work on men . 817115_818255
(0.8) okay &-um start with content analysis . 828015_831695
lemme give you a little background you don't hafta write this down yet . 833235_836595
&-um first of all it's a general generally known thing in the research that are a &~lat a_lot more men than there are women in the mass media . 837815_845815
typically three times as many men as women and on Saturday morning cartoons four times as many male as female characters . 846235_852435
&-uh stats for the Screen Actors Guild for the early nineties show that almost three quarters of all acting roles went to men . 853085_858725
but keep this in mind when I talk later about mass media and eating disorders and the thin ideal . 859825_864765
if women make up more than half the population but they're &~onl they're competing for twenty five percent of the roles what does this say about the extremes they have to go to to you know fit the ideal ? 865465_874945
&-um okay women are most often found in comedies soap operas family dramas &-um but what about other other types of media ? 876265_884945
a study by Matelski in nineteen eighty five looked at PBS (0.7) now you'd think if you're gonna see women given equal coverage and people of color and so on you'd see it on PBS right ? 885855_905475
this is what you'd think . 905775_906235
&-um well on PBS Matelski found that males outnumbered women two to one (0.9) he split &~u &-er he split up category of programming males outnumbered women two to one in each category (0.4) overall the characters were seventy two percent male . 908055_935215
so even PBS is giving more time to male characters . 938075_940955
(0.10) and then this other study by Ziegler and White looked at news . 945875_954955
and not women in the news not the way &-um like Enman looked at african americans as &-um criminals or as suspects Ziegler and White were looking at correspondents . 956785_968265
who were the news correspondents ? 969185_970305
who were the journalists ? 970365_971105
(0.5) eighty eight percent of the correspondents were male . 972805_979885
(0.5) so the news story or the I'm sorry the news study was really looking at who holds what jobs . 985515_992355
so we have almost ninety percent of all correspondents being male . 993655_996255
(0.4) so we have something on PBS we have something on news now you might ask what about advertisements ? 998735_1007995
well there's a classic &-uh book on on advertisements . 1010115_1015875
an extensive content analysis by Goffman in seventy nine and I'll update this for you in a minute . 1016915_1021815
but I wanna give you Goffman's categories . 1022655_1024275
(0.12) Goffman did this extensive &-um content analysis of women in advertising he was looking at print advertising . 1036835_1044675
and he came up with what he saw as recurrent themes in the way women are portrayed in ads . 1045875_1051595
and I'll show you examples of these themes as I go through . 1052115_1054075
the first one is he said women are very frequently shown lying down or looking up . 1054755_1059295
(0.6) what does that indicate ? 1066405_1067265
what's that supposed to indicate when a character is lying down or looking up ? 1067465_1070765
yeah ? 1072545_1072725
submission or passivity . 1073365_1074305
right submission submission passivity that's what Goffman argued too . 1074865_1078425
so let me show you examples of this . 1079285_1080685
this is from Goffman's book okay this is a little bit old and I &~pho photocopied it right from the book so it's a little fuzzy but it's for a suit a man's suit . 1082205_1090585
&=laughs:multiple you know there's some sex going on here obviously her skirt's all the way up by her leg but she's lying down with her hand out to him he's standing up looking at her it's kinda hard to figure out what what this corresponds to in real life but anyway &-uh Goffman uses it . 1094075_1106595
it says &{l=READING some men are suited for games and some men are just better suited . 1106735_1110195
&}l=READING so it's for a suit . 1110615_1111135
example lying down or looking up from Goffman's &-um Goffman's collection . 1111875_1116715
I found a more modern one by opening up about two or three women's magazines this is for cigarettes obviously same basic idea lying down looking up . 1117535_1130035
(0.5) okay the next one smiling . 1130535_1137975
women are disproportionately shown smiling +... 1139175_1141095
according to Goffman . 1144055_1145235
they can be shown smiling at men or just smiling in general or smiling for ads where you you wouldn't think somebody would necessarily smile . 1146675_1157195
here's &-um Goffman's example . 1157875_1160355
this is for a man's cologne . 1161655_1162755
the woman is sort_of looking approvingly at him smiling . 1165075_1167355
(0.5) that was Goffman's . 1172735_1173975
here's a more recent one that I found . 1174935_1176635
&-um this is an ad for breast augmentation . 1178255_1181535
and she's talking about how it's her choice and all this kinda stuff well it's really about surgery which you might think would be associated with a picture of somebody serious &-um but she's even smiling in this one . 1182735_1193995
(0.5) okay my favorite part here is pet peeve people who pressure you into doing things . 1195255_1201895
so anyway . 1204165_1204825
okay what's next ? 1206765_1207725
Goffman said the next characteristic that comes up a_lot is that women tend to be portrayed in childlike or whimsical poses . 1208265_1214265
(0.8) and really most of this comes out in nonverbal body language . 1214965_1225925
what is childlike or whimsical ? 1226085_1227305
here's Goffman's example . 1227985_1229585
it's obviously &~a an ad for socks women's socks . 1231675_1235455
but it's the way the feet are crossed in sort_of a shy childlike pose . 1236275_1239215
and here's my more recent example of this . 1239655_1243695
it's for Hanes underwear . 1245075_1246375
but it's the pose again that's meant to be sort_of childlike +... 1247155_1249715
the next one is a little bit more complex . 1254875_1257455
Goffman called it licensed withdrawal . 1258445_1260325
(0.13) this is &~wha what you might look at as expressions of shyness . 1273725_1276765
&-um Goffman also called it women sort_of getting &-um permission from the camera end to withdraw themselves emotionally from the action . 1280345_1289145
they're showing expressions of emotion (0.7) it may be better understood when I show you images of it . 1291525_1302425
&-um the woman is shown kind of withdrawing from the action but &~res she's responding to the action but she's not carrying it forth . 1304495_1309995
and often it comes out in this sort_of &~sh of what appears to be shyness but it's like withdrawal from the situation . 1311015_1317055
here's Goffman's example . 1317595_1318555
it's for a hand cream &{l=READING who's thirty and who's twenty two ? 1319975_1323135
&}l=READING so supposedly their hands are supposed to +//. 1323855_1327395
the thirty year+old's hand isn't all wrinkled yet thanks to the hand cream . 1327575_1330315
but even though it's for hands you know they're sort_of they're putting their hands up over their face and they're giggling at something . 1330925_1337585
&-um and they're not actually talking to the viewer they're not &-uh pushing forth the action themselves . 1338305_1344125
a more recent version of this is this ad for nail polish . 1344965_1350385
where again she's sort_of responding to something she's not looking at the camera she's withdrawing from the situation by kind of covering up her face . 1351835_1359795
(0.10) &-uh the next one is Goffman said gleeful . 1361355_1371995
women are often shown not just happy or approving but absolutely gleeful . 1372795_1376655
in situations that wouldn't normally provoke glee . 1379325_1382245
for example buying a new toaster . 1383085_1387465
&=laughs:multiple I think that one's kind_of funny too . 1390165_1395385
it's kinda hard to see but here's the new popup toaster . 1395865_1398105
and she's you know delighted that she's got the popup toaster . 1399305_1402145
so this is what Goffman was saying was you_know glee not just happiness but utter glee . 1402245_1406525
and a more recent example is this cigarette ad where yeah it looks like everybody's happy the woman is especially kind_of out_of her mind happy . 1408695_1418515
&-um you know popping a Christmas tree in the car . 1419015_1422995
so it's just this expression of glee . 1423795_1425135
(0.6) okay . 1427115_1431675
number six women often shown hiding behind objects . 1432175_1435275
(0.10) and some of these have kind_of a veillike quality to them the object she's hiding behind goes right up above her nose and she peeks out from the top of it . 1445715_1452395
Goffman's example is also a cigarette ad . 1453315_1456875
I think this woman looks like &-um +... 1459155_1460595
is it Malcolm McDowell who's in &-uh A Clockwork Orange ? 1461715_1466855
you ever see this movie ? 1467375_1468195
he's got these false eyelashes that go like that . 1468695_1470895
he's kinda strange looking . 1471655_1472595
but anyway you know this is from the mid seventies and she's peeking out over the cigarettes . 1472655_1477075
<you know that's an> example of hiding behind something . 1477695_1479355
here's a more recent one . 1480375_1481395
it's JC Penney . 1482515_1483155
this is really veil looking . 1483775_1484975
it's like she's holding it up as a veil hiding behind it +... 1486015_1488215
okay and finally Goffman says when women and men are shown together very frequently the men are in charge . 1491535_1498395
now what does that mean ? 1498495_1499095
it can mean leading the woman +... 1502195_1504655
doing something to her or leading the action +... 1509015_1513375
so either he's leading her bringing her some place pointing something out to her teaching her he's doing something to her and she's receiving that you know or he's leading the action and she's kind_of watching . 1516495_1527495
&-um his example is I don't remember what this ad is for he's got it in the text of his book but not right under the ad . 1528995_1538435
but it's just the man is telling her he's informing the woman . 1538815_1541195
and then a more recent version +... 1543975_1545735
is for you know it's meant to be playful but still he's doing the action she's the recipient of the action . 1548495_1555775
okay so these are what Goffman came up with as characteristics of advertising with women print ads . 1557965_1565165
so your question would logically be okay so what's gone on since nineteen seventy nine ? 1565725_1569785
well Mian Kang who used to be a grad student here at the &~Universi here in the Comm Studies Department did a replication . 1570685_1580245
&-um it was Goffman's Gender Analysis Updated . 1581405_1584485
whoops sorry . 1584905_1585285
(0.7) from nineteen seventy nine through ninety six I think ninety five ninety six . 1592195_1596035
(0.5) basically what she found was no significant change . 1596815_1605895
so she used the same categories she did the a content analysis of print ads and really over the &~o generally no significant change . 1607875_1617355
one thing just if you're interested &-uh that she found was more women shown in licensed withdrawal positions . 1617795_1623015
so more likely to be sort_of responding emotionally but not to the camera . 1624075_1627335
and then she also had looked she added a an additional +... 1629055_1632175
additional coding &-um category . 1633975_1637155
which she called body display +... 1637935_1639075
where she's looking at how much skin is shown basically . 1642675_1644935
Goffman didn't look at this . 1645885_1646545
and Kang showed that yeah there's a_lot_o(f) body display . 1648845_1652005
&=laughs okay so that's just she updated it no real significant change so even up until the early to mid nineties women are still being portrayed with these same sorts of &-um characteristics . 1653565_1662205
and there's a_lot_o(f) body a_lot_o(f) skin shown as well . 1662765_1665565
(0.4) okay so that's something on advertisement advertising but what about portrayals in entertainment ? 1670275_1674935
(0.9) I'm gonna summarize the research for you by domain . 1680615_1691175
one is age . 1691495_1692235
what do content analyses say about women and men's age in portrayals ? 1693395_1698735
in &-uh entertainment TV entertainment . 1699355_1700755
(0.4) now keep in mind with age when you're coding it you don't actually necessarily have the age of the character you just have to make a judgment when you look at them . 1701475_1712215
so these are coded by you know coder's judgments . 1712955_1715615
you look at somebody they've got wrinkles all over they've got wiry gray hair you probably put them maybe above sixty seventy eighty . 1716025_1723725
there's gonna be some leeway . 1724125_1725145
so on average how are females' ages coded compared to males ? 1726385_1730765
on average females ten years younger than males . 1731045_1739225
females on average appear to be ten years younger than males . 1741135_1744295
(0.7) you could probably chalk this up to the overabundance of young you know sort_of &~s &-uh sex object roles +... 1745435_1759395
so on average females younger than males . 1759615_1765695
what about relationship status ? 1766795_1768315
you know you get background of characters when you're learning about a character in an entertainment portrayal . 1769775_1776135
how are they defined ? 1776595_1779815
what's their relationship status ? 1780035_1781375
females more likely to be identified +... 1782795_1790155
as involved . 1794475_1795115
that could mean in a relationship or married . 1795515_1797535
so you could look at this the other way . 1803295_1804615
men are less likely to be identified by their relationship status . 1805215_1808415
in some way this makes sense (be)cause we still live in a culture where women's titles reflect their relationship status but men's don't . 1808795_1817775
Miss versus Mrs a man is Mister_for his entire life . 1818295_1821855
so even in media portrayals we get this definition of a woman by her relationship status more so than we get for men . 1822455_1829495
we find out that she's married she's involved or she's single for the man we may just know his job and they may not give us information about his relationship status . 1829965_1837285
okay attire . 1839945_1840745
what are they wearing ? 1841465_1842165
(0.9) Davis nineteen eighty six . 1845345_1853725
a slightly older study . 1855605_1856905
what Davis wanted to look at was whether women and men were dressed to a different degree provocatively . 1858895_1863775
so how did Davis define provocatively ? 1865215_1866835
either showing the body shape or showing skin . 1867415_1871715
&-um for example swimwear shorts tight clothing these are all things that were &~s meant to be provocative . 1873375_1878795
and Davis found that women four times more likely to be dressed provocatively . 1879685_1889265
(0.8) now you may expect this to be similar or even stronger now with the way women on prime time programming are dressed even in a professional realm like the Ally McBeal type portrayal or the Melrose &~P Place portrayal where the jacket's there but the skirt cuts off just at &~th at the highest possible point it can cut off you could call that provocative as well . 1897805_1921445
even though it's professional . 1921985_1922705
so women more likely to be dressed provocatively and finally what about occupations ? 1923695_1927655
(0.13) women are identified as being employed much less often than men . 1933455_1948035
(0.6) now again you can look at this as you know we live in a world where producers are conceptualizing women as dependent on men not likely to be employed and so on . 1954475_1967835
remember though you can also look at it as men's characters may be disproportionately shown as being employed that is we don't know how to categorize a man unless we know his job in this country . 1968655_1978715
so you have to find out what he does for a living . 1979295_1981255
that is his identity . 1981515_1982375
so men reading this could look at it and go well you may think that's negative a negative portrayal of women but maybe it's a negative portrayal of men too . 1983145_1989165
you gotta know your job or else you're not you know you're not a real man unless we know exactly what your job is and we can put you in some mental category . 1989965_1996565
okay so these are some general trends in portrayals of women relative to men . 1997625_2005265
(0.6) now what about effects of exposure ? 2010445_2012145
and I'm gonna talk about a couple studies in more depth here . 2012565_2015005
(0.16) okay the first one is a study by Morgan . 2015385_2032485
and the study's on television and adolescent sex role stereotypes . 2035655_2039135
(0.11) sixth through tenth grade . 2041015_2052315
and the study's longitudinal . 2055475_2057095
let's see two years I believe . 2059535_2061275
so Morgan followed sixth through tenth graders for two years until they were eighth through twelfth grade . 2064405_2069965
&~w females and males . 2070625_2073085
and what Morgan wanted to see was Morgan was one of these cultivation researchers by the way Michael Morgan what he wanted to see was whether exposure early on you know when they were in sixth seventh eighth ninth and tenth grade predicted their sex role stereotyping two years later . 2075565_2095105
so does earlier viewing predict later stereotyping ? 2096205_2099165
(0.5) let me give you a little more detail here . 2104365_2105585
what they wanted to know was does earlier what he wanted to know was does earlier TV viewing predict later sex role stereotypes ? 2106785_2114145
&-um but also does earlier &~se sex role stereotyping predict later viewing ? 2114745_2120005
this is kinda like these Huesman studies I mentioned to you where if you're gonna follow something longitudinally you can make a stronger causal argument than if you're just doing crosssectional one time only research if you can show that something that happened earlier is related to something that happened later . 2120395_2136115
this is one of our conditions of causality it's a necessary but insufficient condition but it's necessary . 2136555_2141595
so you know does early violence viewing is it related to later aggression ? 2142305_2148465
but one of the things you gotta show is that early aggression is not related to later violence viewing because &~tha what that indicates is that in this case with sex role stereotyping that people with who already had sex role stereotypes just happened to seek out more TV to begin with . 2148885_2164365
and it's not that TV is causing sex role stereotypes . 2164745_2166825
so this is what they gotta look at here . 2167725_2169325
&-uh for stereotyping just to give you an indication of what kind of questions these kids were asked &-um five questions and a &~sp just to give you an example of how explicit these are . 2170555_2180355
they give them true or false questions and one is true or false by nature women are happiest when they are making a home and caring for children . 2180955_2187455
so they're pretty explicit you know traditional gender stereotype questions . 2188275_2192395
so what are the findings ? 2193895_2194855
(0.6) now we're looking at correlations between earlier viewing and later sexism . 2201625_2205605
and this is controlling for earlier sexism +... 2206625_2209585
the first is for girls earlier viewing predicted later sexism what they would expect . 2212805_2218165
(0.15) just so you know the size of this correlation's R equals point one four . 2234395_2237295
significant ? 2238295_2238675
it was but not super huge . 2239215_2241355
(0.5) &~i in contrast for boys earlier sexism predicted later viewing . 2242855_2252095
(0.6) and here the correlation's point one five . 2256715_2260575
(0.11) so in other words for girls those who watched more TV earlier in the study had higher sexism scores later . 2271545_2278565
but we didn't have the same thing for boys . 2279325_2281525
early viewing didn't predict later sexism for boys and for boys in fact earlier sexism predicted later viewing . 2281965_2287365
so any ideas on how to explain this this difference ? 2288565_2292325
(0.15) finding with the girls is what Morgan expected . 2309035_2311255
how might you explain the finding with the boys ? 2312395_2314035
(0.14) just to let you know I don't have a right answer floating around in my mind Morgan didn't really know how to explain it . 2320135_2333895
yeah ? 2334755_2334875
he uses gratifications ?
how ? 2337495_2337715
what would you . 2337815_2338235
&-um if you're &~see if they already have these attitudes they'll seek out things that further them ? 2338495_2343375
so earlier sexism &~pu sexism predicts later viewing that's basically what Morgan would say . 2343895_2352515
you know well if there's a causal link between early sexism and later viewing since TV tends to be gender traditional that for boys already seeing the world in a somewhat sexist way predicts seeking out more TV . 2352705_2369445
alright but you know why wouldn't it work that way for girls too ? 2370925_2373025
you know why wouldn't earlier sexism predict later viewing ? 2373285_2375485
if they're already more sexist they should be more willing to see to be exposed to this content . 2375705_2381465
they did use Morgan used a bunch of different controls like you know socioeconomic status things like that that that also influence how much you view . 2383085_2392045
but you know you always wanna keep in your mind earlier sexism predicts later viewing for boys you know are are sexist boys less likely to have friends ? 2392865_2402965
and so they end up watching more TV (be)cause they're not hanging out with their friends ? 2403115_2406195
you know there're all sorts of possible explanations we don't know . 2406435_2409455
whereas sexist girls may have a_lot_o(f) friends because they're fitting in with this you know a a desired stereotype for them . 2410215_2415715
you know the way they define sexism was sort_of antifemale it wasn't antimale . 2416955_2420495
it was you know women don't have ambition women can't do certain things . 2421055_2425735
so for a girl to believe in that she may be agreeable to others . 2426055_2430075
for a boy to believe in that you know he maybe mean to girls . 2430395_2433215
we don't know . 2433575_2433995
I I actually don't know the answer to this and Morgan doesn't really either . 2434435_2437015
&-um Morgan's &~ex saying if there is a relationship a causal relationship between early sexism and later viewing &~i it's probably a uses and gratifications kind of explanation . 2437655_2446615
but there could be other ones that we we can't tell for certain from this study . 2447095_2450775
okay . 2452515_2453195
so there's one (0.7) and that one's on beliefs . 2453755_2463195
there's another one the second one I wanna mention is Jennings Geis and Brown and this is on behaviors . 2463715_2469835
(0.15) don't write this down but just so you know the title is The Influence of Television Commercials on Women's Self_Confidence and Independent Judgment . 2485505_2492045
so how do you measure self-confidence behaviorally ? 2493185_2496565
and how do you measure independent judgment that is not going with the crowd ? 2496925_2500585
well this is &-uh what &~Jen this is the challenge that Jennings et_al had &-um had +... 2501825_2508005
I'm gonna give you the independent variables and the dependent variables . 2509445_2511885
the independent variables (0.7) was you could look at it as sex role portrayals traditional versus nontraditional . 2512725_2532125
(0.5) that's role portrayals in commercials traditional versus nontraditional . 2538315_2541235
well &~wha what did they do ? 2541495_2542275
they took four commercials that were current at the time with traditional sex roles . 2543695_2550335
and they remade them with the sex roles reversed . 2550695_2554155
so the first one was &-uh how to handle a hungry man . 2554615_2558075
it was like a TV dinner . 2558335_2559195
they reversed it so then it was about how to handle a hungry woman and the man's trying to give her enough food . 2560055_2564295
&-uh wine at a bar she orders his brand (be)cause he knows wine the sex role reversal was she's the one who knows the wine and so he orders her brand . 2564975_2573195
&-uh third was Stove Top stuffing she didn't realize that he preferred it over potatoes . 2574215_2577955
the reversal is he didn't realize she preferred it . 2578475_2581175
and then another package dinner the idea is &{l=READING now an exotic meal can be made from a package . 2581615_2586135
&}l=READING so the woman's usually making it for the man traditionally this reversed the roles . 2586635_2589595
so in one condition they watched the four commercials in their traditional form in the other condition they watched the four commercials with the sex roles reversed +... 2590895_2597935
then +...
here's the the interesting part . 2603755_2605795
what were the dependent measures ? 2605955_2606995
(0.5) dependent variables were two tasks . 2608595_2612855
two tasks that subjects hadta perform . 2614955_2617535
the subjects here are women by the way . 2620025_2621625
(0.10) one is rating cartoons for funniness . 2624725_2634825
this is the independent judgment . 2639025_2641405
and I'll explain to you how they did this . 2642345_2643465
(0.12) first they had a a complete completely separate group of people rate a bunch of cartoons on how funny they were . 2654545_2660345
and let's say there's a score of one to six . 2661245_2664925
one meaning not funny at all six meaning very very funny . 2665725_2668125
and then they picked out the cartoons that were really seen by this previous group of women as very very funny and they picked the ones out that were really seen as not funny at all . 2668685_2677425
so they had some pretty &-um pretty extreme ratings . 2677765_2681265
pretty extreme cartoons . 2681385_2682685
some that were &~pre previously rated as very funny some not funny at all . 2683185_2686265
then with the subjects in this study what they did was had them rate the same cartoons . 2686905_2691925
and then they put up what they call bogus feedback on the chalkboard in the room . 2692945_2697345
and all that meant was they showed the women what the previous subjects had rated . 2698285_2703265
&-um what their ratings their mean ratings were . 2704645_2706425
but they lied with &-uh with the cartoons that were rated you know five point five that were really funny they gave that they lied and said that was maybe a one point five . 2706495_2715175
so it's bogus feedback . 2716055_2717055
&~the &~the these women in the study are &~s thinking they're reading it and odds are they're gonna think it's funny as well if this previous group thought it was funny but they look up at the board and they see that <this previous> this previous group rated it only a one point five . 2717235_2728355
so Jennings et_al thought that independent judgment should make it more likely independence of judgment means you're more likely to not pay attention to these &~pri previous &~reading ratings and rate it as funny as you think it is . 2729155_2742455
so they gave it a one point five that's stupid I think it's really funny . 2743595_2746375
lack of this independence should lead the women to go boy I think it's funny but but they only gave it a one point five I'll rate it lower . 2746975_2753915
okay so it's going with the crowd . 2754955_2756115
so that's the first task . 2757455_2758875
the second task +... 2759875_2761015
is this public speaking task (0.4) and by the way the order of these two is rotated so half the women did public speaking first and then the cartoons the other &~d half did the cartoons and then the public speaking . 2763615_2776795
with the public speaking task +... 2777875_2779155
the women came into a room and they were told now we want you to give a two minute speech on yourself . 2782415_2788135
which usually strikes fear into the heart hearts of most people . 2790435_2793255
&-um and they had a couple minutes to prepare and then they hadta go out in front of a group of people and give a two minute speech on themselves . 2794935_2801915
now the group of people in the audience were instructed to rate each woman on how self-confident she seemed . 2802675_2810135
so if she was shaking all over the place if she was saying &-um ah if she looked like she was about to cry because she was so nervous they would rate her low on self-confidence . 2811385_2818745
so they were really rating her nonverbal her nonverbals@n you know how confident she seems . 2819245_2823625
and they're blind to condition that is they don't know whether the woman speaking saw the traditional ads or the nontraditional ads they're just rating her &~perci &~the their perceived self-confidence so how self-confident she looks . 2824125_2835905
so what do we find ? 2837115_2839815
(0.14) first thing was well okay let me just stick it right here . 2847035_2857475
women who viewed the nontraditional ads first of all were more independent in their judgment . 2858015_2862575
(0.21) they were significantly more independent in their judgment that is their ratings were closer to the true ratings that the other group had given which they didn't receive remember ? 2884245_2893405
it's just that these these cartoons were generally perceived as funny . 2894125_2896785
so the women in the study reported that they thought that they were generally funny . 2897205_2901525
&-um when they saw the nontraditional ads when they saw the traditional they rated them more like the ratings that they saw written up on the board . 2902645_2911445
so there's some evidence that they were a little more independent in their judgment they rated the cartoons more along the lines of what they really thought and less along the lines of what the other people had had supposedly rated them as being . 2911965_2922165
moreover they were also perceived as being more self-confident . 2922865_2928905
(0.7) now again keep in mind (0.5) that lemme give you a a scale here for self-confidence . 2935985_2945605
one to five and the means are three point thirty eight versus two point seven three . 2946545_2952685
so it's not a huge difference but it's significantly different . 2953385_2955705
the ones who saw the nontraditional ads more self-confident exuded more self-confidence than the ones who saw the traditional ads . 2957145_2964785
so my point here is that it's a subtle effect but it's a powerful effect . 2966005_2973265
they're not reporting feeling more self-confident they're actually judged by a group of raters as more self-confident +... 2973945_2978985
so think about you know where these kinds of things could be operating in the real world . 2982775_2987915
you go to a job interview you're sitting in the waiting room and there're a bunch of magazines out there and you're poring through them does it mean that if you're seeing traditional ads &~yo you're gonna be less self-confident in your interview ? 2989615_3003475
than you would be if you saw nontraditional ads ? 3004515_3006455
I don't know . 3007315_3007795
but it's something to think about . 3008455_3009555
I mean this particular study we can think about ways that it would be externally valid even though it's an experiment and it's not necessarily going to be as externally valid as a survey &-um well as a survey . 3009715_3021615
but there really are situations where exposure to media could affect your behavior in a situation where you're expected to exude self-confidence . 3023275_3032595
yeah ? 3032935_3032995
as far as this &-um like slide is concerned would this have anything to do with like like the way they do it is like they show you something and then like obviously like they prime it to you and you're kind of thinking about it and isn't that maybe the reason for the results ? 3033745_3046505
is that like in general maybe like it doesn't have as great of effect as like right after it's shown to you ? 3047265_3054085
it doesn't necessarily affect your life constantly but like you know for ten or fifteen minutes after you see it it will ? 3054705_3059845
yeah <I think> I think that's probably the best explanation for the process underlying this is a priming one . 3060185_3064985
&-um they may forget it . 3066005_3067265
and it's short term you know the authors themselves say this is a short term effect . 3067885_3071525
you know &~o &~o odds are women it's you know when you've got +//. 3071985_3074405
and I'll talk about schemes in a moment when you've got your world view built up four ads may prime you know more self-confident or more independent behaviors for a while . 3074545_3086365
but four ads are not likely to change your world view . 3086535_3088815
so it's not really that these women suddenly went I am powerful . 3089515_3092915
it's that somehow that was primed in +//. 3094435_3096815
it's not like they went I am powerful and I have learned this and now I will always have this with me . 3096975_3100735
&-um it probably lasted a short time and then it went away . 3101255_3104455
is that what you're asking ? 3104875_3105715
yeah kinda just that &-um that they're basing like the results on like how this affects women you know in general I would think +/. 3107175_3115975
yeah +/.
+, on like something that's probably having to do with like priming rather than like a long term anything . 3117655_3122655
+, ⌈ yeah ⌉ +/. 3124435_3124555
+, ⌊ like whether ⌋ or not this affects like women on the whole like women see themselves as this this and that +/. 3124555_3129635
+, right +/.
+, because of ads .
yeah I think that's a good point &~w we do have to look at this as short term . 3129935_3133475
and it's probably priming that's responsible for it . 3133885_3136325
now the question is you know are there situations where even this kind_of short term effect would actually affect some major event in your life like how you behaved at &-um you know a job interview ? 3136665_3147605
it may . 3148025_3148545
then again if you're home and you're not gonna do anything after this once those thoughts are gone it may not have any effect . 3148805_3155005
&-um they're really not Jennings et_al really didn't make conclusions like you know this has a profound effect on women for a long time . 3155655_3165415
they said let's be honest here this is a short term effect . 3165795_3168875
but if you're exposed to these images regularly throughout the day maybe they do affect you know your behavior &~mayb maybe they affect how other people see you . 3169495_3177795
just so you know in this same story +//. 3178215_3179855
or the same study &-um they later found that exposing women to nontraditional portrayals versus traditional portrayals made them write different essays concerning where they wanted to be in ten years . 3179905_3191285
and again you can call this a priming effect . 3192125_3193725
&-um those who were exposed to the traditional ads I'm sorry the traditional portrayals in the second part of the study were less ambitious about &~whe where they were gonna be in ten years . 3194505_3204605
those exposed to the nontraditional ones wrote things like you know I'm gonna be the president of a company you know they wrote more ambitious things . 3204935_3212395
now again does that mean that these portrayals you know four minutes of portrayals changed these women's aspirations for what they wanted to do in life ? 3212595_3222715
probably not . 3222835_3223695
it probably was a priming effect that probably went away . 3224175_3226535
but again the question is when you're exposed day in and day out through magazines through television &-um you know you're catching a portrayal at the airport while you're waiting for a plane . 3226825_3235785
that counts too . 3235965_3236565
so how does this impact on people's daily lives ? 3237325_3240825
that's something that Jennings et_al aren't able to look at because they just did one study at one point in time . 3241765_3247845
okay &-um I don't wanna leave men out so what about men ? 3249545_3254365
(0.11) well lemme tell you something . 3265795_3266975
there's not a whole lot o(f) research on men more and more people are getting interested in studying men but it's just one of these sort_of truisms of the research world people like to study the groups who aren't portrayed so much . 3268015_3280175
so if there're a_lot_of men oh they're fine we don't need to study them . 3280615_3283335
but now researchers are starting to study men and asking this question that I brought up before we may think that men are portrayed in respect that is representing all the roles that they occupy in real life . 3283905_3297585
but it's also possible that they're not . 3298105_3299465
you know you're probably more likely to see a male doctor or lawyer as a character than you are a male postal worker as a character . 3300785_3307045
so what does research say about men ? 3307465_3309445
well <when a> when a group is beginning to be studied very often the first people who start to describe portrayals of that group aren't social scientists . 3311585_3321345
&~wha what often happens is that feminist theorists cultural theorists critical studies American culture studies people will look at portrayals and describe what they think is going on . 3321945_3334625
and then social scientists will come by and say let's test if this is really happening . 3334905_3338725
so with men we're really at the stage now where most of the writing about this is done by feminist theorists and and cultural theorists . 3339035_3346455
and this guy Strate has written about the myth of masculinity (0.5) in beer commercials . 3347135_3360335
(0.10) Strate argues that the myth of masculinity that is what masculinity is supposed to be is embodied in the beer commercial . 3371665_3378165
so tell me what do you see in beer commercials ? 3379985_3381665
how are men portrayed ? 3381745_3382565
&=laughs (0.4) what are they usually doing ? 3383305_3388625
how are they interacting ? 3389425_3390425
just tell me how are men portrayed in beer commercials ? 3391785_3394425
⌈ working ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you've ⌋ never seen a beer commercial ? 3403775_3404875
working or watching sports . 3404955_3405975
working or watching sports . 3406695_3407635
right it's Miller time was the whole idea that once you're off work now it's time for beer . 3408435_3412335
so working hard watching sports . 3412515_3414195
yeah ? 3414475_3414555
male bonding like just a bunch of guys sitting together like screaming xxx . 3415255_3417855
okay male bonding it's like mostly all men . 3418255_3422115
when there are women what's the relationship between the men and the women ? 3422275_3425355
(0.4) do they show a bunch of gay guys sitting around with their female friends ? 3427015_3431595
&=laughs:multiple .
⌈ women are serving the beer ⌉ . 3432725_3433845
⌊ right you're laughing because ⌋ it's so not the the typical beer commercial right ? 3433845_3436925
the women are usually maybe scantily clad it's a very heterosexual kind of image this is what Strate is arguing . 3437225_3442765
in fact Strate says that in beer commercials the whole idea of masculinity revolves around the theme of challenge . 3443005_3449525
(0.6) alright ? 3452465_3455965
sports challenge . 3456125_3456845
they're playing a game or they're watching a game or they're betting against each_other somehow . 3458505_3462325
women challenge . 3462845_3463725
you know vying for the attention of women although when you've got the right beer it's usually not hard . 3464965_3468905
&=laughs:multiple &-um climbing the corporate ladder you brought this up as well . 3469665_3473205
and Strate goes so far as to argue that this supports the stereotype of man as hunter . 3474805_3478645
man as hunter woman as gatherer . 3479945_3482005
okay now Strate's not doing social scientific research to try to quantify this . 3483935_3488715
so this is a different way of looking at it . 3489215_3490755
but he's arguing that beer commercials show this myth of masculinity man as hunter man as you know &-uh meeting some kind of challenge . 3491055_3498715
and if you think about it it's kind_of ironic that that would go along with beer . 3499355_3503235
because how is beer supposed to help you meet a challenge ? 3504535_3507415
you know if anything in the real world it holds you back . 3508595_3510715
&-um okay . 3512395_3513095
so oh I &~d this brings up one other thing I just wanted to mention I'm seeing these new Virginia Slims ads for for women you know they they aim the cigarette at women . 3513995_3522135
and they're all about finding your voice and it's about the eyes are are the window to the soul but the voice shows the spirit find your voice . 3523035_3530895
&-um and it's about you know sort_of stating who you are through this cigarette . 3531855_3537775
but I just think it's funny because people who smoke a_lot as they get older can get a really raggedy sounding voice &=laughs so again it's like what's really the connection between finding your voice and smoking cigarettes ? 3537795_3548635
what's the connection between making meeting a challenge and drinking beer ? 3548775_3551935
&-um if anything these products would would hold you back from that . 3552595_3555635
so this is one view of men . 3556275_3557735
another view is Garst and Bodenhausen +... 3558915_3564815
looking at effects of advertising on men's gender role attitudes . 3565635_3569275
(0.21) in this study they had male subjects they're all males view either traditional masculine ads or androgynous ads . 3590635_3600615
so in the traditional masculine the man is either forceful or he's the leader &-um he's the less emotional one you know they were trying to embody the different aspects of stereotypes of men . 3602695_3615575
so traditional masculine versus androgynous . 3616215_3618595
and then they measured these men's sex role attitudes afterward +... 3620005_3622625
now here's something interesting . 3623585_3627825
if you think about that Archie Bunker study . 3628725_3633385
Archie Bunker's bigotry . 3634365_3635205
you might expect that those who already had the most traditional sex roles that they would come away from seeing the traditional sex role ads feeling especially strongly about traditional sex roles . 3636235_3648655
especially likely to espouse them . 3649535_3650715
whereas those who were the least traditional initially would come away from the androgynous ads feeling most like you know they see the world in androgynous terms . 3651115_3662675
and and that they shouldn't come away from the &-uh androgynous men should also come away from the traditional sexual ads &~r you know rejecting those messages . 3663305_3671005
but what the authors found here was instead that men who were least traditional to begin with they pretested them (0.7) changed the most toward traditionalism (0.8) after viewing traditional ads . 3671585_3701565
men who &~ha initially had been least traditional espoused more traditional attitudes than any other group after exposure to the traditional ads . 3705585_3712725
although they continued to endorse relatively nontraditional views after &~exposu after exposure to the androgynous ads . 3715185_3721005
so the nontraditional men the ones who were initially nontraditional exposure to the androgynous ads you know resulted in basically the same views they hadta begin with . 3721425_3730805
but exposure to the traditional ads made them actually the most traditional group afterward . 3732115_3736235
so they changed the most . 3736995_3738175
whereas the men who were initially had been traditional were still relatively traditional but not as much as the men who had initially been nontraditional . 3738715_3744355
so there's some evidence that the least traditional men were the most sort of changed over by these ads . 3744915_3751255
now how how might you explain this kind of finding +..? 3752815_3755015
the authors incidentally explained it as gender role advertising teaches nontraditional men to be traditional . 3757965_3767165
it's damaging . 3769545_3770085
you know it's not +//. 3770765_3771645
it's damaging because these men who were already you know less likely to be gender bigoted now were you know especially gender bigoted . 3771905_3780605
&-uh can you think of any other reason why they would find what they found in this study ? 3781945_3784945
(0.15) what do you think the mechanism is underlying this ? 3799835_3802215
social learning ? 3802995_3804135
(0.4) cultivation ? 3807515_3808855
priming ? 3810395_3811035
(0.5) what kind of study does this sound like ? 3811375_3818355
a social learning study a priming study a cultivation study ? 3818435_3821895
(0.8) yes ? 3831735_3832035
I'd say social learning or cultivation . 3832215_3834155
why not priming ? 3834575_3836155
(0.4) .
well I guess I mean it depends on how long your effects are lasting if they're only feeling this way for thirty minutes then you could say priming but <if the effects> last xxx expecting to be something more like cultivation and xxx or something . 3839715_3852695
yeah ? 3853195_3861555
you <go ahead> .
if it was priming wouldn't the men who had the most traditional roles be I mean because they have the most networks already be whereas the more traditional +/. 3854255_3863295
yeah +/.
+, xxx .
<this is> this is certainly what you'd expect from a priming perspective . 3865075_3868335
that's right that's what you'd expect . 3868915_3870075
this doesn't seem to fit in with priming . 3870335_3871875
but you know what ? 3872295_3872875
these authors didn't follow up the findings they only looked at immediate findings right afterward . 3873215_3878135
so we don't actually know . 3878635_3879855
we can't really distinguish if it's social learning or priming if it's priming it's going in a different direction than we would expect . 3880675_3885855
if it's social learning as they argue it would help if they had had some kind of follow+up measures to see if there was some difference later on . 3885895_3894235
because when you measure it right afterward you know how do I know the difference in priming or social learning ? 3894915_3899435
priming is not going in the direction I'd expect it to but you can't go ooh it's not going in that direction let's just scrap our theory and switch to another one . 3899555_3906435
you know you're not supposed to do that anyway although sometimes people do . 3907105_3909885
&-um so anyway kinda hard to explain . 3910825_3912705
don't really know exactly why this happened . 3912965_3914265
not consistent with other kinds of priming findings . 3914705_3917365
&-um Garst and Bodenhausen's argument about &~n you know these nontraditional men learning to be traditional is just something <we're not gonna> &~under we're not gonna know whether or not that's really happening without some follow+up . 3918765_3929925
okay . 3930965_3931945
&-uh so +... 3932565_3933025
combatting negative effects ? 3936865_3937325
what are some considerations in this ? 3937585_3939665
(0.10) well we're thinking again about this issue that I brought up with ethnic portrayals . 3945525_3953205
what do you do to counteract any possible negative effects ? 3953885_3956325
and again negativity here is a value laden term . 3956885_3959265
you know I may be defining gender traditionalism as a negative effect you may not . 3960285_3964425
so how do we combat effects &-um that enforce gender stereotypes ? 3965085_3970465
well one issue one consideration that's very important (0.4) is schemas . 3971345_3982145
what are schemas ? 3982345_3983205
(0.10) we can describe schemas as ways of looking at the world (0.6) prototypes (0.4) schemas have been defined all sorts of different ways . 3992105_4007685
ways of looking at the world prototypes models you know what we define as typical . 4008965_4016825
what's typical ? 4017145_4017665
so a very common schema exercise is if I say to you describe a chair . 4018905_4023825
tell me what a chair has . 4025405_4026485
how do you describe a chair ? 4026665_4028205
what has it got ? 4028485_4029145
what features does it have ? 4029345_4030305
just shout (th)em out . 4031565_4032605
four legs . 4032945_4033985
four legs . 4033985_4034265
what else ? 4034705_4035205
a seat .
a seat . 4035925_4036865
what else ? 4037405_4037925
a back . 4038325_4039425
a back .
what's it made of ? 4039585_4040165
wood .
okay wood . 4040665_4041925
you know this is your schema of a chair . 4042065_4043405
now you know that a throne is also a chair a stool is also a chair a La_Z_Boy recliner is also a chair even though these things don't have four legs stool doesn't have a back they can be made of metal not wood but the point is that this four four legged seat with the back made of wood is your schema of a chair . 4043695_4061375
stereotypes are defined as schemas . 4062015_4066455
stereotypes are just schemas of people +... 4066715_4069715
there's types of schemas +... 4073065_4074525
so we develop schemas very very young . 4078005_4083665
and the fact that we bring schemas to what we're viewing +... 4084485_4088745
is going to influence what we take away from what we're viewing . 4091505_4094345
(0.4) and I'll just get through this quickly but &-um the importance here is that schemas have an impact on memory such that (0.4) when memory fades (0.5) people fill in schema consistent info . 4098935_4123955
when memory fades people fill in schema consistent info . 4126825_4129825
(0.10) for the last thing and I I promise I'll make this quick you can just write Cordua et_al . 4133065_4156725
&-um there's one study that demonstrates this with kids (0.4) Cordua McGraw and Drabman wanted to know how they could kind_of reverse very young children three to five +... 4146355_4161675
how they could reverse their stereotypes of men and women . 4164715_4167655
so they showed them a portrayal with a female doctor and a male nurse . 4168185_4174765
right after the portrayal +... 4176405_4178865
