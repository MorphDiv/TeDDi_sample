and the amount . 0_1600
have another little look at the numbers that I chose and see if you can see a pattern . 1600_6825
I'm not speaking about a pattern from this ratio to that ratio to that ratio . 6825_27935
I'm speaking about a pattern between ratios and amounts . 27935_31470
because I deliberately picked these numbers so that they would be relatively easy to work out . 31470_37928
so what numbers am I actually speaking of ? 37928_45551
I'm speaking of one to three which is two hundred . 45551_49038
eight to three, which was sixty six and two to five which I chose two hundred and ten . 49038_54588
okay ? 54588_56178
bobbie Jo ? 56178_56683
easily divisible by xxx . 56683_60436
exactly . 60436_61100
they are easily divisible by the ? 61100_63565
total number of blocks you used to create them . 63565_68973
eight and three is eleven, and eleven goes into ? 68973_72035
sixty six with no remainder . 72035_74565
one and three make ? 74565_75953
four, and four goes into two hundred nice and easily . 75953_79865
no remainder . 79865_80576
two and five make seven, and I deliberately chose a multiple of seven so you wouldn't have thir(ty) twenty nine dollars and forty three cents or something like that . 80576_93056
which would have been okay because you've got a calculator there . 93056_97065
you could have handled it . 97065_98065
but to start with I chose something easy for you to work out . 98065_103968
so I want you to create for your friend a question and then swap books and see if they can do it . 103968_111463
so it would be better if you tried to create one they could do in their head without a calculator . 111463_117878
so try to maintain that relationship where the total number of boxes +... 117878_124435
xxx need a xxx . 124435_126315
no you don't need to restrict yourself to less than twelve . 126315_129220
you can have a ratio of twenty five to one if you want or +... 129220_133796
forty a hundred to one . 133796_136460
a hundred to one ? 136460_137418
yeah . 137418_138498
but then try and find a number that would be a multiple of a hundred and one . 138498_145130
two hundred and two . 145130_148430
xxx . 148430_149560
yeah . 149560_151355
all right . 151355_152241
xxx . 152241_155011
no . 155011_156186
but he might beat you up if it's too hard . 156186_157671
then again, Byron is pretty good at conflict resolutions so you might be lucky . 157671_166825
you three swap, you know, between you . 166825_174036
xxx this is good . 174036_185383
this is better . 185383_186256
did you have, um, something to give me, a tear off slip off the bottom of that letter ? 186256_192726
no . 192726_194168
okay . 194168_195025
there is one so maybe you might want to bring it back so I just know that I've seen it . 195025_199781
make up a question, swap it over . 199781_204440
so the question just has to be divide something . 204440_206613
do you have to restrict yourself to dollars ? 206613_208431
no . 208431_209501
no . 209501_209845
no . 209845_211055
you can have any kind of quantity you like . 211055_214728
kilometers, liters . 214728_217630
he got eight . 217630_220988
surfboards . 220988_222806
well what's one box xxx ? 222806_243175
so your question is to divide fifty five five dollars or &~fif +... 243175_248343
five hundred dollars in the ratio four to six which would have been nice as two to three wouldn't it, because we like a simple ratio . 248343_258301
okay . 258301_259016
so you've got ten boxes so how much is in one box ? 259016_261988
fifty . 261988_263828
fifty . 263828_264395
so you write fifty there . 264395_265666
one box is fifty dollars . 265666_267241
so four to six would be ? 267241_273563
four lots of fifty and six lots of fifty . 273563_279840
two hundred to three hundred . 279840_283356
and notice when you actually add those back up you still do get your five hundred . 283356_288445
have you finished doing your friend's question yet ? 288445_298263
no . 298263_298695
come on . 298695_302261
can one of you swap with Gary, please ? 302261_307091
so what are you dividing ? 307091_312205
eighty one dollars in the ratio six to three yeah that's good . 312205_314796
that's really good . 314796_315861
so nine into eighty one goes three times . 315861_320670
xxx very good . 320670_323308
do you want a hand ? 323308_330561
all right . 330561_332443
do you want Gary to do yours for you ? 332443_339946
xxx . 339946_341681
all right . 341681_342065
okay . 342065_344603
I prefer you to write somewhere five shares equals fifty while you're doing your working . 344603_356760
hmm ? 356760_359050
all right one hundred dollars xxx one to four . 359050_363145
yeah, okay . 363145_366545
but as I say, I'd still like to see somewhere five shares equals one hundred . 366545_371081
just to remind you that what you have to do is total up to start with . 371081_375711
all right . 375711_378088
you right ? 378088_382248
did you have you swapped ? 382248_384611
xxx . 384611_386563
still ? 386563_387778
okay . 387778_388795
yeah, we both wrote xxx . 388795_392793
she had xxx because I did one hundred and twenty one divided by sixty five . 392793_397315
one twenty one divided in the ratio . 397315_399715
you shouldn't really use the division sign like that because you're not dividing by, you're dividing in . 399715_405056
eighty one . 405056_407838
how do you +... 407838_408701
see ? 408701_409751
and that and that line with the two dots means divide by not divide in . 409751_414495
does nine go into one hundred and twenty one ? 414495_418616
xxx . 418616_419871
oh sixty five . 419871_423735
three . 423735_424798
xxx . 424798_431856
they were supposed to make one up that you could do in here . 431856_435501
in your head though not with your calculator not with +... 435501_440196
I was just doing xxx . 440196_442131
what do you have to do ? 442131_444733
she had to xxx . 444733_463403
are we all right then ? 463403_464745
is that just about enough time ? 464745_465840
how did you guys go ? 465840_472311
you got it right ? 472311_476816
pardon ? 476816_479303
xxx . 479303_481775
yeah . 481775_482135
xxx . 482135_483953
no . 483953_484345
I don't even know if I can find the marks out . 484345_496426
okay . 496426_497576
uh, let's see . 497576_505911
xxx four is twenty . 505911_507705
twenty five xxx . 507705_510985
twenty five to one dividing them both now wait a second, you're dividing them both by four aren't you ? 510985_524890
so isn't it fifty to one ? 524890_526185
are you making up the question or are you doing his question ? 526185_532305
so what so you have to divide four hundred and eight dollars in the ratio of two hundred to four . 532305_545021
okay . 545021_547511
so you actually have ? 547511_549326
two hundred and four shares so one share's eight . 549326_552078
no, that can't be right . 552078_554240
if two hundred and four shares is two four hundred and eight dollars, one share is only two dollars isn't it ? 554240_562846
because four hundred and eight divided by two hundred and four . 562846_567398
