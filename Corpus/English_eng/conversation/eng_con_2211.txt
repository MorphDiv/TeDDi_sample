Yea- . 388690_388880
And I don't mean that in a cynical way because like . 388780_390490
I totally believe that you have to keep trusting people now . 390840_393070
Like for a while I was really angry but . 393220_394800
yeah . 393330_393520

Filthy women say it . 416660_417610

And it happens from now on it's just like . 418070_420380
Well you know I trust him I I mean I would I hope . 420710_423490
But he could . 423310_424400
Who'd never do . 423610_424170
something like that but it might happen I I I could never s- see
yeah . 425060_425510
naive again . 428850_429670
mhm, that's what it is . 429860_431290
&=distortion And I think that's . 430560_431450
but . 431530_431720
Probably healthier and good but it's also kind of . 431531_433450
It is . 433060_433580
Bad it's like you lost your innocence or something and why do
Yes . 435810_436720
to you I mean &=breath if you could just live your whole life in
faithful kind of thing imagine the kind of person you would be this
just crazy and . 448530_449720

Not bittered by the co- cold+hearted world
It gets robbed &=distortion from you though like . 452230_454450

Right . 460650_460990
And like . 461250_461610
At first I like when he first told me I was just like David you
Right . 468460_468820
There is nothing else to talk about so . 468720_470070
Well I think in a way he was trying to tell you something by doing
You know ? 472470_472800
oh yeah xxx he's totally like unhappy by . 472940_475380
what was going on because he basically he wanted to be together . 475840_478680
Right . 478750_479120
He wanted like he needed a sexual relationship . 479280_481570
yeah . 481660_482020
And he needed me to be there and he needed to like someone
Right . 487630_487780
Right . 488660_488920
Like I was really hard on him I was always telling him that we
And so like . 494910_495730
He did me the biggest favor though and that's why like I got over
Really ? 501120_502030
Bec- yeah because . 501580_502730
&=lipsmack like at first it was really devastating . 503270_505380
Right . 505530_505840
Like it was so weird because the difference between Josh and him
Right . 511060_511310
Even though he wasn't as nearly . 511770_513390
As like I never had as m- many as deep feelings for him . 514090_517840
Right . 517870_518360
And it never like was as serious in many ways . 518300_520510
mhm . 520530_520890
But with David it was like I think because I had been in pain for
yeah &=distortion . 524910_525480
problems with my parents and problems with him and all this
yeah &=distortion . 528650_529590
That by the time he finally cheated on me I just realized . 529540_532370
Well at first I didn't because I I had to okay interesting so I
&=lipsmack he called me again like a day later or two and we talked
mhm . 541210_541630
mm . 544320_544460
Right . 546120_546520
And we could still be going out because I still loved him and I
How it happened because of the situation . 551030_553390
mhm . 553490_553790
But I I told him I still thought it was still shitty and horrible
mhm . 557520_557820
but that I could forgive him . 557940_558840
but it would take a long time to trust him &=distortion . 559100_560660
God Liz &=distortion that's so rational of you I can't believe you
No no no but it was though and I really did like forgive him . 562550_565370
mhm . 565350_565570
It was like you know I thought . 565470_566710
about the whole thing and I'm d- and besides many times I had
I just couldn't understand that part of him really well you know
xxx &=distorted . 572680_573030
At the time when he called me I wasn't there for him and he really
You know . 582150_582500
Wow . 582720_583160
so . 583080_583560
&=lipsmack then . 584400_585030
I had forgiven him but it still like just hurt it wasn't the same
Right . 589500_589830
And he's so far away and there are other people here that were
I didn't . 594710_595180
Want him to come live with me . 595460_597030
mhm . 597090_597420
I didn't want it and . 597370_598490
And he wanted that . 598510_599270
yeah and I had felt a_lot_of pressure and I didn't want to promise
Right . 604530_604830
And so finally we had another conversation a while ago and . 605190_608040
And &-uh &=breath it was actually a while ago it was in September or
