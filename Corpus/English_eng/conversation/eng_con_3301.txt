because the load has mass and then the effort . 754120_758030
you are the effort . 758030_759050
fulcrum's the pivot points, right ? 763290_768040
it's the part that doesn't move that much .
so let's look at some examples . 768040_769260
you know that you that uh, there are three classes of levers right ? 771130_781120
how many classes of levers are there ?
three . 781120_782120
three . 782120_790100
okay, so there's three classes of levers and they're determined the rule of classifying levers is what ?
oh, what's in the middle . 790100_792250
whatever is in the middle . 792250_795160
all you have to ask yourself is what's in the middle and that will help you to determine what kind of full what kind of lever it is . 795160_805090
okay, so check this out: here's a first class lever and we know that the word first begins with the letter ? 805090_812240
f . 818020_819050
so what's in the middle ? 819050_820070
fulcrum . 820070_821000
fulcrum . 821000_822010
that's right .
darn it ! 822010_825130
but I knew this one .
okay, let me ask you individually . 825130_829240
ken, what's in the middle of a first class lever ?
the fulcrum . 829240_830110
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding . 830110_832070
okay, so when you're on “who wants to be a millionaire” you can thank me . 832070_836120
second class lever what's in the middle ? 841110_842240
load . 842240_843290
okay hold up your l . 843290_850140
okay, we know that there's two digits in the number two .
one, two and if you pull them out and it makes an l and the l stands for ? 850140_855070
load . 855070_856150
load not loser . 856150_860030
not learner, load in this case .
how do you make the e ? 861030_862130
your l's like this miss dupont . 863190_865060
because whenever you fail your one step closer to learning what you need to learn . 873190_877260
now it's waxed, you guys because when it gets really warm in here it's kind of sagged a little bit, so i'll have to fix it later . 877260_882140
third class lever has what in the middle ? 886040_887240
effort . 887240_888150
effort . 888150_889010
okay, we know this is third class make an e . 889010_891020
effort . 891020_892000
effort . 892000_893000
a wheel barrel . 893000_894120
you can do that too, but this is easier for me . 894120_896090
that's easier for me . 897230_903120
okay, a broom is an example of one .
in fact let's look at some levers right now .
pliers, broom, and wheel barrow . 903120_904280
yes, this is from my very own home . 904280_908080
that's right .
it's a spatula .
spatula . 908080_909290
and it what when would I use particularly this spatula ? 909290_912190
cooking . 913240_914200
cooking . 914200_915150
hamburgers . 916110_917020
hamburgers, but where are you where are you usually make hamburgers ? 917020_919150
on the barbeque, so why would it have such a long handle ? 920030_923050
so you don't burn yourself . 923050_924030
don't I don't burn myself . 924030_927270
and it gives me more leverage too .
so let's let's think about all you have to do is look at this and decide where the three parts of the lever are . 927270_933110
you need to decide where the fulcrum is, where the load is where the effort is . 933110_937210
okay, well we know where the load is, right ? 937210_940020
the hamburger right here okay, so where would the effort be ?
effort on top . 940020_941990
you . 941990_942210
the effort would be me, and then where would be the part that moves the least amount ? 942210_946090
the bottom . 946090_947080
the bottom . 947080_952000
so this is the pivot point .
third . 952000_953250
I'm sorry, if the effort is in the middle it is a ? 953250_956190
third class lever, okay, so this is a third class lever . 956190_962270
ha, that would be cool . 965130_967290
with hamburgers .
thanks for laughing, spatula golf . 967290_973010
all right, lacrosse .
let's move on to this one . 973010_977000
these are skissor scissors .
skissors . 977000_978050
and they have the where is the pivot point of the scissors ? 978050_983150
middle . 983150_984050
the middle, right here, this little red dot . 984050_985010
so, we already answered our question . 986060_989040
the middle is the fulcrum, so what class lever is it ?
first class . 989040_990030
first class lever . 990030_993070
ow . 993070_995150
load, okay ?
it's painful .
did you cut yourself ? 995150_996140
no I didn't . 996140_997070
yeah, it's a nut cracker . 999140_1008130
and if I had a pistachio nut or something or my fingers in here ow, ow, ow where is the load ?
the load is where whatever your trying to hurt is and then the fulcrum would be this pivot point right here . 1009150_1016040
yeah . 1016040_1017020
and then the effort is here . 1017020_1018160
effort . 1018160_1021040
yeah most of the time, huh, in this case . 1021040_1022220
check this out, lester . 1022220_1023240
so if the load's in the middle, which class lever is it ? 1027210_1030100
second . 1030100_1031080
second class lever beautiful . 1031080_1037100
thank you .
all right, um, I just want to tell you a little story about something that happened to me in college okay ? 1037100_1044180
xxx picture . 1044180_1046090
you know I like to share things about myself with you and tell you boring stories so this is a boring story . 1050090_1057210
when I was in college I had an ra on the floor on my floor, my dorm floor that I lived . 1057210_1063270
what's an ra ? 1063270_1065050
a ra stands . 1065050_1076280
nobody knows, huh ?
resident assistant and that's a person who is in charge they get paid check this out .
they get paid a little extra money, and they are in charge of what goes on on the dorm floor . 1078250_1084170
talking to us if I uh something is wrong with our room like the carpet is torn up or something . 1094220_1099190
I would tell her and she would get somebody to fix it . 1099190_1107130
okay so I went to my ra because I was feeling really blue .
I was feeling really depressed . 1107130_1108100
oh, that's why it's blue . 1108100_1109180
you know kerry, you ought to you ought to take a trip somewhere, you ought to take a vacation . 1119160_1126030
just get away from it all .
so she said +"/.
+" you know, I have an rv and I can lend it to you . 1126030_1131220
so I went to my ra and she gave me her rv but she said what you have to do first is you have to go put some fuel in it . 1131220_1139090
oh, and then you went to la . 1139090_1140200
so then get you're getting ahead of me . 1140200_1143020
I got some fuel and then I went to l . 1146120_1148050
a .
then you went to vegas . 1148050_1149210
sin city . 1149210_1150230
then lost wages . 1150230_1152270
then I went to “lost wages” or Las_Vegas, and I drove all around Las_Vegas I went everywhere . 1152270_1158150
did you gamble ? 1158150_1159090
now, I'm not a big gambler but I do like to play the arcade games . 1159090_1162030
okay, arcade games are fun . 1163060_1164220
I like new york+new york a lot, but they're really expensive, so I usually end up at circus circus . 1164220_1170260
harrah's . 1172230_1173250
excalibur . 1175120_1176110
excalibur, that's it . 1176110_1178180
I said it first . 1178180_1179080
okay, okay yeah, you're right . 1179080_1182030
I'm sorry I didn't hear .
so so then I went from l . 1182030_1188280
a .
going all over the whole body of las vegas, but then I check this out . 1188280_1193170
I spent all my money on arcade games and video games and you know that dance ? 1195000_1199260
that dance thing . 1201120_1209170
and I came back feeling pretty bad . 1209170_1212130
a little bit better but uh because I'd gone away . 1213230_1216060
but I'd lost all my money so um I was feeling blue again, but it was a big learning for me . 1216060_1221240
it was really, really good .
is that a true story ? 1223020_1224030
all right . 1224030_1225000
that's the heart . 1225000_1226010
that's my story . 1226010_1227280
what does that have to do with anything ? 1228130_1230010
I don't know . 1230010_1231200
can somebody tell me about the story again . 1231200_1235040
where did I first go ?
to your ra . 1235040_1236140
I went to my ra, then where did I go ? 1236140_1238200
to your rv . 1238200_1240080
then I got the rv, but before I took on my trip I had to get ? 1240080_1242080
fuel . 1242080_1243160
fuel . 1243160_1244000
why did you go to l . 1244000_1245130
a .
though ?
okay, then after I got the fuel, where did I go ? 1245130_1249140
l . 1249140_1250080
a .
and then where did I go ? 1250080_1251160
las vegas . 1251160_1252180
las vegas . 1252180_1253020
why did you xxx ? 1253020_1254010
I don't know . 1256050_1257120
this is quite pointless . 1257120_1258080
cardiovascular . 1258080_1259200
genius class . 1259200_1261270
all right, all right .
yesterday we looked at uh we looked at bill nye, and bill nye mostly talked about what substance ? 1261270_1267100
the heart . 1267100_1268070
blood, we talked about blood . 1268070_1270100
yeah, 'cause it says on the top of the sheet . 1270100_1271120
lub dub, we talked about the heart we didn't finish, but we will . 1271120_1274250
no, but uh we talked about the heart . 1274250_1281230
let me ask you some questions .
how many liters of blood are in your body ?
five . 1281230_1282200
about five okay . 1282200_1287270
how many, how much, how many milliliters of white blood cells ?
three . 1287270_1288220
one+half . 1288220_1289110
half . 1289110_1290130
a half . 1290130_1291240
no no . 1291240_1293170
how many milliliters of white blood cells ?
five . 1293170_1294150
five, okay . 1294150_1300200
when you give blood when you donate blood about how much do you give ?
half a liter . 1300200_1301130
about half a liter exactly . 1301130_1302260
that's a lot of blood . 1302260_1303280
okay, about one of those water bottles full . 1303280_1306260
okay, great .
that's a group of five, and that's a group of four, that's a group of four, that's a group of four . 1312020_1315050
this is a group of three . 1315050_1324070
who is going to get out a piece of scrap paper . 1324070_1330030
piece of scrap paper .
please go ahead and get it out . 1331150_1345260
you have the longest hair . 1345260_1354160
you decide or you get it out .
get out just get out a piece of scrap paper, that's good .
okay, so, raise your hand if you have the scrap paper, raise your hand if you have the scrap paper . 1354160_1360140
where's your scrap paper ? 1360140_1366190
kathryn's going to get it out ?
okay you can put your hand down .
hey, are you on there ? 1367150_1371020
I don't think so .
ken do you have a scrap paper ? 1371020_1372190
no . 1372190_1373170
does anybody back there ? 1373170_1376200
you do, hannah ?
okay .
all right . 1376200_1383230
this is your mission for the next ninety eight .
six seconds .
the structure of loops . 1389170_1391200
looks . 1391200_1394220
that word says +"/.
+" looks .
the structure of what you think the structure of the heart is wait, wait, wait . 1394220_1399150
what you think, your group is a structure of the heart and you're going to jot that down . 1402050_1409020
shh, shh, shh and then the second thing is the function . 1409020_1416190
what it does like, what it has to do .
so structure and function, ninety eight . 1416190_1421250
six .
is that right ?
yeah . 1421250_1422020
yeah, ninety eight . 1422020_1429140
six seconds .
just jot down person with the scratch paper .
ready, go .
what ? 1429140_1430190
write it down . 1430190_1436160
miss dupont, these people weren't listening . 1436160_1443280
xxx I'm on a journey with myself .
shoot .
okay, so, what can you do to get them to tell you things ? 1443280_1447050
I can motivate them with my talking voice . 1447050_1449050
or ask them questions . 1451270_1458110
say, alicia, what do you think ?
alicia . 1458110_1460000
wait go ahead . 1463280_1465140
write that down .
xxx are actually orange . 1465140_1466060
good . 1466060_1469190
we've got we have some stuff written down .
hey, in the last class they said, they said they said um they said that the heart was about the size of a fist . 1469190_1477010
could that be something you could write down ? 1477010_1478160
yeah . 1478160_1479090
yeah . 1479090_1480040
yeah, and that's what I wrote . 1480040_1481010
well, isn't your heart actually orange ? 1481010_1488220
because I was watching like a they had like an open heart surgery that I saw on tlc, and it was orange .
yeah, it can be kind of that color . 1488220_1489280
that's because of the inside fluids . 1489280_1490220
but check hey, right here, karen's got some things she wants you to write down . 1490220_1495070
what do you got . 1508120_1511290
so far ?
it it has four chambers and pumps blood throughout your body . 1511290_1515150
it's about the size of your fist, and one side pumps blood to your lungs, and the other to the rest of your body . 1515150_1521180
miss dupont, what's that one word in the heart miss dupont . 1521180_1525120
it's like left to right . 1525120_1526200
it starts with an a .
artichoke . 1528260_1530000
ventricle and what . 1530000_1531270
do you know, xxx ? 1531270_1532270
huh, me ? 1532270_1533240
yeah . 1533240_1534220
I I'm afraid I don't . 1534220_1535280
steve might . 1535280_1541240
what's the a ?
in one of the chambers ?
you're going to find that out . 1541240_1543120
it's like xxx . 1543120_1545210
okay I'm looking around seeing you have some good stuff on your paper . 1545210_1552090
quit messing around . 1552090_1554180
good . 1554180_1562170
all right let me ask you a question . 1562170_1569050
why would I have you do an activity like this ?
why on earth would a teacher have you do something like this right now ? 1576250_1579210
because xxx . 1579210_1580280
why, why ? 1580280_1581270
so we can kind of like, gather the information that we already know . 1581270_1584050
shh . 1584050_1586090
kathryn's talking .
so we can learn more . 1586090_1587140
okay so, so in fact this is what education's is all about whether you have a teacher or not . 1587140_1591240
it's from going what you know from what you know already, to maybe what you don't know or knowing more . 1591240_1598000
okay . 1598000_1603130
and is it okay for you to write something on that paper and it be completely off base ?
yes . 1603130_1604080
because you're learning something . 1605000_1606010
is a guess, is a guess a form of questioning ? 1606010_1610040
yes . 1610040_1611030
and is it, remember all learning starts with a ? 1611030_1612250
question . 1612250_1613290
question . 1614240_1615010
hypothesis . 1615010_1616010
or a hypothesis or prediction . 1616010_1617080
we're learning about scientific method in social studies . 1617080_1618290
you are ? 1618290_1619270
we're like always xxx . 1619270_1620280
up top . 1620280_1622030
oh, don't give ken a high five . 1622030_1623040
blood vessels are red . 1624180_1625260
okay so let's look up here, let's up at the screen and were going to learn some stuff . 1625260_1630130
what did you say ? 1631190_1633100
ken has a song ?
yeah . 1633100_1634090
yeah . 1634090_1635210
okay . 1635210_1636010
oh they lub and dub and push out the blood . 1636010_1640200
do you get it ? 1640200_1645170
cause lub dub, and they push out the blood .
I like it a lot, I like it . 1645170_1653160
I like it a lot .
I think it's good, ken .
I always told you this is my genius class .
nine . 1653160_1654270
eight . 1654270_1656100
this is so pointless . 1657280_1658210
oh, he hates the counting . 1659210_1662080
but it's fun . 1662080_1663010
one, whoo ! 1663010_1665220
this is so exciting . 1666230_1668050
miss dupont, can I turn off the lights ? 1668050_1670130
hang on just a sec . 1670130_1671200
I asked first . 1671200_1672220
I got to focus . 1672220_1675090
it just takes moment .
can I turn off the lights miss dupont ? 1675090_1677070
hey lester . 1679290_1680270
yes . 1680270_1681280
I used the scientific background thing . 1681280_1683290
I found it when you told me that and I now I have all these really cool sounds and it's awesome . 1683290_1690030
thanks .
miss dupont, where did you get that ? 1690030_1692090
where did I get what ? 1692090_1693080
that scientific thingy . 1693080_1695200
I don't want to turn the lights out . 1695200_1696990
yeah you do . 1696990_1697260
close the blinds . 1698280_1700230
I will . 1700230_1703010
okay, it was on the computer already . 1703010_1706080
okay, this is called, Brain_Pop . 1706080_1712140
and it's got a whole bunch it has a whole bunch of um, different films on it .
play the movie . 1712140_1713160
so you just want to listen to this . 1717030_1718230
and see what you can come up with as far as confirming or correcting your information . 1718230_1728010
here we go . 1728010_1732230
oh yeah it's not on yet .
lub dub . 1732230_1734000
so you um, have a letter for me . 1734000_1736230
oh, a love letter . 1736230_1740240
and it's not even valentine's day .
of course it's a valentine, look at the envelope . 1740240_1746070
oh . 1746070_1751220
'dear tim and moby, sometimes when I'm playing hockey my heart beats so loud that I can hear it .
what's that all about ? 1751220_1754140
signed, lana .
all right, hearts, cause cause the letter was about the heart . 1754140_1757170
all right . 1757170_1762290
all right .
this is an important question, so I want to be sure we understand a few things about the heart .
the heart is a powerful muscle in your chest about the size of your fist . 1762290_1767020
the heart muscle is different from other muscles . 1767020_1769040
and so that cell waste products can be removed . 1774240_1777160
the heart is made up of two pumps, one on the left side and one on the right . 1777160_1781040
each of the pumps is made up of an atrium and a ventricle . 1781040_1784270
this right here, what is this called this is a ? 1790020_1792040
atrium . 1792040_1793070
and this is an atrium, and what are these ? 1793070_1795250
ventricles . 1795250_1796230
these are ventricles . 1796230_1802150
okay ?
now they're going to back up a little when I press this again .
the heart is made up of two pumps, one on the left side and one on the right . 1802150_1805160
each of the pumps is made up of an atrium and a ventricle . 1805160_1809090
the atria bring blood to the heart and passes it to the ventricles which pump the blood back out . 1809090_1814130
this pumping cycle produces your heart beat . 1814130_1816200
wait a minute, wait, wait I got to just uh+oh . 1817010_1819100
I didn't mean to go that far back . 1819100_1824240
the heart is a powerful muscle in your chest . 1824240_1829150
the heart is made up of two pumps one on the left side and one on the right .
sorry . 1829150_1830010
okay wait, wait . 1834240_1842200
this is where I want to stop .
why on earth is the right side here blue and that's red ?
oxygen . 1842200_1843280
what, what, what, what, what ? 1843280_1846120
nicola .
because it has oxygen xxx . 1846120_1847190
no . 1847190_1848160
this one has oxygen ? 1848160_1850050
what about this one ? 1850050_1852180
wait wait hang on . 1862080_1863240
settle down now . 1863240_1865110
deep breath . 1865110_1866190
quiet . 1866190_1868020
the red side looks like it has it has more oxygen . 1870290_1874040
no . 1874040_1875060
instead of the blue . 1875060_1876050
this side ? 1876050_1877030
yes . 1877030_1878010
this side has more oxygen it's red . 1878010_1879030
remember we talked about this yesterday . 1884220_1886140
and then what about this one ken ? 1886140_1887190
the the blood is blue before the oxygen gets to it . 1887190_1892050
bueno, okay . 1892050_1894070
it's without oxygen . 1894070_1895230
it's without oxygen . 1895230_1896260
oh no . 1898030_1899050
this pumping cycle increases your heart . 1899050_1902040
the heart is made up of two pumps .
one on the left side and one on the right . 1902040_1903210
each of the pumps is made up of an atrium and a ventricle . 1903210_1905260
sorry . 1905260_1907290
the atria bring blood to the heart and pass it to the ventricles which pump the blood back out . 1907290_1912260
this pumping cycle increases your heart beat . 1912260_1916050
here's how it works .
and needs to go to the lungs for more oxygen . 1920240_1923120
the left atrium fills with fresh blood from the lungs that is ready to got back through the body . 1923120_1927200
the atria squeeze blood into the ventricles below . 1927200_1930090
when all of the blood is in a ventricle, the valve between the ventricle and atrium closes and the ventricle pushes the blood out of the heart . 1930090_1937110
the right ventricle pumps used blood to the lungs . 1937110_1943170
the left ventricle pumps fresh blood into your body so it can circulate .
did you see how it does it simultaneously ? 1943170_1944280
that's so cool . 1944280_1946010
isn't it . 1946010_1947200
the right ventricle pumps used blood to the lungs . 1947200_1948200
sorry . 1948200_1950100
stop . 1950100_1951160
into your body so it can circulate . 1951160_1954040
it takes about one minute for blood to circulate through your entire body and back and to your heart to be pumped out again . 1954040_1958050
what's he doing ? 1958050_1959040
he's writing without any hands . 1959040_1961070
so now we know how your heart beats . 1961070_1962220
he's writing to the girl about what he's doing . 1962220_1963260
shh . 1963260_1965100
shh .
the process of pumping blood is one that your body does automatically over and over again no matter what you're doing . 1965100_1969210
listen, you guys . 1969210_1972070
shh .
right . 1972070_1978180
lana asked about feeling her heart beat during sports .
your heart rate increases when you run and play and even when you're nervous .
think about it . 1978180_1982160
when your bodies working hard, the muscles tire out quicker .
your heart needs to beat faster to get oxygen through your body so that you can keep going . 1982160_1986120
the faster and harder your heart is beating, the louder it sounds . 1986120_1994020
well I hope that answers your question lana .
another one . 1994020_1996080
dear tim . 1996080_2001210
you are nice and I like you .
ah . 2001210_2002110
that's the robot . 2002110_2004200
let's take the quiz . 2007030_2008220
we'll take it later . 2008220_2009260
no . 2009260_2010180
now .
no . 2010180_2012040
now . 2012040_2014030
settle down . 2014030_2015090
okay check this out . 2015090_2020230
this is blood pumping through your heart .
this is just a diagram of course .
okay, so you can see, you can see right here this is blood that's coming from the body . 2020230_2027060
this is called the inferior vena cava . 2027060_2029260
and this pumps blood from your body and it goes into your right atrium and then it goes down into the right ventricle, rv . 2037160_2050070
then it goes out the pulmonary artery to the lungs and gets fuel . 2050070_2062020
then it comes in the pulmonary vein to the la, left atrium . 2062020_2069240
oh . 2069240_2071280
that's why you did that .
then it goes to the left ventricle, then it goes out the aorta . 2071280_2076180
and that's why they were blue and red . 2080110_2081210
artery carries it down to the bottom all over the body . 2081210_2085020
they look like arms going like this . 2085020_2087180
that was your story . 2087180_2088140
miss dupont, you're really smart . 2088140_2090210
no you are . 2090210_2091000
and that's why it was red and blue . 2091000_2093130
okay this is blue because it doesn't have oxygen in it and this is red because it does . 2093130_2099100
now, vein is not up here, but what's the difference between an artery and a vein ? 2102290_2107010
it all has to do with coming and going to the heart . 2107010_2110150
lester .
I think an artery doesn't pump blood . 2110150_2113040
okay that is we're we're going in the right direction . 2113040_2117230
give me more pieces of the puzzle .
kathryn . 2117230_2118210
okay, I think the artery has blood that goes in to the heart, and then the veins are blood that comes out of the heart . 2118210_2125040
okay, we're getting closer and closer, you're exactly on the right track . 2125040_2129000
are our veins blue because they don't have oxygen in them yet ? 2129000_2131230
partly . 2131230_2135180
wait, wait, time out listen . 2136020_2138100
nicola, go ahead .
arteries take the blood xxx body, and the veins bring it back into your heart . 2138100_2142250
okay, so anytime blood is leaving, bye+bye, the heart it does it with an artery . 2142250_2150220
check this out and every time it goes into the heart we call it a vein . 2150220_2157160
oh . 2157160_2158150
wow . 2158150_2159010
so veins carry blood back to the heart and an artery takes it away bye+bye, okay question, comment ? 2159010_2167130
how is it when you cut yourself, but you don't like cut cut your like, vein or anything why is it how do you bleed ? 2167130_2175140
if your veins, if your veins like say you just like barely cut your hand like this ? 2175140_2182050
yeah . 2182050_2183050
why do you bleed ? 2183050_2184040
why do you bleed ? 2184040_2185120
because it but it's not touching your veins or arteries . 2185120_2188040
okay great question and this goes back to bill nye yesterday . 2188040_2191070
not only do we have arty artery and veins, but what's the bridge in between those two things ? 2191070_2195240
tissue . 2195240_2196230
muscles . 2196230_2197230
okay, tissue but something I'm thinking a very small little blood vessel ? 2197230_2199120
ligaments . 2199120_2202130
capillaries . 2202130_2203270
capillaries . 2203270_2207200
remember there's I think bill nye said this yesterday .
each cell is only about four cells away, three to four cells away from a capillary . 2207200_2213260
so that means that they're all really close to capillaries . 2213260_2216150
because if your body didn't have access to that blood, ken, what couldn't it get that it needs ? 2217090_2221220
oxygen . 2221220_2222210
oxygen that's right . 2222210_2225170
question ? 2225170_2226240
the blood in the heart to be pumped back out, is that the soft like xxx ? 2232040_2238030
it's the the valves . 2238030_2244090
the valves are opening and closing and that's what causes the lub dub .
lub dub . 2244090_2246160
hannah then jonas . 2246160_2248150
thank you . 2249100_2251050
when you get cut . 2251050_2252030
does the blood okay . 2252030_2259280
what happens when you what happens eventually when you bleed when you get a cut ?
what happens ?
it clots over and then it forms a scab . 2259280_2261260
what helps it to clot, steve ? 2261260_2263150
platelets . 2263150_2264050
the platelets, platelets help it to clot . 2264050_2266190
but if you have really thin that's why people that have really thin blood, if they get a little cut, they can bleed to death . 2267170_2273010
yeah like hemophiliacs, a lack of clotting factor, blood disorder . 2273010_2277220
jonas, you're next, go ahead . 2277220_2279040
please turn to page four ninety two while jonas is asking his question or making his comment . 2279040_2282260
xxx ? 2282260_2284140
is the xxx the lub is the biggest pump right ? 2284140_2286040
yes . 2286040_2291250
yes . 2291250_2292140
is that coming from the side of the heart without the oxygen or with the oxygen ? 2292140_2298190
it's the big push it is from the right atrium . 2298190_2307100
what's this ? 2307100_2308000
oh . 2309000_2311280
all right, this looks complicated and it's not . 2311280_2315290
this is really pretty simple but if you look at it first off, it kind of like, “whoa” it's a lot of stuff there . 2315290_2321240
what you'll need to do is you're going to follow the arrows . 2321240_2326090
everybody should have their own book, four ninety two . 2326090_2334000
everyone should have their own book, four ninety two .
all right, this is what you're going to do; we're going to trace the flow of blood . 2334000_2340200
we'll start with the ra up here, the right atrium .
so you're going to put your index finger on this right atrium, this white arrow . 2340200_2345280
please everybody do that now .
on the right atrium . 2345280_2348110
it's right here .
I know . 2348110_2349050
check with your table partner . 2349050_2350180
all right . 2350180_2351170
follow the white arrows down from the right atrium ra, to the rv, which is the right ventricle up and out of the heart . 2351170_2361210
remember anytime it's leaving, it's called an artery and since it's going to the lungs, we call it pulmonary . 2361210_2368090
the pulmonary artery is going to the lungs, it picks up fuel, swings back around, is carried back through the pulmonary vein . 2368090_2381270
wait wait wait wait what ? 2383150_2384180
isn't your heart right above your lungs though ? 2384180_2387070
um, actually it's right in between . 2387070_2389140
xxx going up ? 2389140_2390000
xxx a diagram . 2391000_2392010
oh oh um, yeah, I'm sorry, that's right . 2392010_2396190
this is a diagram and everything has been kind of pulled out .
I want you to see the flow and I want you to follow it . 2401040_2404050
trace it with your index finger . 2404050_2406160
we'll start over again . 2409040_2415090
hold up your index finger, bring it down on to the white arrow in the right atrium .
is that the blue ? 2415090_2416010
yes . 2416010_2417020
in the blue, yeah . 2417020_2418030
go to the just look, look up here . 2418030_2427210
left ventricle, l . 2427210_2438030
a .
, las vegas, up out of the aorta and then it goes through the whole systemic circulation .
and then it's used and then it travels back . 2438030_2448190
trace that path three times, ready go .
if you want to make race car sounds, you can . 2448190_2450210
you've got to be kidding . 2452240_2454100
okay great . 2458200_2460150
yes .
i'll bet if you asked someone that wasn't really smart to find the aorta xxx . 2460150_2465120
okay pit stop, pit stop pit stop, go . 2465120_2466190
everyone be quiet . 2466190_2469140
they'd probably keep on doing it over and over until they found it . 2475140_2478180
tricky . 2478180_2479200
I could find the end . 2479200_2481020
xxx I can't find my transparencies . 2481020_2489040
what did I do with them now ?
oh well .
oh yes, here they are . 2489040_2490120
okay hannah, this is what I want to show you . 2490120_2494050
it's backwards . 2497270_2498230
that's upside down . 2498230_2498270
okay, let's see how uh gifted you are now . 2498270_2507170
no, no that's a joke .
all right .
all right .
here we go .
oh no . 2508040_2509050
can I pick it up ? 2509050_2511000
yeah . 2511000_2512280
yeah .
just say, +"/.
+" dupont's classroom .
okay look up here . 2512280_2520010
check this out .
isn't that the left atrium . 2520010_2524120
you've been coached . 2524120_2526220
xxx to the office . 2526220_2532260
okay, no problem . 2532260_2535260
thank you .
okay, bye .
thank you . 2535260_2536250

okay . 2539230_2544290
okay check this out, check this out . 2544290_2551170
let's start with the right atrium like we do with ra .
watch, watch, watch . 2551170_2552070
yeah, sorry . 2554090_2555140
okay, it comes down here to the right ventricle, swings out now watch this hannah; check this out . 2557130_2562260
lungs . 2562260_2563220
lungs . 2563220_2564060
picks up oxygen in the capillary beds of the lungs, swings back down to the pulmonary vein, goes back to the where am i ? 2564060_2573190
oh, here is the left atrium, left ventricle, and then out here okay ? 2573190_2578010
capillary beds . 2578010_2580060
the four chambers of the heart in order and if you don't have a table partner please turn to, go ahead and turn to these two . 2585070_2594250
ben and lester, go through the four chambers . 2594250_2596170
what four chambers ? 2596170_2597200
