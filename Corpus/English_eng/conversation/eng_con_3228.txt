okay, it's another word beginning with those things . 0_2945
okay, so we have a conjecture, but we haven't really got the evidence yet . 2945_9353
so now we're going to have a look for some evidence . 9353_11861
okay . 11861_13711
oh, make sure your name is written on the page . 13711_15455
I see most people have already . 15455_16855
just in case it goes astray . 16855_19050
now you'll be working at the computers in groups of two or maybe three . 19050_22973
um, the computer that wasn't working yesterday has decided it's much happier about working today, so they all are working . 22973_30158
uh, so if you'd like to +... 30158_33405
do that . 33405_36831
xxx the chair xxx . 36831_74288
no . 74288_74655
give me the chair . 74655_76283
that's so unfair +... 76283_77673
give me the chair . 77673_79591
xxx . 79591_80605
notice I've fixed up +/. 80605_109586
yes . 109586_110618
thank you . 110618_111320
very well . 111320_115385
that's great . 115385_115911
well, there's a pentagon already . 115911_120415
how come xxx . 120415_126240
how come they do what ? 126240_128393
xxx . 128393_131643
oh . 131643_133166
yeah . 133166_135186
now be careful with what I was saying before . 135186_137716
rather than using that point, you need to use the one that's already on there . 137716_142051
so how do we get rid of that one ? 142051_143918
is there a way to undo that thing ? 143918_145630
yeah okay . 145630_148461
you can move +... 148461_149350
move that along a little bit and then go back to um +... 149350_155826
go back to that . 155826_157595
and then start from that one, when you do your next one . 157595_159945
yeah, that's good . 159945_163916
you can make it a bit bigger, but, uh, it should click on to that last . 163916_167945
oh, look at +... 167945_170388
just make sure just make sure they join . 170388_173781
get rid of that one . 173781_174378
xxx . 174378_176365
use the pointer tool, just to make sure that it's all joined together . 176365_181020
move them around a bit, and make sure they stay . 181020_183020
no that's not joined on . 183020_185430
okay, now xxx . 185430_190120
yep . 190120_204878
okay, if you go down to there . 204878_210945
just move the pointer down . 210945_212651
it should join up . 212651_213511
xxx . 213511_215043
oh, no, you don't want this to join up to that one yet, do you ? 215043_226993
no . 226993_227416
that's true . 227416_227926
you know what you're doing here . 227926_228711
I don't . 228711_229155
that's fine, actually . 229155_231421
see, what's happened here is you didn't +... 231421_241318
start the next one there, okay . 241318_254753
and then that that makes sure they're joined up, if you do that rather than having separate ones . 254753_258950
can I just test this one for you ? 258950_262356
oops . 262356_263213
let's make sure they're all joined on . 263213_269181
let's see, that's really not quite joined on . 269181_272886
you've got too many points there . 272886_274613
what you need to do with your with the second one is actually start with the point that's already on it . 274613_285751
okay, and then your your next one starts with the point that's already on it . 285751_292550
you can also move it around, so it looks a bit bigger, like so . 292550_299798
okay that's fixed that . 299798_302005
then start with that point . 302005_304398
then then they're all joined nicely . 304398_306830
xxx . 306830_318630
okay let's just check they're all nicely joined . 318630_321780
seems to be quite nicely joined . 321780_325408
okay, now, see what it says there +... 325408_334931
you've done that, you've done that . 334931_336046
on the rays outside of the pentagon construct points so we need to construct some points outside +... 336046_346318
we need those . 346318_348376
so we can talk about the angles . 348376_351080
all right now to measure the angles, you would go +... 351080_356796
that that that . 356796_362453
now that's one of the exterior angles, isn't it ? 362453_363646
so now we +... 363646_365593
can measure the angle . 365593_367998
okay . 367998_369118
okay, now do the same for that one . 369118_372486
measure the angles . 372486_373415
something tells me its going in the wrong direction . 373415_379686
see all these are going around that way . 379686_385563
and that one's going off in that direction . 385563_390221
can we just xxx suppose we draw it over +... 390221_399315
like so . 399315_403060
see how now they're all going around in the same direction . 403060_405285
like the diagram ? 405285_406341
that's a good one . 406341_416590
how are we going with ours ? 416590_434071
yeah that's looking +... 434071_436746
looking good so far . 436746_438250
hang on . 438250_447391
what are we doing here oh . 447391_450475
what you've got to do can I just use this cancel that . 450475_455111
you've actually got to select these things before you put them in the formula . 455111_458916
so you do that . 458916_460978
then you go calculate . 460978_462681
and then you can then you can have that angle plus that angle plus +... 462681_470155
oh +... 470155_470531
thank you . 470531_471020
no . 471020_481443
that's what it says in step three . 481443_483831
on the rays outside of the pentagon construct points . 483831_487291
so you've just got to select the point tool and click somewhere out there . 487291_491548
okay . 491548_496263
now we need to put xxx on this . 496263_498416
otherwise you can't you might need the point tool +... 498416_506256
that's good . 506256_516559
and then just make sure it joins up . 516559_518914
yes . 518914_519375
that's good . 519375_520216
that one ? 520216_521075
no, you did that one first . 521075_526280
it doesn't matter if they're not labeled really exactly the same way . 526280_541560
just as long as they've got labels . 541560_546431
okay . 546431_552916
I think you might need the select tool . 552916_554858
do you just measure the exterior or the inside ones as well ? 554858_565683
well, no, 'cause it's all about the exterior angles, isn't it ? 565683_568005
