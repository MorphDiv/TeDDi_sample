&-um I'm gonna go ahead and put the verb for the quiz on the board &=writing:board okay we're using do@s:fra dare@s:fra dedi@s:fra datus@s:fra today to give .
&=students_taking_quiz .
when you're finished with your vocab quiz would you turn to the required readings <and for your her quiz > required readings in lesson sixteen and take out any kernel and modifier charts you might have had for those from yesterday .
I wanna go through the forms (0.9) .
apparently that's an extra one +...
oh thanks Zack (0.21) .
isn't xxx (1.16) .
okay &-um +...
we're gonna go through these required readings and then we're gonna work on the narrative reading from lesson sixteen about the golden apple but the theme for the day is to think about first of all &=writing:board when do I &=writes:board see a dative ?
okay ?
and this is basically a morphological +...
consideration when do I see a dative form as I go from left to right ?
and &=coughs excuse_me at this point the next question is do I have enough information +...
to determine dative use ?
IE is it kernel versus nonkernel and then within those categories do I know where I am +..?
if the answer to this is no the next question is as I continue to read from left to right when do I have enough info ?
&=writing:board what we wanna do is develop a strategy for basically not panicking when we see a form like a dative particularly one such as cui@s:fra where there's a_lot &~l many levels of things you have to consider I've got a pronoun I've got a relative pronoun I'm in a dependent clause and it's in the dative case .
but we're just looking at things going left to right at what point do I know a certain amount +//.
do I have enough information to make a decision ?
so looking at the first one &-um Andy can you read that one aloud in Latin +..?
sixteen one .
mhm &{l=READING cui@s:fra fortuna@s:fra favit@s:fra multos@s:fra amicos@s:fra abit@s:fra .
&}l=READING .
mhm +...
how far into the sentence do you go before you see a dative word ?
first word .
okay <we met> cui@s:fra +...
what do you know at this point +..?
okay do you have enough information to determine which use you have ?
in other words to classify it as being either kernel or nonkernel just by looking at this dative word +...
John ?
⌈ would ⌉ .
⌊ &-uh ⌋ yeah .
how so ?
(be)cause it's &-uh relative pronoun's the first word in the sentence and when it's usually first word in the sentence then it's gonna function as the <comp relative to the> xxx .
oh okay yeah in in other words if we're at the level of clause &=writes:board for my relative clause do I have enough information to decide whether this is adjectival or noun ?
that is is it nonkernel in kind_of a different mode or kernel ?
sure absolutely you're in the world of a noun clause .
but as far as the dative use that is the particular &~dat I mean you're right it was just the we're addressing it from the angle of form of this .
do I know by looking at this word whether I have a a special intransitive kernel or a special linking kernel or something else something nonkernel ?
Andy ?
well have we only seen so far instances where cui@s:fra is used <as special> as special linking ?
because I can't think of any instances where cui@s:fra could be used as &~s special &~in +/.
⌈ I can't ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ I mean ⌋ special linking .
+, ⌈ special linking ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ if this is ⌋ special .
not without an antecedent .
okay .
in other words it would have to refer back to some word that fell into that category of abstract nouns of helping and hindering but <as a> <as a relative> as a relative pronoun introducing a noun clause this really can only refer to &=writes:board a person or a thing in the abstract +/.
mhm +/.
+, as it's defined by the relative clause so I I'd say no that you'd hafta rule out special linking .
I don't think you can really rule out anything else though you need more information .
&~d if you get a special intransitive verb then you know where you are .
if you get an accusative object for instance then you know you're in a nonkernel use .
so you +//.
this <you can> you can rule out special linking but we still have a wide +/.
+, mhm +/.
+, open field at this point but that's &~some I mean it's good to know that &~y I shouldn't have to worry about this .
does everybody understand why you can rule out special linking at this &~p ?
no .
okay what's the criteria Kurt as far as you understand it for datives which occur in special linking kernels ?
there hasta be +//.
the dative <is the> is the dative object so there hasta be another word a &~n noun in the nominative to &~s serve as the subject of the sentence .
right but there's an additional restriction and that is if you look on page one sixty five (0.5) in the middle of that page the &~s &~s &~s &~s &~se the section entitled the special linking kernel okay I've got nouns such as auxilio@s:fra ponori@s:fra impedimento@s:fra saluti@s:fra and usui@s:fra and these nouns are all generally nouns of either helping or hindering or advantage or disadvantage so that's a restriction on the meaning of the noun .
and unless this pronoun refers to such an idea such a noun &~s elsewhere it's not going to stand for it .
in other words it won't represent that idea and so on the basis of the meaning or &~th in this case the nonmeaning of the relative you can eliminate that possibility .
so special linking involves nouns of very particular meanings in the dative case +...
okay keep going &=writes:board when do I have enough information Andy to decide what use of the dative I've got does fortuna@s:fra help you out ?
no .
no okay ?
I just know I have my subject .
how about favit@s:fra ?
yes .
how does it help you out ?
because it's a verb on that list .
mhm what list ?
the list of verbs that take &-um dative case .
mhm dative objects it's on the special intransitive list so if I recognize favit@s:fra as being on that list I can then I know where I am with cui@s:fra <and I> and I know &=writes:board then I've got my environment for the dative case and then I should know how to translate the sentence .
so Andy how did you translate this thing ?
&-um whom fortune favors has many &~f he whom &~f fortune favors has many friends .
mhm +...
okay .
&=writing:board questions on that anybody translate it differently +..?
anybody not see why that's a correct answer it isn't the only correct answer but it's certainly one correct answer +...
okay good .
sixteen two +...
Mary can you read that one aloud ?
&{l=READING inopiae@s:fra desunt@s:fra multa@s:fra avaritiae@s:fra omnia@s:fra &}l=READING .
mhm okay and where do you run into the dative noun ?
inopiae@s:fra .
okay is that enough in and of itself to tell you anything ?
no .
so I keep reading .
&=writing:board this is a word which even could be a notion of helping or hindering I mean this idea of &-um poverty or neediness it's hard to rule that out so I would even keep the special linkings open .
just just because it's not clearly an animate noun or clearly a concrete noun .
how about multa@s:fra ?
is that +//.
do you know where you are at that point does it help you any in any way +..?
how about desunt@s:fra ?
(0.8) is it a special intransitive verb ?
(0.4) Jim is it on that list of special intransitives ?
(0.7) .
&-um no ?
no so so even if I can't absolutely pin it down at this point this isn't a linking verb so I'm not in special linking .
it isn't on my special intransitive list so I'm not in special intransitive so I can then say even if I can't at this moment pin down the direct use of this I know that I have a nonkernel dative because it doesn't fulfill the criteria for either special intransitive or special linking .
so then we move into the &~w the four possibilities for the environment of the dative when it is not kernel on +//.
starting on page one sixty seven .
(0.5) dative with est@s:fra and its compounds .
okay does that help me +..?
yeah sure it says all compounds of the verb sum@s:fra esse@s:fra except absum@s:fra set up the expectation of a dative hence adsum@s:fra desum@s:fra well desum@s:fra that's what I've got that something is lacking to something or something fails something so once I find this as part of the correct environment then I know where I am +...
&=writes:board Mary as you continue to read that you see comma and then you see avaritiae@s:fra +...
what does that signal for you as you read ?
a new clause .
mhm okay and what about avaritiae@s:fra ?
well it's dative again but we don't know what it is yet ?
okay let's think about what we've experienced and what would be probable in such a circumstance .
I have an abstract singular dative okay I've got a nominative plural noun and I have a form of the verb desum@s:fra which is intransitive .
then I get a comma then I get another singular dative of an abstract noun .
what am I likely to have based on what the kinds of pattern +//.
word order patterning that is seen in Latin ?
gapping .
yeah .
I probably have a parallel structure which involves gapping so avaritiae@s:fra is parallel to inopiae@s:fra .
so I can expect one or more of &=writes:board these things to be gapped missing on that side .
okay so with that in mind what's the next word after avaritiae@s:fra ?
omnia@s:fra .
omnia@s:fra okay and omnia@s:fra is parallel to ?
multa@s:fra .
multa@s:fra and I'm at the end of my sentence so my gap is clearly the verb so inopiae@s:fra and avaritiae@s:fra have the same function .
yep .
where does the ending for inopiae@s:fra come from ?
&~i does it pattern with tacens@s:fra like tacens@s:fra ?
no it's first declension .
look at the top of page one sixty four .
oh I know what you're thinking (be)cause you're thinking of inops@s:fra ?
yeah .
yeah .
this is an example &=writes:board of +//.
this is the adjective meaning needy or poor and it's a one ending adjective and follows tacens@s:fra .
what you have in inopiae@s:fra is a derived noun from that adjective that follows the first ⌈ declension ⌉ +/.
⌊ oh okay ⌋ .
+, inopiae@s:fra inopiae@s:fra feminine meaning neediness or poverty .
you see that same pattern +//.
we had the adjective sapiens@s:fra sapientis@s:fra which meant which means wise but what's the word +//.
anybody remember the word for wisdom ?
sapientia@s:fra .
sapientia@s:fra and you &~i that's a regular formation pattern &-um from third declension adjectives with a &-um a derived abstract noun in first declension where you get this T I A ending so that's what you have in inopia@s:fra .
and you have it in avaritiae@s:fra too .
same thing .
so this is just a first declension noun .
anybody have questions on these two ?
Mary how would you translate this into English ?
well I handed in my translation already so trying to remember the many &-um are lacking for neediness .
mhm +/.
+, and &-um &~e everyone is lacking for greed .
okay we're almost there .
she said the many are lacking for neediness every one is lacking for greed .
there's something slightly off about that which is why it sounds a little funny .
if you say the many and everyone are you reading those +/.
+, are you treating those substantives as +/.
+, animate +/.
+, animate or nonanimate ?
animate .
as animate sure +/.
⌈ <so the neuter endings> ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ but the neuter endings ⌋ tell you that they must be nonanimate so try it again with the neuter .
the many things +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ are lacking ⌋ for &-um neediness <and then> and then now is it animate with omnia@s:fra or the .
we could say instead of everyone you just ⌈ have ⌉ +/.
⌊ say ⌋ everything ?
+, everything .
everything is lacking for greed ?
⌈ <I guess> ⌉ .
⌊ mhm ⌋ yeah good .
questions ?
okay next one sixteen three .
this isn't that awful <omnus@s:fra virum@s:fra is it> ?
no not yet okay good .
Tanya .
sixteen three deus@s:fra +//.
read the whole thing aloud in Latin .
(0.7) .
&{l=READING deus@s:fra superbis@s:fra resistet@s:fra humilibus@s:fra autem@s:fra dat@s:fra gratiem@s:fra .
&}l=READING .
mhm I'm reading along right ?
right to left I see deus@s:fra what do I know so far ?
subject .
subject .
subject .
okay so God or a god is &=writes:board doing something and then I see superbis@s:fra do I have a dative there ?
yeah .
yeah do I know at this moment +//.
can I make a decision about what use of the dative case I have ?
unhunh .
no I don't .
I don't know enough except again I can probably rule out special linking because the dative is not one of those auxilio@s:fra impedimento@s:fra <auricula@s:fra words> .
but I still need to know &=writng_on_board some more information particularly with reference to the verb and I see resistet@s:fra .
do I know where I am ?
(0.5) Paul do I know where I am ?
yeah .
how do I know ?
resistet@s:fra 's@s:fra on that special intransitive list .
yeah .
&=writes:board so as soon as I recognize that as being on the list I know I have dative object here .
hm ?
so Tanya how would you translate just this much of the sentence ?
&-um gods resist +//.
I'm not sure what that word means .
superbus@s:fra ?
it means proud or arrogant .
so the gods resist the arrogant ?
mhm +/.
mkay +/.
+, or &~go the +//.
in this case one god ⌈ resists ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ oh okay ⌋ +/.
+, the arrogant .
as I keep reading humilibus@s:fra .
&=writing:board what have I got here ?
a dative .
a dative okay ?
I don't have enough information yet to do anything right ?
I need more .
right .
+, and the next word I see is autem@s:fra we'll pass over that that's not +//.
just means that my &~i my clauses are going to be contrastive in meaning but what's the next word I see or you see ?
dat@s:fra .
dat@s:fra okay .
does this give me any information or does it help me rule out anything ?
well it is is it a special intransitive verb ?
<no I guess not> +...
no it's not .
nope so whatever I've got going on here I don't have a special intransitive kernel .
is it linking ?
no .
no I don't have special linking besides the semantics of this again <and I'm not gonna> rule it out .
so I'm in the world of nonkernel datives .
at this point can I rule out dative with est@s:fra ?
yes .
yes xxx mkay so it's something else going on what's my next category Tanya ?
on page .
dative with verbs meaning give tell show offer ?
okay is this a verb meaning give tell show offer ?
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ yes ⌋ so now I know where I am and my expectation at this point +//.
what what further structure part of speech part of the sentence do I expect Jim ?
the accusative .
mhm because these are +//.
you give +//.
&=writes:board you have some subject giving gives direct object to a beneficiary in the dative well I've already got the beneficiary and I have the giving expression &-um I expect then to find out what is being given .
and where &~d do I get that in what word Tanya ?
gratiem@s:fra .
gratiem@s:fra so how would you translate the second half of the sentence ?
but the gods give the god gives &-um favor to the humble .
mhm good .
John .
what's autem@s:fra <doing in this sense> ?
it's a a clause connector that conjoins &-um it +//.
&=writes:board here it is semantically and functionally equivalent to sed@s:fra .
it means but .
the the thing about autem@s:fra and a few other words in Latin is that we would expect sed@s:fra as English but to come at the very beginning of the second clause .
there's a couple words in Latin that are called postpositives which means they always trail into second position they don't like to be right in the first place but in translating we have to translate it first .
I guess you could do it in English by saying +...
God resists the arrogant .
to the humble however he gives favor and that would +//.
I +//.
you can do it with however in English .
you can't do it with but which hasta be right there in the beginning .
anybody have a question yeah Andy ?
no I have a question on on number two .
mhm .
if you translate that as the the many are lacking +//.
how did we translate it before ?
well Mary started out by saying the many are lacking .
the problem with that is that the many in English I think implies animacy .
oh the many &~th if +/.
⌈ right ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ you ⌋ translate it as the many things are lacking for the poor +/.
+, ⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ then ⌋ you would &~trans then you would consider &~in@s:fra inopiae@s:fra as a dative right ?
mhm it is a dative .
it is a dative .
it is a dative but .
could you translate that as the poor are lacking many things ?
&-um .
and &~trans and ⌈ consider ⌉ .
⌊ we got a couple ⌋ yeah we got a couple layers of things going on there &-um the first thing is &=writes:board something that no one brought up and that is whether or not +//.
how you resolve <&~th &~th> the formal ambiguity of inopiae@s:fra because with the forms that you now know of first declension what are the possibilities for this ?
could be ⌈ ablative ⌉ .
⌊ genitive ⌋ .
nope that would be +/.
genitive +/.
+, with an A .
could be ⌈ genitive ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ nominative plural ⌋ +/.
could be nominative plural .
&=writes:board could be genitive singular could be +//.
well that +//.
we know it's not that (be)cause we don't know how to use it okay .
could be nominative plural or it could be dative singular .
so the real first question you hafta answer here is how do I decide when do I know for instance that this form represents a dative singular rather than a nominative plural ?
and this is a problem that you can solve +//.
we had that &=writes:board that possible probable necessary set of steps and you can solve this on the basis of semantics because inopiae@s:fra is an abstract noun and it means poverty or neediness .
it and it does not in and of itself refer to any people .
okay it's just the abstract notion .
in Latin as in English you don't often find abstract nouns in the plural .
mkay I mean that the notion of poverties doesn't it doesn't really make much sense and it didn't make sense to the Romans either .
so if you have an abstract noun such as inopiae@s:fra or sapientiae@s:fra or avaritiae@s:fra or amicitiae@s:fra meaning poverty or wisdom friendship greed .
these things are more likely on the basis of their meaning to be singular than plural .
it's not theoretically impossible but it's really unlikely .
so these possibilities move to a probability of dative singular just because of it's an abstract noun .
so then I I for all intents and purposes I know I have an +//.
a dative &~t to go on with so then I have this notion of &=writng_on_board to or for neediness or poverty with respect to this abstract notion multa@s:fra desunt@s:fra many things are lacking and with respect to greed everything is lacking .
but it's really hard in English because lack is something that we interpret just the other way around .
that &~th I lack height okay whereas the Latin would say tallness or height is lacking with respect to me so desunt@s:fra works just the other way around in English .
any other questions ?
Mary .
I still don't understand like exactly what that translation would even mean like is that the sense &~o of for is that because of like many things are lacking because of me that it ⌈ is ⌉ ?
⌊ no ⌋ +/.
+, I still don't understand .
yeah ⌈ it's a hard &~i &~i and ⌉ +/.
⌊ just like what's the xxx ⌋ +/.
+, this is true of all datives .
you have this general +...
&-uh it's almost as if you're putting a limit on the truth value of a statement .
so if I have the statement &=writes:board many things are lacking okay or many things are missing or lacking .
and let's pick one slightly more concrete and easier from basic sentence sixteen one the city is unfriendly .
okay now these are statements of fact .
what the dative does is put a kind of reference or specification for these or limits their truth value .
so it may not be true that the city is unfriendly in all circumstances to all things and to all people but I know &=writes:board poetis@s:fra with respect to poets as far as poets are concerned the city is unfriendly .
&~an and that's really what datives do they they kind of limit the range of meaningfulness or validity of a certain statement .
so with &~i in this one many things are missing &=writes:board inopiae@s:fra if you're talking about poverty .
with respect to poverty .
as far as poverty's concerned many things are missing .
okay ?
now if you're talking greed avaritiae@s:fra everything is lacking .
so it's a way of providing perspective .
when you get into reading narratives what what I often find the dative does if you're doing a a narrative is that it's it's almost like you're directing a film and at a certain point the camera shifts to look at a situation from a certain character's viewpoint and the dative can represent that kind of viewpoint .
&-um that perspective from which things are seen .
it's a fuzzy area and that's one reason why the dative (i)s so hard because it isn't one of those clean adverbial categories .
other questions .
okay let's &-um &=unspecified_filled_pause let's skip sixteen four for the moment there are just too many places too many things about this that could interfere with &~j getting a handle on the dative .
but look at sixteen five going through this same thing Jim how would you +//.
could you read that one aloud ?
&{l=READING sol@s:fra omnibus@s:fra lucet@s:fra &}l=READING or lucet@s:fra .
mhm okay <where do you hit> where do you hit the dative word ?
omnibus@s:fra .
yeah .
&=writing:board where are you at that point ?
or where might you be or where do you definitely know you're not ?
which use of the dative can you rule out ?
&-um the intransitive special intransitive ?
⌈ or <all I have> ⌉ .
⌊ well it's hard to rule out ⌋ special intransitive until you ⌈ actually have the verb ⌉ .
⌊ xxx the verb ⌋ .
alright &-um +...
linking ?
special linking yeah okay .
now when you get the verb lucet@s:fra where are you now ?
then you know it's not the special intransitive .
yeah this verb is not one of those so then now we're going through again our list on page one sixty seven I don't have dative with est@s:fra &-um is this a verb of giving showing telling or offering ?
no .
no okay .
&-uh third possible specific category is it a compound verb ?
no .
and on top of page one sixty eight there are certain +//.
there are datives that pattern with a certain set of adjectives but I don't have any adjectives in this sentence so it's not that .
so then I'm in the default mode +...
which is on the top of page &-um actually the bottom of page one sixty six .
second paragraph under nonkernel occurrences .
&{l=READING a dative that occurs without any special signal in the environment generally designates the person less often the thing to whom the sentence refers or is of interest .
the name commonly used to describe it is dative of reference .
&}l=READING so if I add omnibus@s:fra to the sentence fugit@s:fra hora@s:fra and get omnibus@s:fra hora@s:fra fugit@s:fra time flies for everyone okay .
&-um that seems to be where I am here this is just a general dative of reference and so the sun shines ⌈ for everybody ⌉ +/.
⌊ for every ⌋ +/.
+, with respect to everybody +...
okay .
questions anything that came up in the dative lesson that you still are fuzzy about ?
(0.5) okay let's look at Hercules and the golden apples for just a second .
I wasn't sure how many of you had brought your course packs with so this is the copy of what you hadta read .
(0.7) xxx looking at the Latin going from left to right and seeing how much you know at what point .
consider the first five words in the first sentence &{l=READING decimo@s:fra labora@s:fra confecto@s:fra Uristheus@s:fra Herculi@s:fra .
&}l=READING so if I'm just describing what I see there okay in decimo@s:fra laboro@s:fra confecto@s:fra I see an ablative noun phrase decimo@s:fra labora@s:fra with an ablative participle confecto@s:fra and a comma so I draw on all of my stored knowledge and realize I have an ablative absolute .
then I see a nominative noun Uristheus@s:fra which is undoubtedly my subject and I see a dative noun Herculi@s:fra .
which is the name of Hercules so I know at this moment that I can automatically rule out special linking .
because he doesn't fit the criteria .
I can also probably rule out dative with est@s:fra as showing possession because it's unlikely that this sentence means Uristheus belongs to Hercules or Hercules has Uristheus which is +//.
semantically it seems improbable .
so I really need some more information before I can decide whether I have special intransitive &-um or some other use of the dative case .
as I continue to read to the right as soon as I see undecimum@s:fra laborem@s:fra and I have an accusative I know that I don't have a special intransitive kernel .
I'm in some use of the dative which involves the transitive active kernel and that can be +//.
the two most likely possibilities are gonna be ones where the verb is of giving something to someone or of a compound which takes an accusative object plus the dative .
John ?
are you saying those are the two most common always ?
⌈ <the two xxx> ⌉ .
⌊ no the two ⌋ most common as soon as you know there's +/.
⌈ alright ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ an ⌋ accusative direct object involved .
then when I see imposuit@s:fra okay that just allows me to to link it and say oh this is one of those compound verbs .
Uristheus imposed the eleventh labor on Hercules .
(0.7) okay now looking at the next sentence .
&{l=READING Hercules@s:fra aurea@s:fra poma@s:fra .
&}l=READING if we assume that we know &=writes:board poma@s:fra comes from pomum@s:fra and is neuter (0.5) what do I know at this point ?
what kind_of a metaphrase would I give ?
what are my expectations after these three words ?
Jim ?
Hercules@s:fra is the subject and that aurea@s:fra poma@s:fra is his direct object .
mhm so what do I expect ?
&-um transitive active kernel I guess .
good okay and how far do I read before I see that transitive active verb ?
to the end .
not quite all the way to the end .
the infinitive .
yeah okay (be)cause it's the infinitive that's gonna govern kernel type .
so I now know Hercules +...
was able to bring back ought to bring back &-um didn't want to bring back I need some sort of verb to govern the infinitive but I know what the syntactic and semantic relationship is between Hercules and these golden apples .
and then when I get debuit@s:fra I I just fill it into that slot .
okay he was supposed to bring back he ought to bring back the golden apples from the garden of the Hysperides .
after the first three words in the next sentence &{l=READING Hysperides@s:fra erant@s:fra nymphae@s:fra &}l=READING okay Nicole can you just describe what you &~w what you have in those three words .
&-um (0.10) the Hysperides@s:fra is the subject .
mhm +/.
+, and we have the verb and &-um +...
it's indicative (0.13) .
well let's back it up once if I see Hysperides@s:fra erant@s:fra I know I've got my subject and my verb right ?
mhm +/.
+, okay &=writing:board now what are the two possibilities actually now there's three possibilities that I can have after erant@s:fra which by the way is a form of the verb to be .
you can have a direct object a ⌈ subject complement ⌉ .
⌊ ah that's the ⌋ one thing I can't have .
oh +/.
+, because the the verb sum@s:fra +//.
forms of sum@s:fra esse@s:fra can't have +//.
they are never show up in transitive active kernels .
so +/.
+, okay +/.
+, what are my three possible kernel types that I can have with est@s:fra or sunt@s:fra or some form of the verb to be ?
⌈ linking ⌉ .
⌊ linking ⌋ .
⌈ linking ⌉ &=writes:board and .
special ⌊ linking ⌋ .
⌈ special ⌉ linking .
special linking and .
intransitive .
intransitive active right where you're just talking about existence .
so I +//.
at this point if I have intransitive active I'd expect no other parts .
okay nothing else .
if I have linking what do I &~ex what is my expectation ?
subject ⌊ complement ⌋ .
⌈ subject ⌉ complement .
yeah which is going +//.
what's that gonna look like ?
noun ⌊ in the nominative ⌋ .
⌈ it's gonna be <the subject> ⌉ .
noun in the nominative or possibly what other part of speech can I have ?
adjective .
⌊ an adjective ⌋ .
⌈ an adjective ⌉ so &=writes:board a noun or adjective in the nominative okay .
<what if> what if I have special linking ?
what is my expectation ?
dative .
dative .
dative .
a dative what ?
dative +/.
⌊ comp ⌋ +/.
+, ⌈ part &~o ⌉ what part of speech ?
comp .
object .
a dative noun +...
but it's not any dative noun right ?
what &~i what is .
inanimate dative ⌊ noun ⌋ +/.
⌈ animate ⌉ +/.
pardon ?
inanimate +/.
animate +/.
+, &~dat dative noun .
inanimate nonanimate dative noun .
abstract .
abstract what kind of range of meaning do these things have ?
they're very restrictive .
<help or hindrance> .
helping or hindering right these are the the the danger the aid the impediment the safety that kind of thing so it's an &=writes:board abstract dative noun plus minus advantage shall we say .
okay so those are my three expectations John ?
in this sentence &-um couldn't it be like technically the other way around where like the nymphae@s:fra xxx <created were> your subjects and the the Hysperides@s:fra were .
it could be but usually what you've got at the beginning of a sentence &=writes:board is what we call old or given information that is especially in narrative stuff that's already been mentioned or that the writer assumes is in the consciousness of or awareness of the reader .
and that comes first in the sentence it's only later on in the sentence that you get the new info .
okay +/.
+, and the Hysperides were just mentioned in the sentence above so they're the link they're the discourse link okay .
he's supposed to get these things from the garden of the Hysperides so you're thinking oh who are the Hysperides and now we're gonna tell you .
the Hysperides were okay .
so now Nicole going back to the issue of nymphae@s:fra when you see nymphae@s:fra which one of these three intransitive active linking or special linking do you automatically rule out ?
intransitive .
yeah because I have another item here okay .
now this could that could be a nominative plural noun but it could also be a dative so then I wanna check the meaning to see whether it fulfills this meaning criteria .
does it ?
no .
⌊ no ⌋ +/.
⌈ (be)cause ⌉ Nymphs are +/.
+, yeah Nymphs are people .
okay <they're way> they're way +//.
they may be of an advantage or pleasure to somebody &-um but they they're not going to +//.
they're not abstract .
so I remove this and I remove this so now what have I got ?
&-um you've got a linking kernel with nymphae@s:fra as the subject complement .
mhm so what does it mean just that much of it ?
&-um the &~Hysper Hysperides +/.
mhm +/.
+, are nymphs .
yeah were nymphs +/.
were nymphs +/.
+, yeah just kind_of a narrative voice .
John ?
what if it was a helping verb of like advantage or disadvantage ?
how do you determine between then whether it's linking or special intransitive ?
ah because you already know that this is not a special intransitive ⌊ verb ⌋ .
⌈ well alright ⌉ well linking or the one we just crossed off .
intransitive active ?
⌊ if you ⌋ .
⌈ not ⌉ <&~int active> but the special one that ⌊ we just did ⌋ .
⌈ right ⌉ okay &=writes:board between this and this ?
say it was +//.
met the criteria for special linking +/.
right +/.
+, how do you determine whether it would be special linking or just normal linking ?
ah it's gonna be special linking .
that'll take a verb ?
yeah yeah that'll regularly &-um pattern like that .
it's only going to be a problem really if you're dealing with first &-um declension nouns because that's the only declension where the dative and the nominative are ambiguous .
in every other instance you're not gonna have <a the> problem .
but yeah no I would make &~spec <if it> if it fills that criterion if it's abstract it's not likely to be plural so okay good .
&-um well thank you very much .
I think we're done and thanks for allowing this to be videotaped this project thanks you .
&-um assignment for Monday we're moving on to lesson seventeen which is the genitive case it's pretty easy &-um it resembles structure in English almost exactly and we have no quiz on Monday so have a nice weekend a good holiday .
before you guys take off I need to just +//.
it takes about twenty seconds to fill this thing out .
<you can have> a bunch of old ones .
can +//.
like this is the homework ⌊ I brought ⌋ +/.
⌈ mhm ⌉ +/.
+, can you correct that ?
you ⌊ bet ⌋ .
⌈ or ⌉ I have the translations on back so .
okay yeah if anybody wants me to look at +//.
if you wrote out your stuff on the &-uh golden apples thing and you &~wa you'd like me to take a look at it just hand it in .
is there anybody who hasn't given me a consent form back ?
okay
