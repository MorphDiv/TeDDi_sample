I just want you to put your assignment in your folder and put your folder away . 151925_154900
I will give you a sheet that we're gonna work on today that you can take notes on . 154900_158140
okay . 158140_158618
okay . 158618_159028
the only thing you need on your desk is this piece of paper I'm gonna give you and a pencil . 159028_162970
do we need a calculator ? 162970_165748
you don't need your calculator right now . 165748_166745
no . 166745_167188
want our book ? 167188_169306
you don't need your book right now either . 169306_172171
send that five to that other group back there . 172171_174761
I forgot my book at home . 174761_175395
I'm a bad girl . 175395_177545
yes, Tim ? 177545_179468
please excuse, tardy . 179468_182153
okay . 182153_182705
where do I sit ? 182705_189121
right there . 189121_190546
right there . 190546_192115
okay . 192115_207780
I have you broken into groups today because I want you working +... 207780_211801
we're gonna work on this individually and we're gonna work on this as a group . 211801_215625
I do not want you to begin anything on the assignment, so turn the paper over please . 215625_219761
you didn't get one ? 219761_222400
yeah . 222400_223880
he has one . 223880_228015
he has one ? 228015_228406
yeah . 228406_228991
okay . 228991_229631
so turn it over, and most of chapter eight that we're gonna deal with, is dealing with exponents . 229631_236126
and for exponents we have to remember back from what I first introduced to you in fifth grade . 236126_242510
you learned about two squared and two cubed . 242510_245110
okay . 245110_245933
remember on the the the composition of your exponent it always has a base number . 245933_250806
and then the power or the exponent is the number that it is risen to . 250806_255143
okay . 255143_255606
the exponent stands for the number of times that the base is going to be multiplied . 255606_262471
so if we have two cubed, this tells me that the base is gonna be multiplied three times . 262471_267803
two, times two, times two . 267803_269765
and the thing we're gonna learn about in this unit is exponential growth . 269765_274006
if we look over here, we have two cubes . 274006_277548
this would be like two to the first power . 277548_279611
so if we made it two squared, which would be two times two, we would see that it grows to two squared . 279611_287401
that's two times two, right ? 287401_289451
two cubed is two, times two, times two . 289451_293116
two to the third power . 293116_295915
you see it's starting to double in size . 295915_298163
then if we go two to the fourth, you're looking at +... 298163_302675
and you see how quickly it starts to grow . 302675_307506
okay . 307506_308636
now two to the fourth is how much ? 308636_312281
sixteen . 312281_314456
sixteen . 314456_315370
yeah . 315370_315993
that's xxx . 315993_316778
see if I can get this to stand here . 316778_318178
I don't know if I will . 318178_319003
okay . 319003_319635
so two to the fifth would be how much ? 319635_321281
twenty five . 321281_322906
twenty five ? 322906_323401
no . 323401_324931
twenty . 324931_325410
thirty two . 325410_325921
well, we know that +... 325921_326913
thirty two . 326913_328163
two to the fourth is sixteen . 328163_330585
thirty two . 330585_331416
and we take that and multiply it by two and we get ? 331416_333511
thirty two . 333511_334160
thirty two . 334160_334513
okay . 334513_335848
so you see it is continually doubling . 335848_339488
look at the growth . 339488_342105
it's very big . 342105_342800
it's very, very big . 342800_344518
okay . 344518_345215
so whenever we're dealing with powers +... 345215_347086
xxx . 347086_350023
Kamikaze . 350023_350526
Oops, all the cubes fell over !
whenever we're dealing with powers, we're gonna see that the growth goes quickly . 350526_355618
okay . 355618_356678
so think about that in terms of a graph . 356678_358791
we've looked at slope . 358791_359753
right ? 359753_360825
and we've always had a constant slope . 360825_363463
what do you think if we were gonna graph two to the x@l power ? 363463_367535
think about that in turns . 367535_370248
we found that two to the one was two . 370248_372855
two . 372855_373415
two to the two was four . 373415_375113
four . 375113_375530
two to the three was ? 375530_376893
eight . 376893_378193
and two to the fourth was ? 378193_379745
sixteen . 379745_380455
what do you think that graph's gonna look like ? 380455_383410
it a curve . 383410_385280
yeah . 385280_386473
it's gonna be a curve . 386473_387745
think about that . 387745_389560
two to the first power, we get just two . 389560_394343
right ? 394343_394791
then we go up to four . 394791_396550
we go up to eight . 396550_399398
we go up to sixteen . 399398_400775
we get some significant growth . 400775_403690
okay . 403690_404785
yes ? 404785_405298
become a parabola if you go to the negative side . 405298_408841
that's a good question . 408841_409995
we're gonna explore that in this unit . 409995_411633
okay . 411633_412083
we're gonna start dealing with the negative exponents . 412083_415080
but first we're just gonna play around and there's certain rules that you have to learn when you deal with exponents . 415080_420330
okay . 420330_420655
and that's what you're gonna work on as a group and individually . 420655_424401
first of all, there's gonna be three different rules that we're gonna find out about when we multiply exponents . 424401_430153
and what I want you to do on your worksheet in front of you, we're gonna work on just section one right now . 430153_435681
but before we get there, I'm gonna go through the three different rules of multiplying exponents . 435681_440695
okay . 440695_441801
if we think about this, what does two squared mean ? 441801_444720
two times two . 444720_446735
that's two times two . 446735_447711
right ? 447711_448143
and what does two cubed mean ? 448143_450326
two times two times two . 450326_450871
two times two times two . 450871_452671
okay . 452671_454783
now if I want you to write this out as a solution, we could go two times two is four times two . 454783_460223
but I want you to write it out as a solution of a power . 460223_463051
what would this equal ? 463051_464371
two to the fifth power . 464371_469418
two to the fifth power . 469418_469970
okay . 469970_470511
then let's look at this . 470511_472443
what is this telling me now that I have parentheses ? 472443_474865
xxx . 474865_479200
well +... 479200_479831
you have to multiply it by +... 479831_480703
you have to do xxx . 480703_481511
two to the third power times two to the +... 481511_485568
third power . 485568_486025
third power . 486025_487543
right ? 487543_488295
we have because it's squared +... 488295_489756
what ? 489756_490210
oh, squared . 490210_491026
we're taking the inside and we're multiplying it twice . 491026_494211
right ? 494211_494650
yes, Lucia ? 494650_495915
is is that the same thing as doing two to the third power and then just, like, getting the answer +... 495915_503178
right now I'm not in terms of finding out what the actual value is . 503178_508041
I'm trying to find out what the power would be . 508041_510251
okay . 510251_510768
so I'm saying here I have two to the third power and it's squared . 510768_515993
so I have to take two to the third power and multiply it by itself twice . 515993_519554
right ? 519554_520018
mm hmm . 520018_520763
well, we can even break this down further and what is this ? 520763_523241
two +... 523241_523825
times two . 523825_524713
two times two . 524713_526226
and this is ? 526226_526791
<two times two times two> . 526791_527973
<two times two times two> . 527973_529446
and what do we get here if I write it as a final power ? 529446_532630
two to the sixth power . 532630_534355
two to the sixth power . 534355_535586
okay . 535586_537131
now for the last example, what's being squared here ? 537131_542900
the x@l . 542900_543795
one x@l . 543795_544101
the two . 544101_544660
two x@l . 544660_545203
two and x@l or just +... 545203_547683
two . 547683_548290
two . 548290_548715
two . 548715_549163
both of them . 549163_549801
this is +... 549801_550330
two x@l . 550330_550890
two x@l . 550890_551378
two times x@l times two times +... 551378_553688
x@l . 553688_554335
x@l . 554335_554773
or because we have the associative property in math, we go two times two, and x@l times x@l . 554773_562268
right ? 562268_562768
oh . 562768_563436
is that any different ? 563436_564060
yeah . 564060_564430
