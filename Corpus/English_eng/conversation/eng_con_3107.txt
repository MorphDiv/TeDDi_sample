the whole thing has to work . 140_1240
and . 1580_1800
see if we do that . 4420_5160
one . 5160_5320
right that one's not gonna work . 6210_8440
so &-um let's look at our design again . 9300_12240
let's see if there's a way you could get it . 12610_14720
see it all . 14860_15320
it's almost I think if we just adjust this one 'cause these look
and they will match . 21580_22880
and this one could fold down on this one . 22980_26160
and match . 26220_26720
can we find a way just for you to arrange this one in there so that
how will it . 34340_34840
have to be &-um let's see . 34840_48830
&-um . 49410_49630
oops . 50300_50590
that one got moved a little bit when you laid it down . 50620_52670
that's okay . 52670_53230
can you no . 53250_55990
all right . 58250_58510
thank you . 58510_58910
Ashley Nicole are we gonna need to &-um to visualize what your &-um
I started . 66190_66430
I have a this is signature . 67230_69350
oh well then we can't use that for this test . 69530_71470
'cause what we're trying to prove is can you start with a course
and make &-um a two by two design that is so . 77770_82470
&-um . 83530_83750
okay that course where you have in your hands right now . 84860_86950
is that symmetric or asymmetric . 87010_88830
okay . 91340_91630
do you think it would be possible . 92370_93830
can you lay that flat on the floor so we can all see it . 93930_96270
&-um it's kind of curled a little bit tiny two . 96770_98990
yeah . 99100_99390
that's nice . 99410_99990
I'm just flattening it out a little bit Nicole so that they can see
do you think it would be possible if you had three more of those
&-um yeah . 113770_119350
can you tell us a little bit about how that design might look . 120170_123510
we'll try very hard to visualize it with you . 123520_125830
&-um Quaia tell us what the design would look like . 135970_138150
what would the finish two by two that you made from four of those
okay . 143540_143830
so she wants you to imagine the design . 143830_145430
Nathan (th)em so you'll have to sit up and Teddy so will you she
so you're not in front of Brian she wants you to think about &-um
Nicole thanks . 158050_158710
she wants you to think about getting all four of the green squares
&-um if I get all four of the green squares in the center of that
&-um . 176690_176910
Sarah what should you be thinking . 183690_185200
about . 185200_185480
what are all of us thinking about . 189430_190840
right . 190840_191160
now . 191160_191320
Nicole can you tell Sarah what we're all trying to think about . 196380_198840
right now if this . 198840_200560
okay . 207430_207720
Nicole was asking you to visualize that Core Square repeated . 208340_212000
you know we waited a long time for you to tell us . 212180_214760
and you couldn't tell us what we were . 214860_216320
so . 216820_217040
now we're you . 217060_217800
why do you think so . 219820_220560
'cause if you put card all the time this up and down and sideways .
I I think the way you've just described for us . 246400_248800
I think Sarah's right . 248920_249760
you could take a course where it looked like this . 249760_251800
and do how you can't . 251980_253480
be using this right now . 253480_254680
you could do <copy core copy core copy core> copy core . 255340_258360
is that the way Nicole was asking us to think about arranging her
no . 262420_262640
how did Nicole want us to think about arranging her core squares .
she had a particular design in line that she asked us to think
if we <copy core copy core copy core> copy core with that
would the green squares end up in the middle . 278480_280160
no . 280740_280960
no . 281380_281600
if we did <copy core copy core copy core> copy core would it be
no . 286580_286800
yeah it would . 287510_288840
it would <copy core copy core copy core> copy core . 290420_294120
that would mean that if this was in the top &-um left hand corner .
then here would be a green square . 299670_301320
Sarah and here would be a and then here would be a green square . 301650_305800
and here would be a green square . 306300_307480
would that end . 307480_308120
up being put wanna put it would be symmetrical . 308120_313760
if you had all of these squares in the middle . 314020_316160
that's what Nicole was asking us to think about . 316540_318600
I'm glad that you agree with her . 318740_319920
Sarah thinks that &-um if you had just copied your core four times
but if you did what you suggested and turned and flipped your
so that you got those four green squares in the center . 331660_334120
you would have a symmetrical two way two design Justin what do . 334540_337600
you think other . 337600_338080
she could have a symmetrical two two design . 338180_339920
tell us about that . 339920_340720
&-um four green squares in the middle . 341020_342560
if she had them this way there would be four green . 342940_347200
&-um four green little . 352580_354760
how would four green little school . 355220_356480
oh okay . 357820_358720
because . 358720_359120
and then blue . 359940_360640
they could well they could I like this . 361470_369840
okay . 370950_371240
thinking . 372320_372880
thank you Nicole . 372880_373760
I . 373920_374040
he needs to let &-um Danny share what thinking did you do about
&-um this problem . 380780_381960
why were you gonna use that one to help you in your thinking . 383460_385840
Danny . 385840_386160
'cause this this one isn't &-um isn't &-um . 387120_392780
okay . 396250_396540
and do you think that if you had three more course words just like
that . 403930_404220
you would be able to make a symmetrical . 404220_405940
design . 406440_406860
why do you think so . 407760_408460
do you agree with &-um Danny do you think that if she had three
yes . 436800_437020
why do you think so . 438120_438900
her core square is definitely not symmetrical . 442040_444460
how_come she's gonna be able to make a symmetrical two by two if .
put all rectangles . 449000_455260
rec . 455920_456140
oh that wasn't the way she thought about . 457920_459420
so that means you think her way would work . 459440_461180
and the way with green rectangles in the middle would . 461360_463540
work or so . 463540_467180
then two grades would be two little square would on the . 467180_472100
and then if you flip it &-um that one could be on the outside of
this one . 479450_479940
okay . 481730_482020
as draft two . 482360_483060
&-um which core square were you using . 483720_485660
now you think . 485800_486540
&-um . 487400_487620
is that course square symmetrical or not symmetrical . 492480_495460
Kelly and Ashley if they school symmetrical this time we're trying
if you start with an asymmetric course where I do have one . 500360_502860
that's like that . 502860_503420
yes you do those three . 503680_504740
we can do the same thing for you that we did for Kelly and that we
we can visualize &-um or we can imagine . 509520_512060
oh wait . 512120_512540
did you you worked with Brittany mhm okay . 513160_515740
she has some here . 516120_517180
could he use one of yours for now . 517470_519180
and then put it back when he said . 519180_520220
can you show us a course . 520280_522340
&-um a two by two that's symmetrical made from your asymmetric &-um
okay . 532050_532340
is he making the same design as Brittany or different different
mhm . 536080_536440
but he is using the same force . 537500_539880
okay . 541450_541740
can you show us with your finger Asra two some lines of symmetry .
some lines we could fold on to and prove that you design as
okay . 550010_550300
is there any else . 550300_550980
Nicole saw one right away . 555320_556660
good job . 557050_557580
thank you . 557990_558420
Ms can you give that one piece back to Brittany so she can show us
thank you . 562030_562500
but Paul talk to us about what you did . 563920_565820
did you start with a Corer that was symmetrical . 566040_568100
yes . 569100_569320
okay . 569870_570160
okay . 571390_571680
and what did you create . 571680_573160
two by that is symmetrical . 576340_580960
show us where the line of symmetry would be . 580960_582880
okay . 583910_584200
are there any other lines of symmetry for your design . 584300_586360
we try it this way . 586380_587200
and it works . 587200_587840
okay . 588070_588360
but does it if it only has one line of symmetry as Paul's two by
yeah yes it's okay . 593280_595880
and diagonally . 597100_598760
I don't think we were Brittany you were . 599040_600080
