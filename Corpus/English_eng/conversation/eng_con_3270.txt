so now please answer these questions . 0_3128
all right ? 3128_3976
<that's a lot of questions> . 3976_4596
<for example> well, just go one by one . 4596_6035
you're going to have more time on Monday anyway . 6035_7956
all right . 7956_8291
but on number one, what what did you notice about the first five equations ? 8291_12573
when you graphed them what did you honestly notice about them all ? 12573_16135
they all had a slope . 16135_16988
they all went to the right . 16988_17725
they all went up and to the right . 17725_19596
yeah . 19596_20060
they had a +... 20060_20578
that's why we always said they had a positive slope because the positive number in front of x@l, all right ? 20578_25810
okay . 25810_27330
yeah, they were positive . 27330_29383
all right, ladies and gentlemen . 29383_30478
shh . 30478_31611
listen up . 31611_32486
wherever you are wherever you are, honestly guys, it really doesn't matter . 32486_39531
I really appreciate the effort you put in for me today . 39531_41970
that's the important thing . 41970_43723
what I'd like you to do what I'd like you to do now, whether you're done or not guys, I honestly hope that all of you have learned something today . 43723_54291
okay ? 54291_54705
so I want everyone now, on their own piece of paper I repeat, on your own piece of paper +... 54705_62451
do this quickwrite for the remaining part of the class . 62451_65121
on that same piece of paper . 65121_67361
and a few hints would be like, hey did you learn did you understand ? 67361_70715
did you understand something about slope maybe a little bit better ? 70715_74616
same paper ? 74616_75760
or y@l intercepts . 75760_76425
same paper . 76425_77153
or maybe you got better at making tables . 77153_79831
on the same piece of paper, yes sir . 79831_81848
any questions on that ? 81848_83976
all right, quickwrite time guys . 83976_86106
let's get that done . 86106_87210
can you check these ? 87210_90016
what's this skull and bones stuff ? 90016_92223
don't know . 92223_93200
nice drawing . 93200_93710
Jeremy ? 93710_94303
oh, you're waiting for me because we're done over here ? 94303_97151
yeah . 97151_97678
yeah . 97678_98055
let me let me see &~wh let me see the answers . 98055_101440
they're over here . 101440_102811
xxx . 102811_104756
okay . 104756_106228
but where's your own work, Dell ? 106228_110196
xxx . 110196_111485
I didn't know it was +... 111485_112083
and right now what are you supposed to be doing ? 112083_113190
I was doing that . 113190_113716
he was doing this . 113716_114230
I understand, but right now what are you supposed to be doing ? 114230_116301
we were waiting for you . 116301_117788
all right . 117788_118868
now that I'm here, what else could you be doing right now ? 118868_121525
what did I talk about on the board there ? 121525_123533
this . 123533_123973
quickwrite . 123973_124341
the quickwrite . 124341_124845
all right . 124845_125525
see, I can see quickly you haven't even finished graphing these yet, so I want you to do the quickwrite right now . 125525_131546
and then I expect better results on Monday . 131546_133963
I want you to finish this up on Monday . 133963_135483
fair enough ? 135483_135915
okay Jeremy ? 135915_138008
Mister Ormsby ? 138008_140593
number six, it says, what do you notice about the intersection between +... 140593_144360
ah, see now it gets a little interesting . 144360_146690
show me your equation two . 146690_147960
two is uh, down here . 147960_150016
show me your equation six . 150016_151833
now, one thing that hopefully you understand is see a line +... 151833_157351
those arrows mean they go on lines go on forever in both directions, right . 157351_160703
oh yeah . 160703_161175
so take your ruler +... 161175_162205
and let's &~ext actually extend this line . 162205_166181
be very careful . 166181_166751
be precise . 166751_168590
let's extend that line straight down . 168590_170720
okay . 170720_172471
go all the way down to there somewhere . 172471_175148
there you go . 175148_176920
good . 176920_180173
good . 180173_180758
good . 180758_181213
good . 181213_181580
now, that's good enough because the idea is, I'm asking about what ? 181580_186141
the intersection . 186141_188396
an intersection is where two lines +... 188396_190735
meet . 190735_191440
meet . 191440_191853
meet or cross each other, right ? 191853_192988
look where these two lines meet or cross . 192988_195285
what do you notice about the angles there ? 195285_196621
it's a right angle . 196621_200188
well said . 200188_201623
right ? 201623_203086
so now in mathematics, this is something I haven't mentioned yet, that's also called perpendicular . 203086_209236
have you guys heard about that before ? 209236_210491
yeah . 210491_210998
so these two lines, therefore you would say are ? 210998_214110
perpendicular . 214110_215150
they make right angles . 215150_217228
right ? 217228_218228
mm hm . 218228_218996
my pencil . 218996_221365
hi Mister Ormsby . 221365_226481
I screwed up on graph nine and +... 226481_226970
okay . 226970_227948
he's all +... 227948_228801
have you started your quickwrite yet Brittany ? 228801_235248
no, because I was doing the graphing and Nathan has all the answers, so I have to write down all the answers . 235248_239928
right now I want you to stop what you're doing and let's just say one paragraph now . 239928_245296
just write as much as you can . 245296_248280
I didn't learn anything . 248280_249601
all right . 249601_250111
you didn't learn you didn't know how learn how to make tables or understand slope or y@l intercept or anything like that ? 250111_257151
okay ? 257151_258665
I said xxx graph, I'm not gonna do it because I got messed up on the, um +... 258665_277003
it looks nice . 277003_277310
that looks nice . 277310_278008
on the +... 278008_278485
how come you crumpled it up ? 278485_279358
because I messed up . 279358_280310
oh, so you got a new one ? 280310_281191
yeah . 281191_282023
so on Monday you're going to redo it . 282023_283335
I'm I'm just trying to +... 283335_284645
maybe even use a ruler to draw your coordinate system . 284645_287743
make it look professional . 287743_288670
yeah . 288670_289221
do it all the way down . 289221_290143
over on your weekend . 290143_291165
okay . 291165_293421
I'm not going to be here . 293421_294950
okay . 294950_296253
we're getting our work done here, look . 296253_298095
last time ladies and gentlemen . 298095_301213
five, four, three, two, one, zero . 301213_305998
okay . 305998_306836
here's the deal . 306836_308308
because we're running short on time and since I'm going to follow up anyways on Monday, okay ? 308308_317301
and we're actually going to have a little discussion about not just graphing but also what I wanted you to discover about these lines, all right . 317301_326775
please make sure you put away all your work . 326775_330826
do not lose any of it . 330826_331465
where are we +... 331465_332416
do not turn in anything today because you're going to need it all Monday . 332416_335560
what do we do what do we do with this ? 335560_336663
can I trust you can your group trust you to fold that up and put it away somewhere ? 336663_340480
nope . 340480_340983
xxx in your backpack . 340983_342063
all right . 342063_342806
what do we do with these ? 342806_344501
