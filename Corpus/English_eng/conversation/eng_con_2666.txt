or plus or minus .
+, or page up page down .
&=laughs:multiple .
page up page down that's a good one that's what I . 35995_39635
I think that's like too many choices for me . 39755_41915
+, ⌊ okay I'll pick ⌋ one of (th)em .
okay my topic survey was on augmentative and alternative communication systems . 42355_48915
okay and the the first slide is what are augmentative and alternative communication systems or AAC devices . 49815_56335
and &-um they're designed for people who can't speak or write or have maybe a a problem with speaking or writing maybe they can't speak or write fully due to neuromuscular disease or injury . 57085_68825
an AAC user in communicating with other people and telling them what their wants and needs are . 69185_74165
and I also see this as an important safety measure in case of emergencies if someone can't communicate a situation or how they're feeling if an emergency comes up an AAC system can be a good source of safety . 75005_87245
there are two basic types of AAC systems . 89125_91365
&-um one is for conversational or speech needs and &-um some examples are if you wanna talk to friends and family or if you wanna talk on the telephone &-um if you're in a classroom or at work and just to specify what your wants and needs are . 91965_105525
and then there's also graphical or written needs that people have . 106025_109525
and that's if you wanna write letters or you have assignments or you would like to draw or do some sort of artistic work . 109745_115265
&-um people who can benefit from AAC devices are people with a damaged larynx or cerebral palsy ALS traumatic brain injury stroke and if you have &-um a spinal cord &~in injury and you can't use your hands then you can benefit from this . 116825_132605
the first device I'm gonna go over is &-um talking picture cards . 134305_138205
and the company that developed these specific cards are Crestwood Company . 138885_143785
and basically it's a way for someone to communicate with other people by pointing to the actual card that expresses their need . 144825_151045
&-um when you get a package of cards there's a hundred and fifteen functional cards in that package and there's eight different classifications that you have . 152185_160125
&-um they specify things about your room bathroom health any aids that you need food clothes people miscellaneous . 160625_167685
and there are five languages on the reverse side of the card or you can get sign language if you want and the cost is thirty one ninety five . 168335_174615
the pros about the picture cards is that they're easy to use and transport and you don't need fine motor control in_order_to use them . 176035_182975
&-um they're fairly inexpensive . 183935_185115
but with the picture cards you have a fairly limited vocabulary and you can only use these pictures so the picture may not show the exact need that the person needs or if the other person is looking at the picture they might not understand what the person wants from just looking at a specific picture . 185865_201445
or you may be communicating with someone that is vision impaired and can't see the picture very clearly and so then you're not communicating very effectively . 202265_208485
and also I thought with a hundred and fifteen cards you need to sort through a_lot in_order_to communicate . 209185_214425
so you're constantly like sorting through all these cards to get from one communication to the other . 215025_219565
so that can be difficult . 220085_221025
&-um Crestwood also has what they call Crestwood Passports and these are more specific to the talking picture cards . 222125_227725
but &-um they include items such as fast food supermarket shopping school recreation &-um casual dining personal needs drugstore shopping center and health . 228305_238405
and what these are is just it's a packet of portable book with specific &-uh pictures in there so you can go and do a specific activity and the one I have is an example of fast food items . 239065_250065
and I found this on their website . 250945_252945
this is a lady named Mary and &-um she has a limited vocabulary and people have difficulty understanding her and she has the fast food passport . 253545_261305
and here it shows her going to Wendy's for the first time and ordering her meal by herself . 262005_265725
&-um the passports have about forty four picture cards each and they come in a portable book and it's twenty three ninety five per passport . 267925_275325
&-um the pros I see are that cards are specialized for a certain activity and they're inexpensive but &-um you know once you leave Wendy's or McDonald's or whatever you can't &~u really use your fast food passport anymore so it's very specific and you hafta have a_lot_of these passports . 276495_290615
and Crestwood Company also has what they call Crespeaker . 291915_294295
it's a handheld device and you can type in words phrases and sentences and it will speak them for you . 294635_301235
it also translates from English to Spanish and Spanish to English . 301815_305455
and they show people using this on the telephone . 306275_308855
so they'll hold the device up to the phone receiver and actually talk with the device . 309195_313735
&-um it's also very small and easy to operate you can enter up a hundred characters which is about eighteen words and there are also built+in phrases about four hundred and two built+in phrases . 314495_325155
they basically advertise this device not only for people with communication difficulties but if you're traveling or you're learning English or Spanish as a second language they also &-um +... 326455_337035
they also &~s you know promote this device for that . 340235_342735
&-um and it has a male voice and it's three hundred and seventy nine dollars and ninety five cents . 343595_347895
so it's +//. 348275_349335
good thing about it is it's compact and has large number of built+in phrases for the user and you can also type and enter in phrases so you don't hafta use all the preprogrammed phrases that they have . 349605_358945
but &-um it is a compact design so you'd need some fine motor control in_order_to use it . 360185_364865
if you couldn't target very well you might not be able to press all the buttons and type in what you wanted . 365365_369845
and it only has a male voice so that's bad if you're a &~s a child or female . 370405_374165
you might not wanna talk with a male voice . 374925_376505
&-um Enabling Devices has a device called a portable talking ID which you can wear around your neck and record a twenty second message on your name address phone any special needs . 377185_388625
and &-um this is basically used in case there's an emergency then somebody can press the device and you know find out who you are and if you have any special needs and what they need to do in that emergency . 389745_400125
&-um it's very simple and effective easy to activate it's also very visible . 401105_405485
so people can see it if there is an emergency . 406145_408605
but it could be a nuisance wearing this &-um big device around your neck around your clothing . 409385_413385
and also if you don't use it every day or check it every now and then you may forget you need to replace the batteries . 414205_420645
and then you're wearing this thing . 420785_422025
and it doesn't work anyway when the emergency comes up . 422125_424725
another device made by Enabling Devices is a Step Talk . 426685_429865
and here it has a series of prerecorded messages that are +//. 430985_434145
have a seven seventy five second limit . 434445_436205
so allows people to carry on a conversation with these prerecorded messages . 437085_440865
and that's ninety dollars . 441445_442445
&-um it's inexpensive and easy to use but with the prerecorded messages you don't have a_lot_of flexibility in communicating you have to basically use what the device already offers . 443425_452785
and here's a device by Frame Technologies it's called a Book Talker it looks like a book and there're six different levels of messages that you can go to and from with &-um the manual switch on the right hand side . 454315_468035
okay it also has optical level changing in addition to that or I guess instead of the manual switch I don't have a picture of that . 468095_478375
and &-um when the page is turned the Book Talker knows which level it's on and there are six levels with twenty four messages each level . 478995_489055
so two hundred and eighty eight messages total . 489595_491175
and this device is five hundred dollars . 491515_492995
one of the good things about this is that you have organized levels of messages so when you get used to the Book Talker you're probably really good at switching from different levels and using those levels . 495035_503775
and also the fact that it has optical level changing you don't need accurate motor control or if you don't have any &-um control of your arms or hands then this would be a very good device . 504485_513565
&-um but it is fairly expensive and again it has all prerecorded messages so there aren't messages that you can come up with yourself . 514385_521725
&-um Frame Technologies also has voice in a box . 523025_525145
this is almost a simpler design there are only sixteen messages on the screen and three point seven five seconds each message which is actually fairly short . 525445_534045
&-um but it is easy to use and record and it has a light so you know when you're recording the messages . 534905_540025
&-um it's a hundred and ninety five dollars and I see this as a good device for someone that doesn't have fine motor control and can't target very easily because there are large and easy to use buttons on this device . 540945_553865
but it does have minimal message capabilities . 554385_556365
&-um there's a device called Say_It_All by Innocomp . 558385_560965
this is actually a little more advanced . 561145_562565
it has what they call a speech synthesizer where you can choose different voices and you can also choose the pitch of the voice and different sounds and so you can really customize what voice you want it to have . 563105_574565
there's a lookup table of over sixteen thousand nouns . 575585_578465
&-um they have new technology that allows the user to type in any name city state country and have it spoken correctly without resorting to phonetic spellings . 579325_588225
they also have clarity speech which gives a human sounding text to speech . 588635_593995
and as I said before it's available in male or female female voice and you can alter the pitch voice volume . 595435_600835
and it has ability to have an &~unlim unlimited vocabulary (be)cause you can use text text to speech or you can use their stored phrases . 601915_608655
&-um something they promote this device for is that it's ideal if you have changing communication needs if your communication needs change through time then this device can adapt to that . 610105_622005
and also allows some flexibility if you have multiple users +... 623005_626185
it's lightweight two and a quarter pounds it's very &~s very lightweight . 626465_633305
and has eight hundred and forty six definable phrases . 634105_636525
the device costs about two thousand dollars and if you want the speech synthesizer so that you can customize your own voice then it's thirty five hundred . 637485_645885
so the pros are that it offers a great deal of flexibility and speech capacity but it's extremely expensive . 646605_651265
and the last device I had was the Pathfinder . 652465_655545
&-um this has a color display and also has touch screen technology . 656285_660245
and you can use an infrared head pointing access for the &~key keyboard . 661185_664545
and this also has this &~thyn synthesized speech . 665655_668055
that comes with it . 668795_669595
&-um users can upload and download information from computer disks onto this device . 670995_674975
and it also has notebook and journal function for writing letters or papers and a text editor . 675735_680375
it also has calculator clock and word prediction . 680815_683275
and it's about four and a half pounds +... 683855_685255
&-um it also incorporates a couple different things language activity monitoring which basically records language events so that you can see the progress the person is making with their communication tool through time . 688825_701645
and again it has a infrared head pointing device that you can use but this device is eight thousand dollars . 702985_709765
which is very pricy . 710085_711485
&=laughs so &-um the pros are that you do have head pointing access and unlimited capabilities with this device but it's really comes &~a at an outrageous price . 712445_720785
okay there're some areas of research that I saw with AAC systems the first one is dynamic display . 722205_728425
so instead of having just &-um a static picture on a sheet of paper or <on the> on the display of the AAC device the they will have a dynamic display where the pictures change depending on your selection . 728575_740515
and there are also there's a_lot_of work being done on optical control or different &-um types of control for the &~di device rather than just using your hands . 741815_749355
and also there's a_lot_of &-uh research being done on increasing the performance and efficiency of the devices . 750215_755195
so that they can incorporate more words into the device and be more effective communication tools . 755855_760535
&-um one research area I saw by InvoTek is a laser that will point &~as at a laser sensing surface and acts as the keyboard . 761355_769175
and the last thing that I found by InvoTek at Michigan State University this one's actually pretty slick it's &-um what the device does is it listens to a conversation between the AAC user and the person they're talking to and actually tries to predict what the AAC user will say next . 770055_788495
and so it helps them formulate sentences so they don't hafta use as many key strokes when they communicate with another person . 788995_795155
so that's that's kinda interesting . 795535_797335
and then &-um and my references . 798075_800055
are there any questions ?
(0.5) .
just one comment that &-uh the Pathfinder from what I understand is pretty cool &-uh +/. 800615_812275
⌈ yeah and it's really slick ⌉ .
+, ⌊ there's like a six month waiting list ⌋ to get (th)em &-uh they're all the rage . 812435_816995
yeah I mean I think if if &-um you needed that device eight thousand dollars I mean in a way it's like what's money ? 817635_825775
but you know if you really +/. 826175_827715
⌈ you don't have it ⌉ +/.
+, ⌊ need it and it's ⌋ but yeah but if you don't have it then you can't really say that . 827995_831835
&=laughs yeah <it looks> it looks like this is the best device I've seen out there . 832495_835915
+, mm +/.
+, yeah +... 836895_837215
is that it ? 840475_840695
⌈ okay ⌉ .
⌊ anybody ⌋ else ? 841635_842255
&=applause:multiple .
yay .
gee I don't remember too many other people getting applause . 852535_854475
you're just extra special .
xxx .
oh okay .
&=laughs you want me to just leave my disk in here ?
or (0.7) okay . 856275_859155
(0.11) .
let's see so &=break_in_recording and we will pick this up next time . 883945_896985
(0.7) so Marissa you're up . 896985_913845
alright .
(0.13) I had &-um the distinct pleasure of playing with the Alpha Talker . 921535_926255
&-um the Alpha Talker is &-uh a basically it's an introductory augmentative &-um communication aid and it uses Minspeak which I'll describe in a minute &-um to store and retrieve messages . 926635_940835
&-um really it's meant &-uh the users are kind of beginners this is probably their first &-uh communication system that's you know computer based . 942635_951495
&-um and it really allows you to learn at your own pace . 952495_954635
xxx &=laughs alright the basic package &-um basically &-uh comes with you know it's this which is a key guard your actual computer base &-um overlay which is this is a sample overlay they also give you several blank ones so you can kinda make up your own stuff . 958365_976685
&-um if you +//. 977845_978765
the memory basically can store about three and a half minutes of speech at &-uh high quality and five and a quarter minutes of speech for &-um lower quality or standard quality . 978865_990905
&-uh it comes with &-uh thirty two keys you can also get it in four which is this one here or eight which they didn't have &-um there but you can also get it in eight . 991625_1000485
and you can get optional memory packages that are you know give you fourteen and half minutes of standard speech . 1000945_1007205
&-um but the memory package is about nine hundred dollars more &-uh at least . 1007925_1011185
&=laughs:S3 that's what it's was on the website and the website actually had all the information on the Alpha Two and this is the Alpha One . 1011845_1017165
the Alpha Two is about two grand for a base and then you add a whole bunch of options if you want the extra memory it it's it's a pretty expensive little toy . 1017585_1024685
&-um on the front of the Alpha Talker we have a couple things I wanna point out one of which is the control panel which is this little guy right here . 1025795_1032255
&-uh this control panel lets you do just about everything that's on here &-um that it can do . 1033035_1037335
it lets you select &-um if you're using a thirty two xxx four location keyboard it lets you &-uh switch between your input devices . 1037475_1045235
you can use switches keyboards head pointing . 1045555_1048015
&-um it also lets you store and record all of your messages review your messages and erase &-uh whatever messages you want to erase off of here . 1048595_1057815
on the back of it you can see that it's got a bunch of little things here this you know you've got your battery charger you've got a dual &-um control which you can plug in &-um either a dual switch or a head pointer we've got a microphone so +//. 1058815_1072855
there is a microphone in the control panel this little black thing here is a microphone but if you want an external mic for better recording &-uh you can plug that in here . 1072885_1081045
&-um there is a switch here that allows you . 1081745_1084405
it's &-um allows you to connect up to a computer so you can end up storing &-um things you have in memory . 1084605_1091285
&-uh you can the memory on here you can actually store onto a disk . 1091845_1094905
is you can have three or four different types of &-um &~i three or four different overlays . 1095045_1099805
you can have the memory associated with each overlay in a computer . 1099865_1102385
&-um you also have another &~sw this is a mono button . 1103325_1105985
for the &~s for a single switch you have external speakers you can put in here . 1106245_1109665
you have a jack for headphones . 1110085_1111025
you have a speaker volume &-um adjustability so that's the &~sp you know the volume that it'll speak to someone else . 1111505_1116425
but then you also have an ear volume so in case you know if you have a headphone or something like that that you're listening with and you use some of their auditory prompts &-um you can hear it at &-uh specialized volumes +... 1116545_1126985
alright . 1129905_1130345
do do do . 1130665_1133285
&-um as I said before you can plug it in &-um the battery does charge and it does hold a charge so I'll be able to kinda hold it up for you guys . 1133865_1141685
&-um turning it on and off is pretty simple it's right here in the control panel &-um &=device_beeps gives a little beep . 1142245_1149385
&-uh now this is +//. 1149985_1151065
these buttons up here are really kind_of hard &~t hard even for me to press down so I wouldn't really imagine that someone who's actually gonna be using this device unless they have very good motor control &-um is actually gonna be using the control panel this kinda stuff is going to be left for the caregiver . 1151085_1166065
&-um and it automatically powers down after two minutes that's the the setting that it's on &-um you can change that however by going into the toolbox . 1167085_1174705
alright let's talk a little bit about Minspeak . 1175225_1178245
you see all these little icons on on the keyboard here . 1178065_1181705
well they don't necessarily mean anything until you put meaning to them . 1182065_1185565
so basically what Minspeak does is you can take a combination of one two or three different icons and make a phrase . 1186085_1194985
and &-um so basically you can store a large number of messages with only a few keystrokes . 1196185_1201925
so &-um let's see if we can demo something here . 1202505_1205505
&-um &=pressing_buttons I &{l=DEVICE_SPEAKING I want to play with Sammy . 1206195_1213015
&}l=DEVICE_SPEAKING and that was this +//. 1213815_1214435
that was three key strokes so you have &=pressing_buttons I want to play with a person &{l=DEVICE_SPEAKING I want to play with Sammy . 1214655_1220595
&}l=DEVICE_SPEAKING and you can see that &-um the the messages that are they're recorded in a nonsynthesized speech they're actually someone's voice that's actually me . 1221175_1228175
&-um but there's other ones here too . 1228815_1230775
&=pressing_buttons &{l=DEVICE_SPEAKING I do not want to go to bed . 1231815_1233515
&}l=DEVICE_SPEAKING so you can actually have you know if you wanna record a child's voice or you wanna record a a man's voice you kinda have your option as to what voice you wanna put into it . 1233975_1242235
and you can &~exchan or you're you can change the expression and some of the intonation with different things so it gives you a little bit more flexibility so if you wanna have like an exclamation point cowabunga or something like that you can kind_of have that inflection in your voice . 1242635_1255395
&-um and then you know if you wanna just have a single key &{l=DEVICE_SPEAKING I like money . 1255975_1260095
&}l=DEVICE_SPEAKING &=laughs:multiple so you can have a single key too . 1261635_1263355
&-um now with Minspeak however <if you> &-um if you have a three key sequence but you also have you have maybe two keys like you know &=pressing_buttons I like to play with Sammy . 1264175_1275415
&{l=DEVICE_SPEAKING I want to play with Sammy . 1275715_1277135
&}l=DEVICE_SPEAKING okay but you also wanna say let's play and maybe you don't wanna say with Sammy or with another friend . 1277515_1282635
&=pressing_buttons &{l=DEVICE_SPEAKING let's play . 1283615_1285755
&}l=DEVICE_SPEAKING you actually have to press the last button twice . 1286315_1289015
so you know the more complex you get with these sequences the more cognitive ability your user needs to have . 1289635_1295915
and &-um that gets into the toolbox a little bit . 1296695_1299735
we can change how much we need &-um how much cognitive ability we need to be able to use this . 1300055_1306075
&-um what you actually do is you go into your little control panel here and you want to press this option select until you get to the tools &=pressing_buttons and now we're in the toolbox . 1306655_1315495
so what I'm gonna do is open it up +... 1315915_1318115
&=pressing_buttons and right now as you can see there are some buttons lit up . 1321595_1325655
and each of these &-uh things has like a name on it . 1325835_1328795
and &-um there's &-uh like this one here is the setting the scanning speed . 1329415_1333695
you can also scan with this &-um setting the acceptance time that's actually how long you can hold down a button before it actually activates . 1333875_1341995
and let's say we wanna set that acceptance time &=pressing_buttons to something a little bit slower so let's make it to point oh five . 1342555_1350035
the standard's point oh one so it's basically a press and a release . 1350855_1353775
&-um you can also set &-um different types of scanning you can if you want to do a row column scan you do need to have an external &~s you need to have a switch for that and &-uh there's no switch here to really demonstrate it . 1354515_1366415
but &-um basically it would you know it just scans across the rows and then you select the row with your switch and then it would scan across the columns . 1366475_1373955
&-um but you can also make it do a circular or linear motion so if you had maybe four instead of thirty two buttons you might have four or eight it might make more sense to just make it go in a circle and just scan each one . 1374655_1385475
&-um the lights you can either put on with auto or you can put it on hold &-um auto means that it'll come on when &-uh they'll come on when selected and hold it'll stay on &-um let's see here &-uh +//. 1386235_1402855
what there was one thing I wanted to +//. 1403355_1404335
okay . 1405055_1405575
the biggest the +... 1405875_1406875
&-um the icon &~sel prediction and selection we wanna make sure these two things are on . 1408095_1413675
&-uh what this does is actually it'll only light up +//. 1414145_1417125
the icon prediction will only light up things that are active so things that you've stored messages in . 1417385_1421885
so if I stored a message in +... 1422925_1425285
in this little guy here his light would be on . 1426005_1430545
but let's say we don't have any messages stored under this one here as the first key then that light wouldn't be on okay ? 1430765_1436985
and then as soon as I press him anything that is is a second button after him in that sequence will light up . 1437225_1444765
so you'll kinda see well after him I can press maybe there's four buttons and I'll show you that in a minute . 1445265_1449665
but then the predictive selection &-um turns on only those keys that have the light lit . 1450165_1457085
so if I press a button that doesn't have a light on it won't even recognize that I've pressed that button . 1458205_1463265
so it kinda helps you if you're making mistakes or anything like that . 1463615_1466535
and then you can also &-um &=pressing_buttons turn on or off the beep feedback which I'm going to turn off right now . 1467195_1471795
so then we put this guy back on +... 1473095_1475375
and he's upside+down +...
alright .
then we need to get outta the toolbox . 1478735_1484915
(0.8) alright .
and then you have to press a key to activate now I'm gonna put I'm gonna put the head pointer in just so I can show you a little bit how that works . 1492395_1499355
and we have have to turn the head pointing on which it is actually already . 1499495_1505555
and normally this would be attached to some sort of like &-um headband or something to kinda control it with your head but since it's you know that'd be kind of difficult for you to see I'm actually just gonna use my hand . 1506595_1519975
and it is actually very difficult I tried it and I had a very difficult time targeting and holding it there and everything like that . 1520275_1526535
so let's say we wanna say &-um (0.8) &{l=DEVICE_SPEAKING who's that ? 1527095_1538735
&}l=DEVICE_SPEAKING who's that so we have the question mark we hadta find it hold it find it hold it &{l=DEVICE_SPEAKING who's that ? 1539075_1545235
&}l=DEVICE_SPEAKING and it would it'd tell you &~wh you know ask who's that ? 1545925_1548605
&-um so basically it's it's very similar to pressing the button and when the head pointer's on you can also press buttons . 1549525_1555065
so +... 1555525_1555545
&=pressing_buttons &{l=DEVICE_SPEAKING I want to play with Ginny . 1557545_1560485
&}l=DEVICE_SPEAKING so anyway that's how the head pointing works . 1561045_1563465
&-um but then you also need to be able to store and retrieve messages . 1563705_1568985
so in_order_to store or retrieve we need to go back into our toolbox and let's say we wanna say hm what do we wanna say ? 1570015_1579295
let's just make a a simple one . 1580335_1582475
and we're just gonna do one button . 1582935_1584035
so I'm gonna press store that light comes on and then all I do is I press the key sequence I want and then I press record . 1584255_1591495
&=pushing_button cool . 1592455_1592755
oop my memory's full . 1593695_1594555
so I actually have to go through and erase something if I want to go and store that . 1594725_1599045
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna press a key here (0.4) &{l=DEVICE_SPEAKING I want to play with Sammy . 1599985_1609865
&}l=DEVICE_SPEAKING and we're gonna erase that . 1610305_1611285
so all I have to do is press the key sequence press erase it'll beep and then I press erase again and then it goes through and erases . 1611645_1618325
now if you want to review every single one of the messages and you want to erase them one by one it takes a very long time because you just press this review button and you &~k and it basically will go through at this corner and go through every single combination that you have for this one button here . 1618695_1634195
so it and it'll if it stops erasing . 1634895_1637975
it takes a while to actually erase the messages once that erase light goes out I can continue . 1638655_1642475
&-um but that's how you erase and record . 1643175_1648495
and you can also &-uh as I was saying <you can use remote> &~headsw you can use remote switches you can use &-um like if you have an eight keypad you can use eight different switches that all come in &~may maybe have one you know relate to one position on that key pad . 1650155_1666695
&-um you can also use this as a keyboard emulator by &-um &~pu loading in a specific program into this and putting an overlay with letters on it it hooks into the computer and it also does that &-um you can also alright yeah . 1667725_1684605
here's a reviewing of the messages . 1685625_1686845
&{l=DEVICE_SPEAKING a@l one . 1687385_1687865
g@l one . 1688505_1689345
do it again . 1690185_1691305
a@l one . 1692165_1692945
h@l one . 1693565_1694385
I want it . 1695825_1696565
&}l=DEVICE_SPEAKING now the a@l one h@l one all those things <those are> &-um those are called auditory prompts and you can actually change those you can personalize them to your specific &-um Alpha Talker keyboard . 1696925_1707285
so if you want this auditory prompt to be me then you can change that simply by going into the toolbox selecting your auditory prompts and then going from there . 1707705_1717345
so those things like let's say you couldn't see very well or you couldn't focus on things you could actually have an earphone and you can turn on auditory prompt so anytime you hit something it'll tell you what it is and then you press it again to select it . 1717765_1729645
and in it's very useful when scanning (be)cause it'll go down and scan the rows and it'll tell you the first icon in each row alright ? 1730305_1747585
&-um one other thing you can also do themes where you can actually set .
say alright let's say I'm in the house theme .
so that means that every button that every first button hasta do with house .
so then when you set the theme to be the house they don't ever have to press that as the first button .
they just have to press the second and third buttons . 1754045_1755905
&-um and that can be handy &-uh sometimes however the person can't switch outta that mode unless they can work the control panel . 1756825_1762485
so &-um a few of the pros and cons I saw it was a little bit difficult &-um to review the messages it was hard to &-um &~contr use the control panel without real good motor control and targeting . 1763325_1774945
&-um you really need to have a_lot_o(f) thought into stuff before you start recording just because of all the overlapping symbols and things like that you wanna know exactly what this person needs to say . 1775705_1783725
&-um and then the clarity of the recording can be difficult the recordings you heard are all on the high quality so that would only be it'd only give you three and a half minutes of recording time . 1784465_1794145
however there're some of the pros are that it's it is real speech . 1794985_1797645
it sounds more natural . 1797785_1798565
you can put some inflection into your voice . 1798765_1800265
&-um the icons make you know &~mem remembering things somewhat easy . 1800665_1803365
and it's very customizeable . 1803885_1804965
you can customize your scanning speed . 1805085_1806645
you can customize your acceptance rates . 1806865_1808505
&-um you can put stickers on things . 1808985_1810845
you can have <all sorts of> &-um all sorts of things that you can change to the way you like them and what you need them for . 1810945_1816985
alright &-um any questions ? 1818045_1819245
(0.4) and there's a_lot more that I could have done with this guy &=laughs:multiple there was so much stuff I was like . 1821865_1826985
okay I'm curious how do you connect eight different switches to that machine ? 1827005_1830045
you connect eight switches through either +//. 1830585_1833145
I think it's this one . 1833305_1834105
y@l .
uhuh .
yeah .
yeah it it's actually +//. 1834405_1836825
they had &-um a price for the eight different switch is a hundred and twenty five dollars for the extra large targets . 1837055_1843615
I think that's why we don't have xxx . 1921795_1921855
yeah &=unintelligible_speech_until_end . 1921855_1921995
