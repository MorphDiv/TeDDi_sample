Shall we have a nice cup of tea . 1246142_1248222
I was gasping Especially when that man was . 1248222_1251232
Rabbitting . 1252162_1252442
Yeah which I did n't understand any of it . 1252442_1254312
No . 1254312_1254612
Pension mortgages and this mortgage and and he did n't really know
Yeah . 1261692_1261782
that foreign lady was quite amused She was laughing when you were
Oh . 1266302_1266532
as if to say ah ah he 's not sure what he 's doing He 's got
0 .
Instead of just sitting there and quoting all these figures . 1275102_1277472
yeah . 1277472_1277532
and blinding you with science . 1277532_1279652
Yeah . 1279982_1280332
Somebody who can ask questions and knew what he was talking about .
Yeah . 1284762_1284862
And she was giggling away She kept raising her eyebrows and
Well I could n't see her cos I had my back turned . 1290142_1292092
No you had your back to her . 1292092_1293012
Yeah . 1293162_1293382
But I could see behind you and she was . 1293382_1296392
Well there you are When you do know a bit about it you yes you want
Well that 's it You 're not and you 're not gon na be blinded by
I did n't know what on about there I I think he got his . 1316222_1319692
said that . 1319692_1319922
Oh he knew what he was talking about but . 1319922_1322112
But you were confusing him because you knew where he 's used to
Well you see the thing is they they they . 1327772_1329042
And you knew what he was on about . 1329042_1330442
they quote this unit linked business Now it 's all . 1330612_1334032
And you did n't want that did you . 1334032_1335292
well and good a unit linked policy but as I said to you before that
And you have n't got enough money . 1344102_1345422
you could you can lose a th I do n't want one . 1345482_1348232
0 .
If the market crashes the day before you take your policy 's due to
But do you think this thing what he was on about pension mortgage
No . 1366812_1366872
Is that what it means . 1366872_1367702
pep 's different . 1367702_1368412
Oh Is it similar . 1368782_1369972
pep 's a personal equity plan . 1369972_1371552
Oh Sorry . 1372372_1372712
Which is different To be perfectly honest in my current situation .
Mhm . 1383852_1383912
a pension mortgage would be more advantageous . 1383972_1387852
Well that 's the most important thing is n't it . 1388062_1391012
At the moment Because well I 'm not in a pension scheme at work But
Yeah . 1397572_1397632
if I want to . 1397672_1398932
Mhm . 1399682_1399762
Erm the only problem is well even s even not so much now because
Mm . 1437742_1437952
Erm so it it it it 's difficult . 1438642_1441572
Mm I know you can take them along with you nowadays ca n't you and
You can now take now now now you can take them with you . 1444402_1447682
Mm Where they used to be frozen and then you started another one
That 's right That 's right Whereas now . 1451002_1452332
And you ended up with three four d silly little bits and pieces did
Yeah Yeah Whereas now you see all the they can put them all into
Yeah I know you can take them with you now . 1458582_1460222
Mm So in a way I think . 1462942_1464152
And it was a lot less money as well was n't it . 1464152_1465862
I mm yeah but that w do n't forget . 1465862_1467262
It started . 1467322_1467592
that was sixty five . 1467592_1468912
Yeah . 1469012_1469212
The quotation he give was sixty five and as he said which is true
Mm . 1477692_1477752
more And that 's why I said when it sounded so low that 's why I I
And and a cash sum at the end of it . 1489372_1490772
Still think it 's low . 1490772_1492372
Seems quite does n't seem a lot does it . 1492372_1494752
No I 'm pretty certain . 1494822_1496652
And would you still have to have an insurance on top of that . 1496652_1498852
You have to have term assurance . 1498852_1500452
So you 'd still have to have . 1500452_1501892
You 'd have . 1501902_1502112
you 'd have the two hundred pound and then you 'd have a life
No no no No That was it two hundred and twelve pound . 1504492_1507242
The whole lot . 1507242_1508702
The whole lot . 1508702_1509642
Well why does n't everybody have them then . 1509642_1511332
Because not everybody 's eligible for them . 1511622_1514092
I know but they did n't he did n't suggest it to you or why does
Did n't ask . 1526862_1527512
Rather than a . 1527742_1527862
Did n't ask the questions . 1527872_1529702
I know exactly But surely that 's . 1529702_1531052
He did n't he . 1531052_1531322
his job If he 's trying to find you the cheapest . 1531322_1533412
He 's not doing his job Basically . 1533422_1535762
Exactly . 1536162_1536302
he 's not doing his job . 1536312_1537612
Because a young couple going in well even in our situation you have
He did n't he he did n't ask the question Which he should have
Mm Exactly Yeah because it is cheaper and . 1555072_1557282
You see the thing is you see I mean wh wh when this law came out
Mm . 1583742_1583912
But he did n't ask me the questions He just he just he just . 1583912_1590622
No he just could do an endowment one and that was it . 1590622_1592672
he just assumed it was gon na be . 1592672_1594742
An an endowment policy and endowment mortgage and that was it He
No Well you see when he said your base is gon na be . 1599392_1604282
I know . 1604282_1604372
a hundred and two hundred . 1604372_1605852
Ninety six . 1605852_1606212
and fifteen pounds or whatever . 1606212_1607592
Two hundred and five and then that on a ninety six . 1607672_1609712
And then a percent I could get you a percent off as a first time
Mm . 1613352_1613452
That brings it down to a hundred and ninety six for the first year
Yeah . 1619192_1619282
Not I know all that 's that 's obvious . 1619282_1620592
That 's quite clear Mm . 1620602_1621262
But then when he said two hundred and one pounds for a pension
That 's only five pound a month to earn your pension . 1630362_1632112
if a hu if a hundred and ninety six is only your base how come you
That gives you five pound a month towards your pension which is
how do you get two how do you get two hundred and one pounds or two
What 's term assurance Do n't understand that . 1655062_1657462
Term assurance is life insurance just on life only With no cash sum
Well if you died you 'd be dead Well that 's fair enough is n't it
But er throughout throughout the term of my life . 1666442_1668222
And if you died the would be paid . 1669432_1671002
If I died a lump sum of thirty thousand pounds is payable . 1671002_1675482
That 's it you 'd pay . 1675492_1678632
But I think fourteen pounds a month is quite high Term assurance I
What and arrange your own . 1690912_1692512
Well . 1692512_1692542
Or he 'd just tell you . 1692542_1693972
well I whether I I do n't know whether he would or whether he would
No that 's it . 1706452_1706702
him before Not on that sort of thing but other things as well sort
Mm . 1717292_1717352
I 'd like to know before you know . 1717362_1722432
You 've got to get the right deal . 1722442_1723462
Yeah I I did two hundred and one pound a month or two hundred and
Yeah but that 's not that much a we . 1737772_1738802
I suppose it 's the term of years . 1738892_1739962
It 's only three quid a m a week . 1739972_1741422
Yeah but I suppose it 's the term of years as well You sort of to
Well that 's it . 1746032_1747642
So that probably makes it but I say without having me own book to
Mm . 1753502_1753532
I ca n't tell you You see you can you get a lot you can get tax
Well he said you could get tax relief on the whole lot . 1759762_1761292
On the whole lot yeah . 1761292_1762622
That 's what he said At twenty five percent . 1762632_1764722
At twenty five percent I think you still I 'm not sure whether they
Well that 's what he said did n't he . 1769002_1770072
Yeah . 1771442_1771472

0 .
And so mine mine was higher . 2081142_2083912
Yeah . 2084492_2084652
than er than other peoples which is why he went to all these bloody
See the thing yeah As I say the thing the thing is as I say it 's
He sorted it all out But he was really good . 2090672_2092952
Yeah Your mortgage it does n't matter who your mortgage is with
Mm . 2099292_2099422

But when you buy a council house it is slightly different in as
Oh yeah yeah yeah . 2105672_2108112
Then also he also gave me I mean I got hundred percent mortgage
Yeah Yeah . 2124162_2124372
So I borrowed over what the house was worth But that was only
Discount Yeah . 2131852_2133502
worth more . 2133572_2134372
Yeah . 2134372_2134512
than what I was paying for it . 2134512_2135772
Yeah . 2136202_2136332
Cos I got a discount so er I borrowed another thousand pound . 2136332_2139462
To cover your costs . 2139462_2140362
to cover all the costs for the survey for Maxie 's and and this
Mm As I say it does n't matter what building . 2150612_2151832
Anyway he borrowed all that for me . 2151832_2153232
it does n't matter what building society you go to you 're gon na
Mm . 2167982_2168252
depending on the building society at the time It 's the life policy
Mm . 2172492_2172662
that makes the difference . 2173792_2175062
But to go to somebody like him who knew his job . 2175062_2178482
Mm . 2178542_2178752
which was his job and and had everything there and he he patched

Mm Mm . 2191092_2192602
That he could get all these to find out what he thought was the

He really you know made me feel I say I were n't sat there like I

Which is what the impression I got about him he was n't really sure
Mm . 2225152_2225342
But I think that was partly you floored him because you knew . 2225342_2227892
Yeah Yeah . 2228202_2229202
He sort of was a bit you got him a bit could n't say But certainly

Mm mm . 2247032_2247202
and and and I ended up with er a reasonable . 2247202_2253672
Was yours an endowment Or just . 2254112_2258372

Well I I I yeah I mean obviously I 'd have to pay more er for if I
Mm But even then it wo n't be will it be that much . 2505702_2507172
To get to get a higher lump sum To get a higher lump sum But then
Would it be that much more . 2510192_2511132
Should n't think so . 2511142_2512452
Well exactly So it 's gon na . 2512452_2513242

It 's cheaper than we 're paying now is n't it . 2572272_2574422
Mm Even if it 's two hundred and fifty it the same . 2574422_2576342
