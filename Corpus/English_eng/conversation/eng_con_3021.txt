first they were talking about flips and turns which is what I
no . 25316_26100
no . 26100_27166
what did we know more about flips or turns ? 27166_29823
turns . 29823_31286
+< flips ! 31286_31653
turns ! 31653_32755
we knew more about flips when we were building the model
+< turns . 35540_35823
+< turns . 35823_36231
why do you say we knew more about turns Brittany ? 36231_38391
well because we um because um because we used Logo for our turns
okay tell me a little bit more about that how does Logo make use of
well um if you wanted to make a square you'd have to have turns in
+< mmhm . 58723_58975
why do I have to have turns to make a square ? 58975_61310
tell me more . 61310_61925
well because you don't want just a you can't make a square
okay . 74590_75206
so um Logo uses turns xxx . 75206_80096
+< okay what kind of turns did we use let's let someone else um
+^ Brittany got you started thinking about Logo and turns she says
+^ Kelly what do you know about the turns we use in Logo ? 96550_99118
I think there something else on our communities you know we did
+< mmhm . 107315_107581
mmhm . 107581_108183
we did it kind of like go right one fourth and stuff . 108183_114620
+< mmhm . 114600_114620
did we say go right one fourth or &~di +/. 114620_116585
+< turn ! 116585_116590
yeah turn right but that's what we were doing when we went right
could we have gotten to the museum without turning ? 132531_135233
no . 135233_135885
no and Kelly remembered that one turn she heard people saying was
were those the only turns we knew about ? 141806_144073
no . 144073_144808
who can tell me xxx +/. 144808_145500
left . 145500_145868
um we knew about left turns Alex what are you thinking we knew
we knew about +/. 149820_151418
+< Nathan . 151418_151993
we knew about one third of turn . 151993_156933
tell me about that . 156933_158413
we had talked about that a little bit . 158413_160978
it's like half of a half . 160978_165798
it's half +//. 165798_167116
okay if you take a half turn and then you divide that half turn in
what do you get when you take a half turn +//. 173171_176106
+< you end up with a fourth . 176106_176107
yeah a quarter turn . 176106_178041
but we had talked about a third of a turn . 178041_180926
if I was gonna use turns of one third Alex how many
if I was gonna turn one third each time how many times
it's kinda hard to think about . 200206_205310
we talked about fourth turns one turning one fourth or
how many quarter turns do I can I go before I've gone a whole
how many times can I turn one fourth in the same direction
well think about that . 228276_231228
which way would you like me to turn Alex right or left ? 231228_233898
I'd like you to turn right . 233898_237568
okay I need just a little bit more room here if I turn to the
left . 249025_250600
this this is my right . 250600_251961
this is my right . 251961_253668
remember I'm gonna use my right not yours . 253855_255900
oh . 255900_256000
+< (be)cause I am the turtle now or I am the turner . 256000_258128
so think about what I should turn to face I'm gonna
turn to the camera . 265503_269473
okay did I make a quarter turn to the right ? 269473_272981
yep how many quarter turns have I turned so far ? 272981_275711
one . 275711_276661
+< one so I'm just going to hold up my first finger . 276661_278713
Alex if I turn another quarter turn where will I be facing or what
chalk+board . 284285_284885
Kelly &~d said the chalk+board . 284885_288000
do you think she's right Alex ? 288000_289210
&=nods . 289210_289800
(o)kay let's let Alex do the next one . 289800_292353
okay so I've gone two fourth turns . 292353_295721
what's another way to say how much I've turned ? 295721_297906
one half . 297906_299023
+< half . 299023_299491
half . 299491_299500
+< one half . 299500_299950
+^ I have turned halfway around so Alex if I turn another quarter
you'll be facing the computer . 307048_310850
good thinking . 310850_312136
I've now turned three fourths of a turn . 312136_315230
xxx . 315230_315501
I think I got I think I got how many turns it needs . 315501_319955
how many quarter turns ? 319955_321173
how many quarter turns does it take to make a whole turn ? 321173_323328
+< I I think four . 323328_325126
yep last quarter turn I'm facing back exactly the way I was before
+< or two halves . 330596_330863
or two halves very good . 330863_332848
+^ two halves or four quarters so how many quarter turns are in
four . 339503_341690
two . 341690_342121
two . 342121_342705
two in a half and four in a whole . 342705_345793
good so can we put that thinking and testing we just did that
or I could have done two half turns . 356716_358935
well, how many turns of one third do you think it would take to
we don't we didn't talk about a third very often . 366891_371225
Alex I'd I'd love to hear your idea . 371225_373611
I think three . 373611_375401
yep (be)cause what a third is three equal parts . 375401_380505
if you divide something into thirds you make three equal parts . 380505_383618
+< oh yeah . 383618_383851
I think I +/. 383851_384150
+< so if I go one third two thirds three thirds I'm all the
which is bigger a third or a fourth ? 387553_391290
thirds . 391290_391906
fourth . 391906_392908
a third even though three is a smaller number than four so how does
because +/. 397361_398228
+< well +/. 398228_398698
+< oh ! 398698_399378
&=gasp . 399378_400146
Vanessa try to explain to me and then I'll let you guys add on to
how should I +/. 403401_406610
+< how should I explain that . 406610_408853
but you don't have to talk about turns but a third of anything . 408853_411810
+^ how come a third is bigger than a fourth when three is a smaller
&=gasp . 417743_419678
+< (be)cause if you wanted to divide something +/. 419678_422495
mmhm did you hear what Vanessa said ? 422495_424251
+^ if you wanted to divide something oh give your hands a rest
+< I'm stretching . 429301_429700
okay . 429700_430150
like pie or something . 430150_431728
+< okay Vanessa wants you to imagine that we're gonna
go ahead . 436755_437800
and um if you wanted if some people if three
she she says imagine that three people each wanted a piece of
then another person wanted some and then they and then they
+< and then another person +/. 468550_468720
okay did you hear Vanessa's explanation ? 468720_471180
+^ she's saying you've got this pie there's three people
well then there's four people and you need to divide the pie into
Alex do you wanna add on to that idea about why thirds
go ahead . 513286_514155
well see since a third will be smaller than a fourth +/. 514155_521228
we just figured out that a third was larger than a fourth or we
we did . 527850_528285
sorry . 528285_529725
that's okay . 529725_530230
+< xxx . 530230_531400
xxx that a third was larger than a fourth . 531400_533383
+< do you think that's true that a third is larger than a fourth ? 533383_536303
yeah . 536303_536705
okay tell me what you think about that . 536705_538271
well since since it's larger a third can use up more of the
mmhm a third would if I if it was just Vanessa and uh
xxx . 560605_561758
+< when would I when would I get the biggest pieces ? 561758_563910
what did I call her ? 563910_564740
Amanda . 564740_565758
Amanda . 565758_566576
