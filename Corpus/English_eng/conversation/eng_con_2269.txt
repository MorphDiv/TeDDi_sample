okay . 0_1440
right, so, paper, um . 1440_3834
paper, yes . 3834_4774
we have to get this paper in by yesterday . 4774_6227
i'm sure we can tell jason what to do about that . 6227_9120
yes, i don't think that's a problem . 9120_10406
anyway, so what's the current status, you were going to send me a
i pointed you at a tex file on tuesday . 14837_18587
okay, so you're supposed to remind me that i was supposed to read
i did . 23017_23957
when i met with you on tuesday . 23957_25672
oh yeah . 25672_28482
okay, so, i haven't read that yet . 28482_30363
um . 30363_31142
well good, because i've been adding to it all day today . 31142_34214
good . 34214_35155
so you didn't notice how little had been done yesterday, for
uh, that's true . 37103_38043
um, well done . 38043_39746
uh, i've got a little over a page, most of the describing the
okay . 47688_48712
how we built a voice in noise, um, and then a little bit about how
okay that sounds good . 55551_57087
so, there's actually a p@l d@l f@l file . 57512_60488
want to briefly show it to me . 60488_62798
yes, if i can manage to get it to load . 62798_66466
it could probably use a little bit of editing, but i have been
uh, it's gonna need more content as well . 72610_76110
oh, obviously, yes . 76110_77301
okay, um, du du du du, i want you to &=sigh, okay, so i'll pick
and have a pass and add stuff . 85410_87641
so the things i'm going to add is uh, why we're doing this in the
though you maybe covered that already . 92923_95321
uh, no, i really didn't cover that too much, although it could
the introduction is probably a better place . 102651_104104
the introduction is probably a good place to do that . 104104_105973
on tuesday you did say you would do that . 105973_107592
yes, i know, i do, i do remember saying that i would, uh, do that .
um, uh . 111508_113989
i'd like a breakdown of number of sentences, number of phones,
uh, there's a similar breakdown in the arctic tech report . 120724_125498
but it's not going to be exactly the same because we didn't use all
and didn't even use all of one set of the arctic . 130040_132321
that's fine, but there still is a set of phones, set of diphones to
and, uh, number of units, things like that . 137703_140001
um, probably a description of the automatic build process that we
um, uh, as with the, um, so we're trying to come up with a name for
and so things like art_ick were coming in, because, uh, Arthur's
so uh, presuming its aesop's fables and cia world factbook . 181044_186676
uh, and so that's, uh, facts and stories, or facts and fables,
and we identify which ones are facts and which ones are fiction, um
and a whole bunch of interesting things I won't say because i'm
you're not supposed to mention that, you're not supposed to
this is supposed to be a natural conversation . 209025_210644
i don't . 210644_211418
i don't, because i'm recorded all the time, um . 211418_213633
well, actually . 213633_216543
&=laughs then you probably are . 216543_221151
yeah, i think i am . 221151_222603
uh, you go to the ISL, you're probably recorded all the
um, right anyway, so we need to have a name for this that we're
did we decide on the name, or did i decide on the name ? 236577_238375
i think you decided on the name and didn't mention it to me . 238375_242043
okay, um, so the name i was working with was swan . 242043_247608
yeah, that's what i was . 247608_248961
what we were using, i think that's okay . 248961_253390
a catchier name might be better . 253390_255188
yeah . 255188_256562
but i'm not good at that . 256562_259896
same here, so let's just . 259896_262194
use swan . 262194_263201
right, okay, so we have that, we're gonna have a u@l r@l l@l, so
it'll be pointed off the let's go page, but that's where it's going
right . 275060_276430
that's the best place to put it . 276430_279502
um . 279502_280859
and there's a bunch of analysis that has to be done, sort of the
i think i have the data for that . 290175_291544
tables will take up space, that's good . 291544_298529
yeah, exactly . 298529_299470
i mean, wait, no, that's not what i'm supposed to say . 299470_302113
ah, i see that you're learning what it is to be a graduate student
that's very important . 305535_306721
i have a nice figure that's just a couple sentences that takes up a
yes, that works too . 313972_316287
but it sets it off so nicely, it fits in perfectly . 316287_319438
so it's an example sentence from the database ? 319438_321390
three example sentences, not from the database but from the
i see . 326177_327118
that's the right thing to do . 327118_328308
a few drunken bagpipes built the sneaky ideas . 328308_332833
yeah, the speech recognizer's never gonna get that . 332833_337096
um, good . 337096_340334
i think that's fine, uh the only problem is, i really like to get
um, so i'd like to have a paper by sunday . 346062_348526
that would be good . 348526_349896
for my own sake i'd like to be well done with this by sunday
no, i agree . 354420_355361
i have other things to do . 355361_356718
that's the problem with having deadline extensions, it's like, they
exactly . 361672_362612
and i really can't afford to do that . 362612_364494
so i am hoping to write more this evening, although i have, have to
the writing i'm less concerned about, it's the content that i'm
so i have to set up the listening tests . 381128_383438
okay, good . 383438_384628
that, i think is the largest worry, is the, the overwhelming
um, yeah, you're not senior enough to do that . 398702_405470
ah, so we'll just put you as the first author then . 405470_406990
i'm not old enough to do that, i haven't retired yet . 406990_410395
um &=laughs uh, yeah . 410395_412276
um, yeah, so as long as those listening tests get done tomorrow,
especially if they get done early enough tomorrow . 423028_426779
um, then i can, then i can get most of the paper written friday . 426779_432827
the problem is that all of our wonderful students don't come in at
so, i'm assuming i am not participating in the listening . 438805_445627
absolutely not . 445627_446418
cause i know too much . 446418_447771
you absolutely can't . 447771_449211
you probably can . 449211_451093
i think i can . 451093_452629
we'll know which one it is, and if i'm weirdly biased, then we will
also, i think being a non native isn't an issue . 457582_461249
probably not, it's general understandability so even if it's, if
i think that's, that, i mean, i'm more tainted from that, but all
and specifically too much festival . 479169_480705
yes, exactly . 480705_482920
um, uh, we'll try everybody else and see what they get . 482920_488040
there will be issues in how to measure the result, we're gonna ask
hmm, right, next is the let's go stuff . 498030_503250
i'm still poking around with that, it's not ready yet . 503250_505793
but that, granted that the paper will be done, or that i won't have
i'm look, i'm trying to get that done saturday . 519105_521665
the absolute latest is saturday . 521665_523547
that's fine, that's fine, i don't think that's gonna be buckets of
yeah, basically, i need to really delve in, i've only scratched the
it's not been encouraging so far, let's say . 538561_543353
so i'm, i'm kinda hoping that i find, i find out that there is
zip and tar g@l z@l ? 565102_568091
um, so actually what i do, i think the other ones i do zip and tar
because i'm assuming that the tar people will have b@l z@l two . 572187_576366
um, and, the other people won't know what it is any, won't know
winzip knows g@l z@l . 582248_583784
yeah, well, that's true . 583784_585832
and it knows tar . 585832_586939
yeah, it knows tar, but it trashes all the files . 586939_589416
well yes . 589416_590440
it puts, uh, control m's into . 590440_591631
sometimes . 591631_593083
okay, only when they're not needed . 593083_595643
um, i told you about there's a thing in festival, with a line in
cause we've, we've been in there too often . 615195_617064
