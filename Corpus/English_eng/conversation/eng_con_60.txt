I guess the story is about a man .
and his friend who he hadn't seen in a long time .
it started when he was walking down the road, .
somewhere about ten o'clock .
and he came across a policeman who was making his rounds .
checking businesses going door to door .
and the policeman stopped him .
and asked him a few questions .
they exchanged pleasantries .
and then the policeman went on his way .
I guess after that he was curious about finding his friend .
it was a place where he had met the policeman .
was a place he had been sometime before in his youth .
and I guess he wanted to come back there to see if somehow his

or the guy was an old friend himself .

I coming to take you to church .
and I said to him that I wasn't feeling very well .
I was sick .
and he said I will see you later .
and as soon as he left to go to church .
I got put on my clothes .
and went outside .
and started flying my kite .
and I was outside for a very long time .
with a couple of friends who lived up the road .
one of my best friends at the time and his name was
and didn't realize how long how much time had passed .
I was probably flying my kite for about two three hours in the
suddenly I felt something hit me on the back of my leg .
and when I turn around there was my dad with my brothers and
and they were all laughing .
and my dad killed the car said +"/.
+" I thought you were sick this morning .
you didn't want to come to church .
and as he said so I just let go of the kite .
and I was just frozen .
I couldn't say a word .
and all of my brothers and sisters started laughing .
and that was pretty much it
