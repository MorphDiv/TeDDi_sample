++ about identical . 0_943
identical does mean exactly the same . 943_3125
ident that's something that that we're sure of . 3125_6838
identical means identical . 6838_8956
they match exactly . 8956_10421
okay . 10421_12110
so you wouldn't be able to tell them apart if two things were
hmm . 16143_18615
so do you think symmetrical and identical for you are kind of the
no &=head:no . 21071_23475
tell me about symmetrical though . 23475_24701
the two things you described for me, the two scarecrows that
they matched exactly . 33438_37136
but you don't think symmetrical is identical ? 37136_39853
what do you think symmetrical is then ? 39853_45073
well +/. 45073_45738
tell me more about your thinking . 45738_46653
I changed my mind now about symmetrical . 46653_51573
to me now symmetrical is like well one part is mostly the
which part would be mostly the same ? 62085_65705
well actually I sort of thought I'll keep my um +... 65705_74561
I'd rather talk about symmetrical xxx . 74561_78028
so two things that would match exactly and be the same . 78028_80860
like the two scarecrows who were dressed the same and had the same
or two quilt designs that were the same design like birds in the
those are things that you would say are symmetrical . 92711_95926
um may I please add one more +/. 95926_98858
certainly . 98858_99558
uhhuh . 99558_100725
well like let's say you have a pattern (o)kay ? 100725_113021
okay just a second . 113021_113755
so is everybody listening ? 113755_114943
if Alex is going to describe a pattern with words we'll have to be
<xxx xxx is playing with his core squares> . 124325_124748
nobody should be touching their core square right now . 124748_125811
you should all have your eyes and ears on Alex . 125811_127238
okay tell us about the pattern you're thinking about Alex . 127238_131373
well I'm thinking about like a pattern of dinosaurs . 131373_133955
okay . 133955_134955
well like let's say the first one was Tyrannosaurus Rex . 134955_141653
mmhm . 141653_142371
the second one's a Dimentrodon . 142371_145041
the third one Cantrosaurus . 145041_148935
mmhm . 148935_149618
and then so on and on and on . 149618_154306
so that would be the part of this pattern that would repeat . 154306_157158
could you say that for them one more time so they'll understand
the three things in order . 161038_161436
okay . 161436_162383
Tyrannosaurus . 162383_164240
Dimentrodon . 164240_165871
and Cantrosaurus . 165871_168665
okay so those are the +//. 168665_170565
those three dinosaurs repeating is the pattern Alex wants us to
how does that pattern help you explain what the word symmetrical
well like you can have a pattern but um just can't have it +... 178698_190395
you can have it some ways that seem difference except that you
are you talking to me about patterning now or about symmetrical ? 201676_207150
I'm talking about both . 207150_210060
okay tell me how that pattern helps explain your thinking about
(be)cause you might be thinking that in your head but so far you
we understand the pattern you are thinking about . 221193_223316
tell us how that helps us think about symmetrical . 223316_226340
um sometimes to me when I hear symmetrical I like repeat something
so you think that <the word> symmetrical has to do with not
something repeats ? 249023_253343
that's an idea Alex wants us to think about . 253343_253841
Vanessa what do you think about symmetrical ? 253841_255836
I think it means like it's there's um uh it's like if you had a a
uhhuh . 266235_267618
and you wanted it to be even in half you would have you would
so I think that it means that you have to measure it . 274275_277773
okay . 277773_278420
this is Vanessa's idea . 278420_280338
she used a quiet voice but she said something very important . 280338_283438
she wants you to think about what if you had a large piece of paper
&=looks:Vanessa . 289208_290770
cut it in half . 290770_291511
cut it in half +... 291511_291735
equally evenly . 291735_293473
evenly . 293473_293698
you would have to measure to find halfway . 293698_299836
or you to to find the middle . 299836_301416
you have to <measure to make sure> they were even ? 301416_303665
<or fold it> . 303665_304703
or fold it ? 304703_305375
could you fold to find the middle of your large piece of paper
mhmm &=nods:yes . 307740_308371
how would I be sure that I had folded down the middle ? 308371_313006
you could xxx put the top corner and the other top corner together
just a sec . 321776_323286
Paul please don't play with your core square right now . 323286_324853
so if I could fold that large piece of paper that's Vanessa's
she said this corner here the top corner and the other top corner
if I could fold them so that they matched evenly would I have
yeah . 341206_341940
okay . 341940_342570
what does that have to do with the idea of symmetrical ? 342570_346316
I think that's true . 346316_348968
did they measure something or find the middle of something in the
yeah . 352606_353210
they put the pin in in the middle of it . 353210_355243
so why was it important to know where the middle of that bedspread
<so that> +... 359776_360423
<so they could> put one house here and the other house there so
so it wouldn't go past the uh middle of the bedspread <so it would
<so it'd be> so it'd be the same . 368776_369788
so it would be the same . 369788_373006
the same length . 373006_373313
the same length ? 373313_373555
so they +/. 373555_374406
well the same <so it would be> +... 374406_375771
<xxx> . 375771_376105
<shh shh shh> . 376105_377705
<that> so that it would be symmetrical . 377705_382911
so it would be symmetrical ? 382911_383888
so somehow putting that pin in the center of that bedspread was
yeah . 388680_390121
um the pin was supposed to be the like can't, is like a line that
okay so the pin was like a line you couldn't go past . 395053_397543
and they wanted to get it symmetrical . 397543_399686
how was knowing where the middle was going to help them make it
is that some is that important to the idea of symmetry ? 405901_409206
this idea of a middle or a place where you could make it even ? 409206_413775
Justin add on <to Vanessa's idea> . 413775_415180
<xxx they each get the> um they put the pin it in so they um
okay so for something to be symmetrical would they need the same
probably . 429118_429971
probably ? 429971_430445
why ? 430445_431073
what are you thinking about symmetrical that tells you they might
well one of them might be a little bit bigger but um they should be
okay so symmetrical maybe has something to do with the same size ? 444778_448785
nobody's used that word before exactly . 448785_452095
nobody's said that the &~sym +//. 452095_454715
does the word symmetrical have something to do with same size ? 454715_457576
um +... 457576_459611
hmm I don't know . 459611_460248
no . 460248_460643
okay what we're going to do +//. 460643_462450
to do some more thinking about that I think we've kind of examined
Brittany . 466260_467260
um I think symmetrical is something two dimensional . 467260_469491
you think symmetrical is something two dimensional ? 469491_471955
&=nods:yes . 471955_472910
so it wouldn't be possible to have a three+d thing a three
if you're talking about symmetrical you'd have to be thinking
yeah because um the story they uh there's uh two dimensional . 482086_488041
what was two dimensional ? 488041_489741
the um their houses . 489741_491411
okay . 491411_493118
they were laying flat . 493118_494176
&~th the houses that they sewed on to the bedspread were two
xxx . 498813_499216
they weren't they weren't three dimensional that you could go
Dani ? 505310_505840
thank you . 505840_507785
um so that's an idea we'll have to explore . 507785_510306
can symmetrical only apply to two dimensional things ? 510306_514743
I dunno . 514743_516206
+^ you're right they didn't talk about three dimensional things in
I think we've exhausted the polla possibilities of thinking
we're going to use um our core squares . 532213_535230
let's see . 535230_539481
<um Brit> um Ashley will you hand me your core square ? 539481_539745
and Alex will you hand me yours ? 539745_544080
thanks . 544080_546185
and Paul will you hand me yours ? 546185_551093
and that's enough for starters . 551093_553096
don't worry we're going to look at all of yours . 553096_553593
but I'm just starting with a few . 553593_556076
okay ? 556076_557231
I'm gonna show you each of their core squares and then
and then I want us to see if that +/. 564095_568065
