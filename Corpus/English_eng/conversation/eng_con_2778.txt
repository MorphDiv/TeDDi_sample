this is the Harry <A> Blackmun Supreme Court Oral History
it's June <six> , <nineteen ninety-five> .
my name is Harold Hongju Koh .
I'm a professor at Yale Law School and a former law clerk to
I'm the interviewer for these sessions .
justice Blackmun , we are talking about <nineteen seventy-three>
we've just finished talking about Roe <v@l> Wade , which
moving now into October term of <nineteen seventy-three> ,
well , of course , I had to dig into my files somewhat , because
my notes indicated it was a Sixth Circuit year .
we had an unusual number of cert petitions that were grants from
it was also the year in which two justices died .
justice Whittaker died November <twenty-six> , <nineteen
I think also it was the year of Kent State , I believe .
justice Douglas was always prominent , I think , during the year .
he took the position throughout the term that the conference room
justice Douglas , also during the year , set a record for time
the record before had been held by Stephen <J> Field , but
then , of course , it was the year of the Nixon case , which I
before we turn to the Nixon case , let me just ask you about
in that case , Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman asked the New York
the Southern District enjoined the bombing , and then that
then there's an attempt to go before Justice Marshall as circuit
he denied the stay , and then they turned to Justice Douglas .
I'm wondering if you can take the story from there .
well , this , of course , involves the basic question of what does
does one justice overrule the ruling of another justice ?
that's always pretty sticky , but it happened here .
justice Douglas , in effect , overruled what Justice Marshall had
but it came back to Justice Marshall , and he did what I think a
of course , we were scattered .
I don't remember exactly where everyone was , but in recess months
he , as I recall , is said to have telephoned everybody for a vote
there's something to be said for that argument , I suppose , but
in fact , were there other occasions where decisions were made by a
well , it seems to me there had been , yes , not many .
one doesn't do it if he can avoid it .
of course , when we're in session , we have a session every week ,
but now and then it has to be done by telephone call .
how did Justice Douglas respond to the full Court , in effect ,
obviously he didn't like it very well , but he had overruled
I should say , Professor Koh , at this point .
I've never known the status of the relationship between Justice
it wasn't very evident from our conferences .
they weren't bosom buddies , so to speak , but they weren't arch
but I say that only from what I gleaned during conferences and not
I never heard anything spoken derogatorily by one of the other .
did anybody have anything approaching a close relationship with
I suppose the answer to that is in the negative .
I thought when I came to the Court , or before I came to the Court
there was no antagonism between them , but it wasn't a close social
I think I mistakenly got the idea because I believe the two
I suppose we see too much of each other during the day to want to
did the other justices resent Justice Douglas's habit of taking off
well , there was some mild criticism about it .
I don't know whether they resented it , but it did make for an
there he was out there , and he didn't have and I think he
to reach him by phone , one had to go to a phone to which he had to
this didn't help his departure , his early departures , and , of
he'd say in mid-May , +"/.
+" my work is done , and the rest of you guys , you're kind of slow
+" no reason why I should stick around .
+" I'm going out to Goose Prairie where I'm happier than I am here
did you ever see his place in Goose Prairie ?
I was never there .
I came close to being there one time , but I never did .
I believe Justice Rehnquist visited Goose Prairie , but you'll have
justice Douglas also did many extra judicial writings .
he wrote a number of books while he was on the Court , Did he ever
no .
he wrote a lot , of course , but he never made a big thing out of
he didn't pass it around .
he didn't send complimentary copies to all of us .
I think he went about his own business and felt that was his own
he could do it if he wanted to , as long as he wasn't neglecting
this is , I guess , a delicate question .
it was well known that he had a very complicated personal life ,
did that ever enter into your dealings with him or into his
on the latter , it probably entered into consideration of other
so far as I personally was concerned , because I got to know
he must have been a person who was not easy to live with , I would
I was going to say being red-headed ; I don't want to insult my
but he was a person who could flame up in anger at times very
was he a charming man ?
what , was his best side ?
you hear a lot about his fits of anger and pique , but nobody talks
he had a lot of good humor , and , of course , all one had to do to
there was a period I don't want to repeat myself .
I hope I haven't said this in these conversations you and I have
this was at the time When the Court had one automobile , and the
justice Douglas reserved it every morning at eight o'clock for ten
but anyway , there was a period when my automobile was broken down
the driver would pick me up and then we'd go and get Justice
I've always felt that was a big plus in my relationships with him ,
we talked about a lot of things .
as I say , if the conversation got a little stiff , all I had to
he was a complicated person that would be difficult for a lot of
did you talk about cases in these rides or was it always about
we didn't talk about cases that were under consideration at all .
we talked about legal philosophy , mainly , and his experience as a
let me ask you about his feelings about various personalities .
what did he think of Richard Nixon ?
well , he didn't think very much of Richard Nixon , and one could
there were certain things on the wall that were derogatory of
cartoons ?
yes , and other things .
what about Gerald Ford ?
Gerald Ford had had a longstanding campaign to impeach Douglas .
did Douglas ever talk about that ?
no , not specifically .
of course , for a while Gerald Ford was really carrying the torch
I have always felt that this was a good reason why Douglas did not
but it all worked out .
how did Justice Douglas get along with Chief Justice Burger ?
oh , I think they got along .
they certainly were not close friends .
they were ideologically very different , of course .
their temperaments , I suppose their abilities , their backgrounds
but Chief Justice Burger , largely as chief justice , I think ,
but so far as legal issues were concerned , there was antagonism ,
again I hope I'm not repeating , but I well remember one case where
+" for these reasons , my vote is to affirm .
+" bill , what do you think about it ?
+, bill Douglas being the senior sat at the other end of the table
Douglas's response was only this : +"/.
+" chief Justice , for the reasons you have spelled out at such
period .
that was his contribution .
well , one sensed , of course , a little antagonism between the two
the Cambodia bombing case that I just mentioned was just one of the
another event which that triggered , of course , was the burglary
in September of <nineteen seventy-two> , the grand jury
by February of <nineteen seventy-three> , which was only a
then by May of <nineteen seventy-three> , Archibald Cox
do you have a memory of this period ?
when did , you start to take all this seriously ?
it was dismissed initially by Nixon as a third-rate burglary , but
I'm not sure I know exactly how to answer that question , and what
I do not speak for any other member of the Court as to his reaction
but it seemed to me that all through those events that you mention
they were happening , but there's always something happening at the
I know all of a sudden , the significance of the incidents put
I guess maybe I was slow at the time , but I hadn't realized what
do you remember watching the Senate testimony of John Dean or the
yes , I do specifically remember the John Dean testimony , and
yes .
did you have any prior contact with Elliot Richardson , who was
no , not really .
I may well have met him up at some doings in the First Circuit or
how about Archibald Cox , whom he appointed as special prosecutor ?
well , Archie Cox , of course , was a well-known figure ,
so in that sense , I had a touch of Archibald Cox and knew who he
did you have a high regard for him ?
yes , indeed , I did .
another player in the drama was , Judge John Sirica of the <U_S>
district Court for the District of Columbia .
did you have any particular experience with him ?
well , I didn't know judge Sirica except as one of many judges in
I don't recall that the Court ever was particularly critical of the
I don't remember the Court's being critical of him as such , that
just took it and the appeals were there , and we went on .
, Cox was the very first special prosecutor .
over time , Congress passed a statute creating independent counsels
ultimately in a case called Morrison <v@l> Olson , you voted
what is your feeling about independent counsels and whether they're
you're not asking whether I think my vote in that case was correct
obviously I must say that I think it was correct .
but I think it's one of those situations where an independent
the danger , of course , is that one tends maybe to overuse it ,
in the fall of <nineteen seventy-three> , shortly after
this is recorded as having occurred during the baseball World
according to The Brethren , Justice Stewart was given a note by his
+" agnew resigns .
+" kranepool flies out .
or something of this nature .
did you have any exposure to Agnew or any view about him ?
I didn't have any particular feel about him .
I'm sure I met him at some of these state functions and this kind
you mention the notes .
potter Stewart , of course , as I was , was a baseball fan and a
during the times when they were in the World Series , which was in
well , they brought it to whomever was sitting at the end of the
I think this irritated Chief Justice Burger a little bit , because
but one had , to keep up with the important events of the day ,
<mister> Justice , let me take you through the day-to-day
in late summer of <nineteen seventy-three> , Judge Sirica
this went to the <D_C> Circuit , which affirmed Judge
this was in October of <nineteen seventy-three> .
many people expected that the case would then come to your Court .
instead , President Nixon compromised and offered summaries of the
then Nixon ordered Archibald Cox not to demand any more tapes .
do you remember at this point having any feeling about whether the
there was a close call there .
I think it was a close call .
I personally thought it would come before the Court .
I didn't attempt to find out the feeling of other justices at all ,
of course , one thing that I think people sometimes forget is the
exciting days , in retrospect , anyway .
the next event , October <twenty> , <nineteen seventy-three>
on that day , President Nixon instructed his senior White House
first Richardson refused and resigned , and then his deputy , Bill
do you remember that event and your reaction to it ?
I certainly remember the event and remember watching it on
what was your feeling about Bork , who had been solicitor general
first of all , I was surprised to learn the exact order of
of course , solicitor general is number three , actually .
I was a little surprised that he didn't go the way of the two
but I didn't know General Bork well , and I'm not being critical of
I just thought it would go the other way .
what kind of solicitor general was Bork ?
I think he was a very presentable solicitor general .
he was distinctly different from Dean Griswold and from Archie Cox
he was Robert Bork , and his manner of presenting a case was
I personally liked the other methods rather than his , but that was
he always presented his cases adequately , with articulation , with
subsequently he was appointed to the <D_C> Circuit and
he went through that tumultuous confirmation hearing , and then was
what were your feelings about him during that period ?
it must have been a very difficult time for him .
I suppose he remained a bitter person after that , as anyone else
and yet in my own case , I look at Clement Haynsworth , who , when
I always admired Judge Haynsworth for that .
did you ever have much of a one-on-one dealing with Robert Bork ?
no , I would say not .
I'll leave it at that .
after be was not confirmed , he argued a number of cases at the
do you remember any of those arguments or any general reaction to
they were well performed , they were well argued , and I always
tough , tough to go through an experience of that kind .
when you saw the confirmation troubles that he had , did it seem to
oh , I was in no position to judge that .
I would lean toward the sympathetic side , I suppose , having gone
the replacement to Archibald Cox was Leon Jaworski of the firm of
did you know him at all , or did you have any contact with him ?
not any close contact .
I knew him and had met him as president of the American Bar , knew
he was an able person .
at this point , in October of <nineteen seventy-three> ,
the White House said that some of them didn't exist and also said
do you have any view as to where that gap might have come from ?
no .
if I did , it would be pure speculation , just as it is with
who believes what ?
I do not know .
by March of <nineteen seventy-four> , Jaworski had sought
jaworski subpoenaed sixty-four more tapes .
what later came to light was that in that indictment , Richard
once again , Jaworski requested the transcripts , this time with a
at this point , the special prosecutor , Mister Jaworski
you were one of the justices who voted against cert before judgment
do you remember what your reasoning was in doing this ?
I don't remember specifically what my reasoning was .
as I recall , cert was granted , and cert before judgment is most
there are two : this and the Iranian hostage case was the other
I suppose my leaning as a former appellate court judge was to let
but I didn't feel too strongly about it , even though <one>
it takes a real case to get cert before judgment , but this was
I should mention that a number of commentators who later agreed
at this point , the question arose of whether Justice Rehnquist
do you remember any of the discussions about that ?
yes .
there weren't too many discussions .
certainly the Court wasn't passing in judgment on Justice Rehnquist
the routine at the Court is that a recusal is a matter of personal
I think he was uncomfortable through this period and eventually did
do you think he and Mitchell were close friends ?
well , I think there was a period probably when they were certainly
so thereafter , Justice Rehnquist didn't participate at all in the
that's correct .
did Justice Rehnquist have a relationship with Kleindienst , the
I can't answer that question ; I don't know of any such .
was it possible that Rehnquist could have been subpoenaed during
, oh , anything's possible by way of subpoena , sure , of course .
at this point we're now in May of <nineteen seventy-four>
this is long after oral arguments are usually granted , and that
do you remember your feeling about the rest of the term's Work and
well , we were all rather disturbed about it , because usually the
so that each of us had his share of backlog opinions that were not
I think , by and large , we devoted our initial efforts , I think ,
during this period , the Court got an unusual letter from the then
do you remember the letter and what it was all about ?
in general terms .
I remember the majority leader's seeming antagonism toward the
I don't know the basis of it , because it goes back , really ,
I think he thought it was a nuisance and got in the way and was
the letter basically asks you to give up your vacation to hear the
I guess the justices didn't take too kindly to this .
no .
they didn't like to have it called “vacation” , I suppose , because
oral argument was then set for July <eighth> , after the
according to various accounts of the case , a number of the
was this an unusual step ?
I would say it was a little unusual .
I well remember the setting .
the eighth day of July happens to be the birthday of our oldest
but I don't particularly remember those pre-argument memos ,
we don't do it much anymore .
do you think various justices were angling to be assigned the
oh , I would have to say no to that , I think .
it wouldn't be a very enviable assignment , because whoever caught
in the files in the case , it shows that in late June , the Court
at this time , do you think there was any serious thought about
well , the chief justice was very much opposed to any cameras in
knowing the chief as you did , do you think he was in an awkward
among the justices , was he the one who was closest with the White
who ?
chief Justice Burger .
I think probably what you've just said is true , that among the
there's been some suggestion in at least two historical accounts
does that ring true to you ?
I know nothing about that , really , and I don't want to say that
I just don't know .
starting on July <eighth> , oral argument was held for
Leon Jaworski appeared for the special prosecutor and also Phil
what are your memories of that oral argument ?
well , it's rather dim in my memory , but I certainly was not
I think the Court was annoyed that it had to sit for three hours on
but the work was there , and it had to be done .
we went at it .
did you have any feeling about Jim <Saint> Clair , the
well , it was the first time I had seen him in action , and as far
he's admitted to the bar and is , I take it , an active lawyer in
I had not known him .
these are sensational , sensitive cases that make it difficult for
did you have doubts as to whether the president would comply if the
I just assumed that he would comply , I think .
so I guess the answer to that is , no , I did not have any doubts .
but one never knows .
the chronology of the evolution of the opinion is recounted in
my comparison of the files with The Brethren report suggests that
at least one commentator , or probably two commentators , John
do you have any feeling about how this information about the case
well , I know I was surprised at the detail set forth in the book ,
I personally don't think it's a very good book , but it's an
it has a lot of detail , it has a lot of misstatements of fact
I remember our youngest daughter , who was then abroad , corning
the book was on our coffee table , and she picked it up and took it
+" daddy , I've read this with interest .
+" for the first time in my life , by reading it , I'm beginning to
and I think if that book did that for her , it would do it for
but maybe there should have been another book written by somebody
but there it is , and there's a lot of stuff in it , some of which
, why do you think Justice Stewart would talk to the press ?
I suppose one would have had to ask Justice Stewart .
I think the so-called leaks , such as they were , I always felt
but Potter was always friendly with the press , he liked the press
it was a matter , I think , of great concern to Chief Justice
one of the themes of The Brethren is the rivalry between Justice
was that real or is that something that was just manufactured for
was the feeling between the two of them real ?
well , I don't know how to answer that question , Professor Koh ,
he knew there were leaks , he knew there were substantial leaks ,
at the first conference following the argument in the Nixon tapes
I think there was a feeling of unanimity in that whatever was done
were people conscious of the looming impeachment proceedings in the
I would give you an affirmative answer on that , yes .
and did it come as a surprise to you that the chief justice decided
no , not really .
I think almost any chief justice would have given it to himself .
after all , the chief supposedly is first among equals , and it was
I think there were one or two others who would like to have had it
I think Potter Stewart would like to have had it .
Douglas , I don't know , maybe so .
but it didn't surprise me at all that it went to the chief .
at this point , ironically , Chief Justice Warren passed away .
yes .
do you remember that event and how it interacted with the tapes
well , it certainly interacted with it .
I remember Chief Justice Burger telephoning me , and I must assume
and I said , “Who's gone” ?
and then he , of course , said it was Earl Warren .
I think the passing of Chief Justice Warren made a great impression
this happened right in the midst of all this other thing , and it
do you think that the Court was inspired by the example of Chief
it might have been .
I don't want to say it was or was not , but it certainly might have
what kind of relationship did you have with Chief Justice Warren ?
did you have any dealings with him ?
well , nothing very close , but he was always nice to me , and I
I certainly respected him and I hoped that in passage of time , he
did he have a special closeness with any of the other justices ?
did I have a special what ?
did Earl Warren was he especially close to any of the other
I wouldn't want to say that he was , because I don't believe
I thought there was an element of special closeness between Justice
what kind of relationship did Chief Justice Burger have with Chief
did they have any kind of relationship ?
I think they were friendly , and I'm sure that Chief Justice Burger
the last question before we change the tape .
at Chief Justice Warren's funeral , President Nixon , who was the
do you remember anything about that ?
was there an awkward social moment where the justices of the Court
oh , I wouldn't say so , that it was an awkward social moment .
it was Earl Warren's funeral , and I think that fact dominated the
we'll change tapes now , but when we come back , I want to talk
