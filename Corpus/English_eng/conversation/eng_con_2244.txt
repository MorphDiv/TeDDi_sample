so it's probably not on . 200127_200343
that's at the Cinema Saver; that's too bad . 200343_202277
I guess we could call 'em to make sure . 202277_204986
or we could call the Video King . 204986_207812
+" a meaty love story full of odd, well deve well developed
too bad ! 212414_213197
call Video King for what purpose ? 213197_215257

yeah, I'm about to decide, too, that um, Hollywood Video has more
it's true . 224784_225367
I just figure Video King is the smaller chain . 225367_228376
hhh . 228376_229469
but it's true; Hollywood Video probably does have more choices . 229469_231669
d'you have a Hollywood Video card ? 231669_233412
mhmm . 233412_233895

yeah . 237804_238464

that may be more fun, sitting around here, than going to a movie
I think so . 242590_243190
I think so . 243190_243766
yeah; we could see this The Man Who Wasn't There . 243766_245416

hmm, pretty neat movie . 349764_352524
