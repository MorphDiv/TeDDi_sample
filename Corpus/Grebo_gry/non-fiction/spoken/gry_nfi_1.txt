# special_characters:	Citing from Innes (1966), p. 11: "About the representation of the majority of Grebo sounds there is no problem, and all writers are in agreement. There is, on the other hand, a marked lack of agreement about the representation of the following: I. the velar nasal, 2. the labio-velar nasal, 3. the nasal semi-vowel, 4. the three palatals, 5. the three E-vowels, 6. the three O-vowels. On all these controversial points the spelling in this book follows Auer, with only minor modifications, which are set out in the following list: 1. ŋ, 2. ŋm, 3. ŋw, 4. ky,gy,ny, 5. e,ė,ɛ, 6. o,ȯ,ɔ."

<comment_1>	This is the title of the paragraph .
<comment_2>	dɔ wudi : ‘ mother-in-law money ’ . A suitor gives his prospective mother-in-law 12/- for her own use . This is quite distinct from the bridewealth , which is paid later and in cattle . In the event of a subsequent divorce , the bridewealth must be repaid , but the 12/- is regarded as a personal gift , and is not returned .

<line_76>	Kɔdɛ timɛ yu a gbėbė a ŋwi bidė nɔ kwa , ɔ bi tidė yidi . Dɛ nɛ no nɛɛ ɔ midė

The 3rd pl . object pronoun ne which occurs here is not to be confused with the particle ne which commonly occurs with the indicative mood ; this latter is impossible here since it does not occur in a sentence in which an emphatic pronoun is in subject position .
<comment_2>	koɛo ... ɔ sõɛ̃ ɔ yi a taa : ‘ on account of her daughter's hardship she has seen ’ . The first ɔ is a 3rd sg . possessive pronoun referring to the daughter , the second is a 3rd sg . subject pronoun referring to the mother . The 12/- present is given by the young man as some compensation to his mother-in-law for the trouble she has had in bringing up her daughter . sõɛ̃ : verbal noun from sõã ‘ suffer ’ .

<comment_1>	This is the title of the paragraph .
<comment_2>	kadė , kabuȯ : lit . ‘ house mother , house father ’ . These two compounds have as their first IC ka , which occurs only in compounds ; elsewhere kae ‘ house ’ occurs . A few other words have a special compounding form , e . g . to ‘ war ’ , which has the compounding form ta . It should be noticed that in phrases like kadė kɔ kabuȯ hẽ the expression denoting the female comes first , in contrast with the usual English order ‘ husband and wife ’ . Compare also nyenɛ kɔ nyebeɔ hẽ ‘ wife and husband ’ in line 92 .

<comment_1>	bɛ kpa ti kpodade : lit . ‘ if it carries some time ’ , i . e . ‘ when some time has elapsed , after some time ’ .
<comment_2>	kɛ pudȯ wudi : ‘ bridewealth ’ . Bridewealth is paid after a trial period of marriage , when the girl's parents are satisfied that the marriage is likely to last . Unlike the amount given to the girl's mother , which is fixed at 12/- ( though a suitor may give more if he wishes ) , the amount of bridewealth is not fixed , and may range from two cows upwards . It is paid in cattle , and these are kept by the girl's clan and bred to provide cattle with which to repay the bridewealth in the event of divorce , and also to provide bridewealth for the young men of the clan who wish to marry .
