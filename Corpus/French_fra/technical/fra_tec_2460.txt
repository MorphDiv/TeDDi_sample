Epilogue
She had her moments, she had some style, the best show in town was the crowd, outside the Casa Rosada crying 'Eva Peron'; but that's all gone now...

We still need people!
KDE is a huge project, and every KDE supporter has already realized that.
All of us are trying very hard to create a user interface that is easy to use and maybe also has the potential to make UNIX ready for the desktop PC.
You have the chance to participate in this project too, and we would be thankful if you did.
Developers and interested users communicate via several mailing lists described in.
If you would like to help, please do so!
We are still looking for helpers in the following departments:
Development (Libraries and Applications)
Documentation
Graphics
Beta-Testing
and everywhere else, too :-)
