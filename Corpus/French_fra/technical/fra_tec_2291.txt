Setting the Properties for a Frame/Formatting Frames
For each frame in your document, you can:
Determine how KWord handles full text frames
Determine how text wraps around or through overlapping frames
Determine the frames exact size
Establish margins within a frame.
All of these settings can be determined in the Frame Properties dialog box.
In order to adjust the properties of any frame, you must first select the frame you want to change.
Simply click once on the frame border of the frame you want to edit.
You can now edit the properties one of two ways:
Place the mouse pointer on the border of the frame, and click once with the right mouse button.
A small menu will appear.
Select Frame/Frameset.
The Properties dialog consists of one dialog box, with four index tabs labeled Options, Text Run Around, Connect Text Frames and Geometry.
It is a common situation.
You define a frame, and begin to type.
There is too much text to fit within the current bounds of the frame.
KWord has three solutions to this problem.
Using this dialog, you can determine which method it uses.
If you choose Create automatically a new frame, whenever a frame set becomes full, KWord automatically creates a new page.
On this new page, it creates a new frame, of the same size and position.
It also sets the frame so that your text automatically flows into the new frame
If you choose Resize automatically last frame, whenever a frame set becomes full, KWord automatically extends the bottom border of the text frame to accommodate the new text.
It will continue to expand as new text is added.
The third solution is not really a solution at all.
If you select Don't show the extra text, KWord does not create a new frame or change the current frame in any way.
You will need to manually resize the current frame, or add a new frame to the frame set.
Remember these options only apply to a full frame set.
If there is already another window for text to flow into, the text will flow into the next frame in the frame set as you have previously determined.
To adjust how text flows around overlapping frames, click the tab labeled Text Run Around.
When you overlay two text frames, and text from both frames is competing for the same space on the page, KWord can (at your option), make sure that text from two frames does not overlap.
As you can see from the options in the dialog box, there are three possible choices.
Run through this frames
By selecting this option, you are telling KWord to ignore all other frames when it displays the text in this frame.
Run around the bounding rectangle of other frames
By selecting this option, you are telling KWord to wrap the text of this frame around other overlapping frames.
Don't run around this frames
By selecting this option, you are telling KWord to not wrap any text around the edges of other frames, but instead, to skip down below the other frames before continuing to display text in this frame.
You can also determine how close your frames appear by setting the Runaround Gap in the text-box provided.
Increasing the size of the runaround gap will create a white border between the text in the two text frames.
You can adjust the size, position and margins of your frame by clicking on the tab labeled Geometry
This dialog box allows you to specify exactly where the frame goes and how large it is.
You can locate your frame on the page by first entering the top and left measurements.
This determines where the top left corner of the frame will be.
All measurements are from the top left corner of the page.
You can also determine the exact size of the frame by entering its height and width in the text boxes provided.
These two measurements are relative to the top left corner of the frame you specified above.
You can also use this dialog box to specify margins for your frame.
The margins of the frame are similar to margins on a page.
By entering a margin into the text boxes, you can have KWord automatically set aside a border of white space around the text in this frame.
This will ensure that the text will not be located too closely to other frames or margins.
It is important to understand the difference between setting the margins here, and setting the Runaround Gap (see above).
KWord only applies the Runaround Gap when two frames overlap.
If two frames are placed right next to each other, the runaround gap does not affect the final output.
When you set a margin for a frame, however, the white space is set aside regardless of what other frames may be overlapping.
