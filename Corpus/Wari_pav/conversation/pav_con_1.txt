# comments:	In the original text in Everett and Kern (1997), for each sentence there is a transcription of Wari' speech into a Latin script, a segmentation into grammatically relevant morphemes (though only for some words where this is needed), a glossing, and a translation into English. These are given here as: <line_x>, <segmentation>, <glossing>, and <translation> respectively. Note that the segmentations are often empty (indicated by underscore <_>), meaning that the word in the Latin script is equivalent to the segmentation.
