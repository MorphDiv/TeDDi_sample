# comments:		Terrill (1999), p. 441 gives the following explanations about punctuation conventions: "Punctuation conventions are as follows. A numbered chunk of text is an intonation group plus extra-prosodic afterthoughts which are syntactically and/or semantically linked. Full-stops indicate sentence-final intonation. Commas represent a pause after a rise in pitch. Slashes represent a pause after level pitch. Exclamation marks indicate prosodically prominent elements inserted into the intonation contour. Question marks indicate question intonation. Double quotes indicate direct speech, which may be pronounced in a different voice than the rest of the text."
