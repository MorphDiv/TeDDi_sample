# special_characters:	Equal signs <=> indicate clitic breaks, and <-> morpheme breaks. These are also used in the original script used to write the Paiwan sentences (not only in glosses). <ʔ> represents a voiceless glottal stop. The less-than sign <<>, and the more-than sign <>> are used to mark infixes, e.g. k<em>an "eat", where <em> is an infix. For the mapping between orthographic representations and Paiwan sounds see Chang (2006), p. 30.
# short_description:	Paiwan legend called "tjuvak", i.e. "sea shells". This is an oral story told by a Paiwan speaker called ʔLuay in the dialect of Sai (Chang, 2006, p. 428-430).
