# short_description:	Citing Craig (1986, p. 22): "The text presented here is the first Rama text to be published. It was recorded in July 1985 in Nicaragua by Nora Rigby, a 63 year old speaker of Rama who resides presently in Rama Cay but who has spent most of her life among the Ramas of the mainland, in Wiring Cay, Monkey Point and Cane Creek. The text is in the narrative genre and tells of the traditional hunting of the manatee. It is presented by numbered sentences with both a word by word and free translation."
