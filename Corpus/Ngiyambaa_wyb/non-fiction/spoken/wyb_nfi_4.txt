# short_description:	The title in English of this song is: "Moolbong Johnson (Wiradjuri): Changing ways." Donaldson (1977). p. 397 makes the following remarks about the song: "Jack Johnson was known as Moolbong from his association with Moolbong Station. He was a much revered and feared wiriŋan or 'clever man'. He was a Wiradjuri man, but composed a number of Ngiyamba: songs which are still remembered. He is mentioned by Berndt (1947:329)."

# comments:	Donaldson (1977), p. 393 makes the following comments about the songs given in her Appendix: "About fifteen songs and song fragments have been recorded. Only one of them was appreciably longer than the songs presented here. It concerns a station-owner's child who was lost in the hills, how he survived, was discovered and restored to his distraught parents, It proved impossible to establish a reliable enough text to include it here. The language of the songs, in so far as they are remembered, does not differ in any way from the language of ordinary speech, except that linefinal syllables are stressed. (No word-final syllable is stressed in ordinary speech, unless it contains a long vowel.) All the surviving songs were composed by men a generation older than the informants who contributed to this study. Sarah Johnson sang and elucidated all those presented here. The composer's name is given for each, together with a mnemonic title in English. Waŋa:ybuwan people however never give the songs titles, referring to them as "the song about such-and-such", or "poor old so-and-so's song"." About the glossing: it should be noted that "when the same morphemes in the same sequence in adjecent sentences, morpheme-by-morpheme glosses are omitted in all but the first sentence, [...]" (Donaldson, 1977, p. 361). The original text gives morpheme segmentations with enclitic pronouns marked by <=>, and other morpheme boundaries marked by <-> (in the glosses there are additionally <+> signs marking the linking of morphemes for which boundaries cannot be marked by a hyphen). The segmentations are given in <segmentation>. The </> signs mark pauses in the recording. The orthography in <line_x> is derived by us by just removing the segmentation marks.
