# comments:	Donaldson (1977), p. 361 makes the following comments about the texts given in her Appendix: "The reader should be cautious in drawing conclusions about the structuring of Ngiyamba: discourse from any of the texts, and particularly from Text 1, to which two speakers contributed. Each text represents a conscious effort to tell a story in Ngiyamba:, which has been almost wholly supplanted by English in the everyday lives of the narrators. There was often considerable discussion in English both before and during the telling, while narrators worked out what to say, listened to the recording of what they had said so far, and suchlike." About the glossing: it should be noted that "when the same morphemes in the same sequence in adjecent sentences, morpheme-by-morpheme glosses are omitted in all but the first sentence, [...]" (Donaldson, 1977, p. 361). The original text gives morpheme segmentations with enclitic pronouns marked by <=>, and other morpheme boundaries marked by <-> (in the glosses there are additionally <+> signs marking the linking of morphemes for which boundaries cannot be marked by a hyphen). The segmentations are given in <segmentation>. The </> signs mark pauses in the recording. The orthography in <line_x> is derived by us by just removing the segmentation marks.
