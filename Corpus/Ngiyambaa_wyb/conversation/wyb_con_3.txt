# short_description:	The title in English of this story is: "Eliza Kennedy (Keewong): wa:way, river-maker." Donaldson (1977), p. 373 makes the following remarks about the text: "This text and the following one concern wa:way, called 'rainbowserpent' in the anthropological literature (Radcliffe-Brown 1930), Ngiyamba: speakers never translate the word. They liken a wa:way to a big snake, and to the whale which swallowed Jonah. No connection is made, nowadays at least, between wa:way and the rainbow, although the rainbow has some remembered cultural significance. (You must not point at the rainbow lest your mother's mother die.) Though this story refers to a single wa:way, it is generally thought that a number of them shared in creating the rivers. When wa:way came up in conversation on another occasion, somebody said: ŋilu-gala:-baɽa babir dhiŋgaŋ-gu ba:wan miyi	that+ERG-PL+EST-CATEG ASSERT big creature-ERG Darling+ABS make+PAST - and went on to list other rivers, then explained, "Them big animals made all the rivers." Several encounters with wa:way are claimed to have taken place within living memory. In one, a man was swallowed together with a bag of groceries. He tickled its stomach and was spewed up again, but lost the groceries. He was discovered prostrate, with shreds of his purchases scattered about. In another, two men approached a wa:way hole which was steaming and bubbling fiercely. One of them was of Ba:gandji descent. He pacified the wa:way by addressing it with a few words of Ba:gandji. The hill which thwarted wa:way's progress in this story is Mount Manara. Eliza Kennedy heard the story in her childhood from Ellen Bourke, who was a nhi:lyigiyalu from the area around Marfield station. Ellen Bourke spoke Ba:gandji as well as Ngiyamba:. Ba:gandji people associated Mount Manara with ŋadji (the Ba:gandji equivalent of wa:way)."

# comments:	Donaldson (1977), p. 361 makes the following comments about the texts given in her Appendix: "The reader should be cautious in drawing conclusions about the structuring of Ngiyamba: discourse from any of the texts, and particularly from Text 1, to which two speakers contributed. Each text represents a conscious effort to tell a story in Ngiyamba:, which has been almost wholly supplanted by English in the everyday lives of the narrators. There was often considerable discussion in English both before and during the telling, while narrators worked out what to say, listened to the recording of what they had said so far, and suchlike." About the glossing: it should be noted that "when the same morphemes in the same sequence in adjecent sentences, morpheme-by-morpheme glosses are omitted in all but the first sentence, [...]" (Donaldson, 1977, p. 361). The original text gives morpheme segmentations with enclitic pronouns marked by <=>, and other morpheme boundaries marked by <-> (in the glosses there are additionally <+> signs marking the linking of morphemes for which boundaries cannot be marked by a hyphen). The segmentations are given in <segmentation>. The </> signs mark pauses in the recording. The orthography in <line_x> is derived by us by just removing the segmentation marks.
