# short_description:	The title in English of this story is: "Lily Hampton and Eliza Kennedy (Keewong): The burba (initiation ceremonies)". Donaldson (1977), p. 361 makes the following remarks about the text: "The narrators recall memories of the last burba which took place in Waga:ybuwan country, at giranhanga (West McDonalds Tank) in 1912. Speakers who contriouted texts or recorded songs were in their teens at that time, [...]"

# comments:	Donaldson (1977), p. 361 makes the following comments about the texts given in her Appendix: "The reader should be cautious in drawing conclusions about the structuring of Ngiyamba: discourse from any of the texts, and particularly from Text 1, to which two speakers contributed. Each text represents a conscious effort to tell a story in Ngiyamba:, which has been almost wholly supplanted by English in the everyday lives of the narrators. There was often considerable discussion in English both before and during the telling, while narrators worked out what to say, listened to the recording of what they had said so far, and suchlike." About the glossing: it should be noted that "when the same morphemes in the same sequence in adjecent sentences, morpheme-by-morpheme glosses are omitted in all but the first sentence, [...]" (Donaldson, 1977, p. 361). The original text gives morpheme segmentations with enclitic pronouns marked by <=>, and other morpheme boundaries marked by <-> (in the glosses there are additionally <+> signs marking the linking of morphemes for which boundaries cannot be marked by a hyphen). The segmentations are given in <segmentation>. The </> signs mark pauses in the recording. The orthography in <line_x> is derived by us by just removing the segmentation marks.

<translation>	The little bubu scattered the sugar and tea .
<footnote_4>	The mother of one of the women then in their teens had provocatively boasted of killing a bat . In the mythology , the bat was responsible for making men's genitals . bubu punished this transgression by scattering her provisions although " it was starving times " , dhiyal , ' owlet nightjar ' was responsible for making women's genitals , and the women would be likewise angered if a man harmed a nightjar . But no powers intervened in their interests , as bubu did for the men . Mathews mentions similar disciplinary destruction taking place in initiation ceremonies he witnessed , including those of the neighbouring Wiradjuri ( Mathews 1897 : 133 ) . Two late nineteenth century Wembawemba songs , an admiring song about the bat and a derogatory one about the owlet nightjar , reflect the same tradition ( Hercus 1969 : 91 - 3 ) . The tradition appears to have been general among the " Kulin " people to the south west of the Waŋa:ybuwan and Wiradjuri as well as widespread in New South Wales . Hercus ( loc . cit. ) cites its mention by Howitt , who speaks of the " sex totems " of the Wotjo nation , i . e . the N . W . Kulin people ( Howitt 1904 : 144 - 5 ) .
