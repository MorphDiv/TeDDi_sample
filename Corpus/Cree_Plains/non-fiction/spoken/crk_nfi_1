<footnote_1> Unfortunately I did not record the gesture .
<footnote_2> Probably kīh-utinamwak .
<translation> The people of old were in a piteous state , when first they lived here on earth . The Higher Powers had put them down here with nothing at all . They went naked . They had no clothes , no knives . All they had for a knife was a bone . From the beginning they had no fire . With merely an arrow they killed animals , fastening bones to their arrows . They had nothing ; they were in a piteous state . Presently they made fire for themselves , doing it like this ; when it was hot , they got fire from it . Also they pounded a stone , and when it sent out sparks , from this , too , the people got fire . Their pots and kettles were of earth . Also , they would dig a hole and put in a hide , and heat some stones ; in this way they cooked meat . Then in time they began to have beaver-pelts for their clothes .

<paragraph_2> kītahtawä päyak kīh-pawātam ä-wīh-kapayit mōniyāw-iyiniwa wāpiski-wiyāsah . ātsimōw tāyispīhk ta-kapāyit . tāpwä ānwäh-tawāw ; ātiht tāpwähtāk . äkwah äkutä māmihk ispitsiwak , tsīkih kihtsikamihk . 
<translation> Then at one time a certain man dreamt that the Canadian , the White Man , would land here . He told when they would land . Truly , he was not given credence ; only some believed him . Then moved their camp out there to the east , close to the great sea .

<paragraph_3> " äkwah wīpats kā-wīh-pä-kapātsik ! " itwäw ; " māskōts ahpōh mituni kiyipah , " itäw ayīsiyiniwah . 
<translation> " Now the time is close at hand when they will land ! " he said ; " Surely very soon , " he told the people .

<paragraph_4> tahtuh kīkisäpā ntaw-ay-itāpiw māna nipīhk . kītahtawä kā-pätsāpahtahk tsīmānah . 
<translation> Every morning he would go and look out upon the water . Then at one time he saw boats coming .

<paragraph_5> ōtah äh-pä-takuhtäyit , sakitsihtsänitōwak ; atamiskutātōwak . tsikämā äkusi nistam kā-isih-wāpamāt ayīsiyiniw <footnote_3> wāpiskiwiyāsah . kahkiyaw käkway kīh-miyik kit-ōh-pimātisit : mōhkumān , pāskisikan, kit-āpatsihtāt kahkiyaw käkway pāskisikäwin. äkusi äkutah uhtsi kiskinōhamawāw kit-äsi-pamihtāt pāskisikan . äkutah uhtsi akwah ati-miyw-āyāwak ayīsiyiniwak . kitahtawa akutah uhtsi piyisk atimwah <footnote_4> ayāwäwak , äh-utāpahātsik . ōtäh pikuh nimitāw ayīsiyiniwak ukīh-ayāwāhtawāw kayahtä misatimwah ; nama wīhkāts uhts āyāwäw ayīsiyiniw nātakām k-ätapit . 
<footnote_3> Here unmistakably " Indian " ; below ndhiyaw : " Cree " ( kept in translation ) is probably meant in the same way . The proper term wdpiski-wiyds : " white-flesh , white man " alternates with moniyaw : " Canadian " ( kept in translation )
<footnote_4> Properly " dogs " , but often used for misatim : " horse " case is shown by the next sentence .
<translation> When the others arrived there , they shook each other by the hand and greeted each other . For , indeed , thus it was that the Indian first saw the Whiteskin . They gave him everything to live by : the knife and the gun and all kinds of ammunition for his use . So then he began to be taught how to take care of a gun . From that time on the Indians were well off . At a certain time after this they began to have horses to pull their loads . And , strangely enough , it was only the people in the south who had horses ; the Indian who dwells in the north from that time to this has never had horses.

"
<translation> Presently , because they had no way of worship , presently a certain man whose children had suffered to the point of death from thirst , for it seems that of old nothing ever grew from the earth ; only grass ripened , then a certain man who was very good, was told by the dwellers in the sky , " Now , I will take you whence you will have your source of life . "
