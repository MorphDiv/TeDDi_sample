These functions allow you to work with arbitrary-length integers using GNU MP library.






Nota:

However, most of these functions will accept also numeric and string arguments, given it 's possible to convert the latter to number.
Also, if there 's faster function that can operate on integer arguments, it would be used instead of slower function when supplied arguments are integers.
This is done transparently, so the bootom line is that you can use integers in every function that expects GMP number.
See also gmp_init() function.
Ejemplo 1.


This will calculate factiorial of 1000 (pretty big number) very fast.
