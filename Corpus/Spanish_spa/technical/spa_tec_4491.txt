It 's written to be very modular, with plugable drivers.




There is also support for calendar triggers (alarms) and reoccuring events.
With libmcal, central calendar servers can be accessed and used, removing the need for any specific database or local file programming.
To get these functions to work, you have to compile PHP with --with-mcal.
That requires the mcal library to be installed.

The following constants are defined when using the MCAL module:
MCAL_SUNDAY, MCAL_MONDAY, MCAL_TUESDAY, MCAL_WEDNESDAY, MCAL_THURSDAY, MCAL_FRIDAY, MCAL_SATURDAY, MCAL_RECUR_NONE, MCAL_RECUR_DAILY, MCAL_RECUR_WEEKLY, MCAL_RECUR_MONTHLY_MDAY, MCAL_RECUR_MONTHLY_WDAY, MCAL_RECUR_YEARLY, MCAL_JANUARY, MCAL_FEBRUARY, MCAL_MARCH, MCAL_APRIL, MCAL_MAY, MCAL_JUNE, MCAL_JULY, MCAL_AUGUGT, MCAL_SEPTEMBER, MCAL_OCTOBER, MCAL_NOVEMBER, and MCAL_DECEMBER.
