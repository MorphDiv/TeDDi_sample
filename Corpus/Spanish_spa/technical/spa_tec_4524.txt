Shmop is an easy to use set of functions that allows php to read, write, create and delete UNIX shared memory segments.
The functions will not work on windows, as it does not support shared memory.
To use shmop you will need to compile php with the --enable-shmop parameter in your configure line.
Nota:
The functions explained in the chapter begin all with shm_() in PHP 4.0.3, but in PHP 4.0.4 and later versions these names are changed to begin with shmop_().
Ejemplo 1.

?php / / Create 100 byte shared memory block with system id if 0xff3 $shm_id = shmop_open( 0xff3, "c", 0644, 100); if(!$shm_id) {echo "Couldn't create shared memory segment\n";} / / Get shared memory block's size $shm_size = shmop_size($shm_id); echo "SHM Block Size: ".$shm_size. "has been created.\n"; / / Lets write a test string into shared memory $shm_bytes_written = shmop_write($shm_id, "my shared memory block", 0); if($shm_bytes_written != strlen("my shared memory block")) {echo "Couldn't write the entire length of data\n";} / / Now lets read the string back $my_string = shmop_read($shm_id, 0, $shm_size); if(!$my_string) {echo "Couldn't read from shared memory block\n";} echo "The data inside shared memory was: ".$my_string ."\n"; / /Now lets delete the block and close the shared memory segment if(!shmop_delete($shm_id)) {echo "Couldn't mark shared memory block for deletion.} shmop_close($shm_id);?
