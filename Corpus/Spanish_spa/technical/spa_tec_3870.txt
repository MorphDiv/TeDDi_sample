(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
The PDF_add_outline() function adds a bookmark with text text that points to the current page.
The bookmark is inserted as a child of parent and is by default open if open is not 0.
The return value is an identifier for the bookmark which can be used as a parent for other bookmarks.
Therefore you can build up hierarchies of bookmarks.
Unfortunately pdflib does not make a copy of the string, which forces PHP to allocate the memory.
Currently this piece of memory is not been freed by any PDF function but it will be taken care of by the PHP memory manager.
