(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
The PDF_set_font() function sets the current font face, font size and encoding.
If you use pdflib 0.6 you will need to provide the Adobe Font Metrics (afm-files) for the font in the font path (default is. / fonts).
If you use php3 or a version of pdflib older than 2.20 the fourth parameter encoding can take the following values:
0 = builtin, 1 = pdfdoc, 2 = macroman, 3 = macexpert, 4 = winansi.
An encoding greater than 4 and less than 0 will default to winansi. winansi is often a good choice.
If you use php4 and a version of pdflib = 2.20 the encoding parameter has changed to a string.
Use 'winansi', 'builtin', 'host', 'macroman' etc. instead.
If the last parameter is set to 1 the font is embedded into the pdf document otherwise it is not.
To embed a font is usually a good idea if the font is not widely spread and you cannot ensure that the person watching your document has access on fonts in the document.
I font is only embedded once even if you call PDF_set_font() several times.
Nota:
This function has to be called after PDF_begin_page() in order to create a valid pdf document.
Nota:
If you reference a font in a .upr file make sure the name in the afm file and the font name are the same.
Otherwise, the font will be embedded several times (Thanks to Paul Haddon for finding this.)
