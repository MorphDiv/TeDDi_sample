<translation>	The people of old were in a piteous state , when first they lived here on earth . The Higher Powers had put them down here with nothing at all . They went naked . They had no clothes , no knives . All they had for a knife was a bone . From the beginning they had no fire . With merely an arrow they killed animals , fastening bones to their arrows . They had nothing ; they were in a piteous state . Presently they made fire for themselves , doing it like this ; when it was hot , they got fire from it . Also they pounded a stone , and when it sent out sparks , from this , too , the people got fire . Their pots and kettles were of earth . Also , they would dig a hole and put in a hide , and heat some stones ; in this way they cooked meat . Then in time they began to have beaver-pelts for their clothes .

<translation>	Then at one time a certain man dreamt that the Canadian , the White Man , would land here . He told when they would land . Truly , he was not given credence ; only some believed him . Then moved their camp out there to the east , close to the great sea .

<paragraph_3>	" äkwah wīpats kā-wīh-pä-kapātsik ! " itwäw ; " māskōts ahpōh mituni kiyipah , " itäw ayīsiyiniwah . 
<translation>	" Now the time is close at hand when they will land ! " he said ; " Surely very soon , " he told the people .

<paragraph_4>	tahtuh kīkisäpā ntaw-ay-itāpiw māna nipīhk . kītahtawä kā-pätsāpahtahk tsīmānah . 
<translation>	Every morning he would go and look out upon the water . Then at one time he saw boats coming .

<footnote_3>	Here unmistakably " Indian " ; below ndhiyaw : " Cree " ( kept in translation ) is probably meant in the same way . The proper term wdpiski-wiyds : " white-flesh , white man " alternates with moniyaw : " Canadian " ( kept in translation )
<footnote_4>	Properly " dogs " , but often used for misatim : " horse " case is shown by the next sentence .
<translation>	When the others arrived there , they shook each other by the hand and greeted each other . For , indeed , thus it was that the Indian first saw the Whiteskin . They gave him everything to live by : the knife and the gun and all kinds of ammunition for his use . So then he began to be taught how to take care of a gun . From that time on the Indians were well off . At a certain time after this they began to have horses to pull their loads . And , strangely enough , it was only the people in the south who had horses ; the Indian who dwells in the north from that time to this has never had horses.

<translation>	Presently , because they had no way of worship , presently a certain man whose children had suffered to the point of death from thirst , for it seems that of old nothing ever grew from the earth ; only grass ripened , then a certain man who was very good, was told by the dwellers in the sky , " Now , I will take you whence you will have your source of life .

<translation>	Then truly he was taken to the place of the noonday sky , even as he slept ; dreaming of that place , he was told by the Higher Powers of the Sun-Dance Lodge . The people were given the annual performance of this rite . And at the same time he was taught how to perform it ; by the dwellers in the sky he was taught . Surely it would be well , if it were always permitted to the Indian ; so we think . Crops would always grow well . The Sun-Dance Lodge is not an evil thing . To be sure, " The Cree perform all kinds of evil things for the Evil Spirit , " say the missionaries . On the contrary : the Cree was not put down here on earth with these things ; the Cree has never known and does not know an Evil Spirit or a Son of God ; and the Cree does not know him who is called the Evil One . But rather , well may the Cree believe that the Spirit looks with kindlier pity on him , since he is never killed by winds . Never is a Cree killed by wind . Never is a Cree killed by the Thunderers . Never is a Cree killed by fire . That is why we think that the Cree is favored by the Higher Powers . Perhaps it is because he has angered the Spirit by putting a stop to the Sun-Dance Lodge , that in such numbers they break up the Canadian's towns ; so we think ; and that every day fire destroys the wooden houses every day we learn that everywhere houses have caught fire , every time we go to town . And every summer we hear that in many places towns have been destroyed by windstorms . It is not an evil thing which the Spirit has given to us , but ways of worship , only that good things may be prayed for . Thus did the Spirit set us down here on earth , us who are Cree . Strange , that some dances which arose much later are not stopped by the White Man , dances in which various things are used up , while the Sun-Dance involves no waste . It was given to the Cree , every year , for two days to go without eating , and to pray that all things might grow well , and to pray for rain. It was thus that the poor Indian was set down here on earth .
<footnote_1>	The actor "they" probably refers to the Thunderers.

<translation>	I too shall be glad to have my speech go far abroad , I who am blind . For from the time I was born , I have been blind . Never have I seen the earth . Yet when from time to time I mean to go anywhere , I go there ; I never get lost .

<translation>	So much for this , for this one story .
