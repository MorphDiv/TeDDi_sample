同志亦凡人中文站原创翻译 请勿删改
When the union's inspiration through the workers' blood shall run 当工会的斗志通过工人的血液流淌
there can be no power greater anywhere beneath the sun 没有更大的力量普照世界的阳光
yet what force on earth is weaker 地球上什么最弱小
than the feeble strength of one 那就是个人力量
But the union makes us strong 可是工会使我们强壮
solidarity forever 永远团结一致
solidarity forever 永远团结一致
solidarity forever 永远团结一致
for the union makes us strong 因为工会使我们强壮
Of unprecedented violence 伴随前所未有的暴力
and with the strike now entering its fourth month 以及罢工进入到第4个月
the government today insisted that it will push ahead 政府今天坚持执行原计划
with plans to close 20 pits with the loss of over 20,000 jobs 关闭了20个煤矿 导致超过两万人失业
an action that Mr.

You can look back in 10 years 十年后回顾今天
and you can say, "in 1984, I was proud and privileged" 你可以说 "在1984年 我非常骄傲和荣幸"
"to be a party to the greatest struggle on earth." "投身于这个世界上最伟大的抗争"
I left my number.

Everything's at stake for me.

Maybe see you on the march, then?

I'm fighting for their jobs for future, not just for me own.

We've used us savings up, we've no money left.

All we've got now is us pride and self

and we'll carry on keeping that.

The prime minister today defended her position.

I can't change my style.

It has to be a style of firm leadership.

One isn't here to be a softie.

You're here to be a good, firm leader.

- Hey, mark, do you want to play ball?

- Here you go, mark.

I've spoken to the council about your deviant parties.

There's no need to do that.

- They're sending a policeman.

Mark.

Thanks.

The riot squad the helmeted policemen with their plastic shields 防暴队和配备警盔以及塑胶盾牌的警察
were deployed after smoke bombs were thrown...

Thanks, dad.

Two, four, six, eight!

Is that copper really straight?

Two, four, six, eight!

Two, four, six, eight!

Two, four, six, eight!

Oi, grab hold of this, will you, mate?

Oh, no, sorry.

Just for five minutes, till me friends get here.

It...

Is it your first pride?

Yeah, first anything.

Yeah, well, this is the best way.

The thing is is that I'm actually from bromley.

Well, don't worry about that, we're a broad church.

No, I mean, it's the train.

It's further out than people think and I...

Oi, I've been dragging this thing on me own since marble arch.

What, are they buckets?

Surprised you have to ask that question, Mike, coming from accrington 你居然敢问这个问题 来自阿克林顿的麦克 (英格兰西北小镇)
Mike, does anything get rid of love bites?

- No.

Where exactly have you been?

I want everyone to take a bucket and start rattling.

- This is for the miners.

We agreed on a banner, mark.

It's a show of solidarity.

Who hates the miners?

Who else?

- That sound familiar?

The only problem we've got that they haven't is Mary whitehouse 我们和他们唯一的差别在于我们还要面对玛丽·惠特豪斯 (英国恐同内政大臣)
And that can only be a matter of time.

- Mark...

It's not been thought through but it's a really good idea, isn't it?

Isn't it?

What am I supposed to do with this?

Give it to the lesbians.

Oh, for God's sake.

Right, looks like you're off the hook, mate.

Whatever mark says, we do it.

- Disgusting.

We're collecting for the miners and their families, guys.

Gays and lesbians support the miners and their families.

I was wondering, do you need a hand?

Well, well, if it isn't bromley.

I mean, my last train is actually not for ages.

Gays and lesbians support the miners.

Gays and lesbians support the miners.

Gays and lesbians support the miners.

support the miners.

Guys, support the miners.

Gays and lesbians support the miners.

Support the miners.

Support the miners!

It's just a couple of the lads from college 就是一些学院的人
and one of them lives in Chislehurst.

So he can't be too late, either.

Just mind yourself on that last train.

There's weirdos and all sorts on there.

Thanks, mum.

Oi, bromley.

Over here.

I'm hiding from that girl.

Why?

She broke my heart at a Smiths concert.

I've never met a lesbian before.

Really?

I live at home.

No shit.

Is that where you got that lovely broach?

That's embarrassing.

It's today.

What are you, 10?

I'm 20.

I wouldn't go spreading that around.

You're illegal, darling.

Sixteen for the breeders, 21 for the gays.

Did you learn nothing on that march?

You're still a minor.

Jesus.

Victory to the minors.

Don't make a mess, okay?

They've counted it.

Well, come on, you've collected as much as anyone.

Stephanie.

Were you with Jeff in the bell last night?

For fuck's sake.

No red wine on the floor, please.

It was a pretty good march today.

Not much in the way of beatings or abuse.

Hardly any petrol bombs or swastikas.

Is it me or are the police getting soft?

It's funny.

What's that about?

Do you think they've finally got sick of all that Donna summer?

No, never!

My guess is they went somewhere else.

To pick on someone else.

My guess is that while we're enjoying 我认为 就在我们享受
a temporary reprieve, they're here.

Giving these poor sods the shit we usually get.

Now, these mining communities are being bullied just like we are.

Bullied by the police.

Bullied by the tabloids.

Do any of them need a hug?

No.

Yeah, because the miners have always come to our aid, haven't they?

Why don't we talk about today?

Today, with only a couple of buckets, we raised nearly 200 quid.

Right, think what we could achieve if we really started trying.

I'm from Durham.

Well, you know exactly what we're talking about, then.

I know those bastards kicked the shit out of me 我知道那些混球把我踹得鼻青脸肿
every morning on my way to school 无论是每天早晨的上学
and every night on my way home.

We are proposing to meet at least once a week.

And just to do as many collections as we can.

And we've got a name.

LGSM.

Lesbians and gays support the miners.

It's not very catchy.

It's a support group, Steph, not a skiffle band.

Right, come on.

Who's in?

Come on, guys, please.

Oh, come on, guys.

Is that it?

We've actually been looking for things 事实上我们一直想做些事情
that we could do together as a...

Well, this is perfect.

Youse can feed the miners and your relationship.

How many's that?

- It's better than five.

Jonathan.

Oh, God.

Brilliant party, Geth.

I'm sure you could use the back room here 我可以让你们使用里屋
if you're looking for a base, that is.

We are...

Well, what about me and Jonathan?

Or is it exclusively for the under

Oh, no, of course not.

are you sure Jonathan's interested?

He's at a bit of a loose end at the moment.

He just needs something to occupy him.

What about bromley over there?

I've...

Good.

You're the founder members of lesbians and gays support the miners.

Terrific.

Support for the miners.

Give generously.

Put your hand in your pockets for the miners.

Lesbians and gays support the miners!

National union of mine workers.

Oh, hello.

called lesbians and gays support the miners and...

Hello?

And there's the desired consistency.

It's glossy and wobbly.

Glossy and wobbly.

Jonathan.

Why don't you go out with them today?

Because I've got better things to do 因为我有更好的事情可做
than run around with a bunch of kids.

What happened to gay lib, Jonathan?

I don't know.

Is that gethin's boyfriend?

Jonathan.

He's an actor.

Support the miners.

- Lesbians and gays support the miners, sir.

Lesbians and gays support the miners.

We've raised money and we're looking for a mining community to...

Repeat the name of the group, please?

Lesbians and gays support the miners.

Somebody will call you back in due course.

Sure, but you've said that before and we...

They'll call back.

They will.

Mark, face it.

They're on strike.

They don't want to take our money because we're poofs.

- And a dyke.

Maybe we should just hand the money over anonymously.

I mean, we don't have to say we're gay, do we?

No.

Well, at least then we'd be helping.

No, this is a gay and lesbian group 这是一个男女同性恋组织
and we are unapologetic about that.

Jesus, why are you even wasting time with all this?

- Mark.

It has nothing to do with the fact that we're poofs.

- And a dyke.

They're never going to call us back.

Someone needs to go with him.

First rule of the group.

I'll go.

Thank you, Steph.

Lesbians and gays support the miners.

Lesbians and gays support the miners.

Pervert!

First rule of the group, comrade.

Lesbians and gays support the miners.

Lesbians and gays support...

Gethin.

Gethin, come on.

We don't have maps, mark.

People ask for the poems of Walt Whitman.

I hope there's a good reason why 希望有个合理理由解释
I've been abandoned in the street?

Let me just get this right, so we are going to pick a mining town 我想跟上你的思维 所以我们要找一个矿镇
completely at random and just ring it, is that the plan, is it, mark?

Yeah, the town hall, the council.

What, it's as easy as that?

Why not?

- I think it's inspired.

See.

Right, here we go.

A

Somewhere north...

Humberside.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

If it's miners you're looking for...

There.

Of course.

That's a big fucking coalfield.

That's the Brecon Beacons.

That's a coalfield, there.

All right, and what are we supposed to do?

- Stick a bloody pin in it?

No, I haven't been back there in 16 years.

Why not?

Well, let's just say there isn't 简单的说就是
always a welcome in the hillsides.

Shall I get you the phone book?

Well, what's the worst that can happen?

Oh, hello.

May I inquire about your communal baths?

What's that got to do with a strike?

Nothing.

All right, all right.

If we're going to do this, we need to take it seriously.

0

What's the welsh for lesbian?

Hello?

Yes.

I see.

Yes!

Solidarity forever 永远团结一致
solidarity forever 永远团结一致
solidarity forever 永远团结一致
it really didn't occur to you to get a description?

Well, she were off the phone that fast.

Maybe we should try and look more obviously gay.

Achievable goals, please, Jeff.

- Shut up.

Oh, my God, he's coming towards us.

How did you know it were him?

It's the same as in a nightclub.

It's all in the eyes.

I'm Dai Donovan.

From the Dulais valley.

- You must be Mark.

Hiya.

Steph.

- Hello.

- Jeff.

So, LGSM.

You get a garbled message over the phone.

I thought the L was for London.

London something.

I never dreamed for a moment it was L for...

Hi.

This money you've raised, it's all from gays and lesbians?

Mostly, yeah.

Right.

This is just the beginning.

Mmm

I'm not going to pretend I'm not surprised.

Truth told, you're the first gays I've ever met in my life.

As far as you're aware.

That's true.

And you're the first miner I've ever met.

Yeah.

Now, I...

I want you to go back to your community and convey my thanks 我需要你回到你的族群 转达我的谢意
My personal thanks.

And the thanks of all the people of Dulais.

Yeah, of course we will.

- Won't we?

Won't we, Mark?

Who fancies a pint?

- You can have five minutes.

- Dead sure.

Oh, I'm all right, lad.

Trust me, dai, if you can handle this 相信我 达伊 如果你能做到
it's going to make a huge difference.

What's he going to do, take his clothes off?

I'm just going to say thank you.

Well, don't blame me if you get bottled.

Right, shut up, you fuckers!

Thank you.

- My name is mark Ashton.

I'm going to invite somebody onto the stage now 我想邀请一个人上来来
who wants to talk to you and I want you to listen to him.

He comes from the dulais valley in South wales and he 他从南威尔士的杜莱思村来的
Well, he's a striking miner 他是一位罢工的矿工
and he has something he wants to say to you.

I've had a...

I've had a lot of new experiences during this strike.

Um, speaking in public.

Standing on a picket line.

And now I'm in a...

Well, if you don't like it, you can go home.

As a matter of fact, I do like it.

Beer's a bit expensive, mind.

But really, there's only one difference 可是真的 这里和南威尔士酒吧
between this and a bar in South wales.

The women.

They're a lot more feminine in here.

What I'd really like to say to you tonight is thank you.

If you're one of the people that's put money in these buckets 如果你是那些往募捐桶里放过钱的人
if you've supported LGSM, then thank you 如果你支持矿同联盟 那么谢谢你们
because what you've given us is more than money, it's friendship.

And when you're in a battle 当你身处一场战役
against an enemy so much bigger, so much stronger than you 面对比你庞大得多 强大得多的敌人
well, to find out you had a friend you never knew existed 发现你还有一个朋友 一个从不知道的朋友
well, that's the best feeling in the world.

So, thank you 所以谢谢你们
Lesbians and gays support the miners.

Support the miners.

So you're the only girl?

That's right.

Good speech.

Thank you.

I've worked a few tough crowds myself over the years.

- In politics?

Oh 噢
Okay,LGSM, over here, please.

- That's something else we could use.

An official photographer.

Jesus, mark.

Nice and close, please.

I could do it.

I've got a camera.

It's a really good one.

All right, bromley, if you're sure.

Course he's sure.

Never let it be said that LGSM discouraged youth enterprise.

Right, then.

Victory to the miners!

Victory to the miners!

Martin, come on.

Tell them you've run a whole canteen before.

You're not just packing food parcels.

Go.

And don't look so bloody worried.

It's not the first day of school.

What do they need to come here for?

Every other support group has been invited.

Every other support group was approved by the whole committee 其他所有被这个委员会所认可的组织
Oh, I see.

Dai had to make a snap decision.

This is all my fault.

He was in London, Maureen.

What would you have done?

I'll tell you exactly what I would have done...

But they raised the money.

All right, I run a civil meeting here.

If you want to scream and shout, get on the pickets.

I don't have a problem with what they are.

None of us do.

It's the men.

Well, you bring a load of gays 如果你把一群同性恋
into a working men's club, you get trouble.

I'm sorry.

No other group has raised as much money.

I'm not disputing that.

Or been so consistent.

Then why don't you just invite them?

I'm sorry, but everyone's saying they don't have a problem 抱歉 可是既然人人都说不存在问题
Good, they've raised the most money, so invite them.

And who the bloody hell are you?

- You did what?

But Hefina, she's like the head honcho, absolutely terrifying 可是海菲娜 她算是议会的管事 非常可怕
well, she obviously can't stand this Maureen.

Kids, mind the fish fingers.

What's the matter?

I'm not talking about that.

We're trying to fit in here, sian.

What?

Volunteer, I said.

They didn't want me on the canteen.

They wanted me on the committee.

All right, so keep your head down.

Don't start stirring it all up 别开始搅事出风头
inviting a load of gays and lesbians.

Oh, it's like that, is it?

You know, I had you down as many things 我可能很多事都让你不爽
but prejudiced was never one of them.

- I'm not prejudiced.

I'm a realist.

And I know exactly how those lads are going to react.

- You think so?

I'm standing on a bloody picket with them day after day.

It was a majority decision.

Well, I hope you and your bloody committee 我希望你和你的该死委员会
can guarantee their safety, sian, I do, I really do.

All aboard the deviants bus.

No pushing, no community singing.

And absolutely no back

Right, where are we going?

Wales.

Fuck me.

What I'd like to know is what bromley told his mum and dad.

Yeah.

I just...

Come on.

I said that I was doing so well at college 我说我在学院实习得很好
they were sending me on a residential course.

Doing what?

Choux pastry.

Bromley!

Bromley!

Bit late in the day for that, isn't it?

That's the fourth one I've done.

Fast as I put them up, they pull 'em down.

I'm running out of staples.

Every woman is a lesbian at heart 每个女人的内心都住着拉拉
every woman is a lesbian at heart...

you can't possibly say that every woman is a lesbian.

Why not?

'Cause they're not.

Esther Rantzen isn't a lesbian.

How do you know?

How do I know my mum's not a lesbian?

What he's trying to say is you can't 他想说的是 你们不能
make grand, sweeping generalizations.

It's not acceptable.

Every woman is a lesbian at heart 每个女人的内心都住着拉拉
every woman is a lesbian at heart 每个女人的内心都住着拉拉
every woman is a lesbian at heart 每个女人的内心都住着拉拉
including Reggie's mum 也包括雷吉的老妈
Look at the map.

How can that be a village?

－ Hang on a minute.

I think so.

Are we here?

We're here.

Oh, my God.

Come on, let's go.

Right, then.

I guess we just...

I think I'm starting to freak out slightly.

Dai, your gays have arrived.

Good to see you again.

Good to see you.

Hi, there.

Great to see you again.

Come on in.

Welcome, everybody.

How are you?

This is Gail and Sian, who wrote to you.

This is Hefina, who chairs the welfare committee.

This is Gwen, and this is cliff, our club secretary.

Um, I'm going to officiate you.

Oh, good.

Hold that and name here, please...

And in the corresponding box, the group or organization you represent 还有在联系栏写上你代表的组织名称
In this case...

Lesbians and gays support the miners.

Yep.

Thank you.

Thank you very much for having us.

Now, I'm hoping you can clear something up for me about lesbians 希望你们能帮我澄清一些关于女同性恋的知识
- Not now, Gwen.

and to be honest with you, it did surprise me.

Let them get settled in first, shall we?

Oh.

Now, who's making the speech?

A...

It's no big deal.

One of you just has to go up on stage and say a few words.

Just so we know who you are, like.

I'll tell the band to shut up and we'll push you on.

And welcome, all of you.

To be honest, I never thought you'd come.

Anybody else feel like appointing themselves leader?

Didn't think so.

Many Miles from home 回家的路迢迢
but I'm walking, walking 可是我走着 走着
walking for you 为你走下去
walking for you 为你走下去
now, then, ladies and gentlemen.

We're joined once again by one of our support groups 我们再次聚集在这儿 为了支持我们的组织
"Lesbians and gays support the miners" "男女同性恋支持矿工"
Will you welcome their spokesman onto the stage.

Thank you, dai.

Thank you, um...

Actually, dai Donovan made a speech at our local pub 事实上 达伊·多诺万在我们的酒吧发表过演说
and he's a pretty tough act to follow 要想和他比肩很难
so maybe now is the moment for my musical tribute to Judy Garland.

Look, we raised this money because we want to help you 我们筹款是因为我们想帮你们
And that's it.

And we'll keep on trying to help you for as long as you want us to 只要你们允许 我们会一直做下去
because we've been through 因为我们经历过
some of the same things you've been through.

Listen, if one in five people is gay 你们看 假如每五个人就有一个同志
then one in five miners must be, too, right?

So that's at least a fifth of you who's pleased to see us.

Thank you.

Thanks.

One, two, three, four...

Them falling leaves, they say that summer's done 树叶落了 他们说夏天过去
the wind and rains, they say so too 风风雨雨 也是一样
but ain't no winter skies'll ever shadow the sun 可是冬天也遮蔽不了阳光
while I'm with you 只要有我和你
night, everybody.

Goodnight, dai.

There we are.

It's teething problems, love.

Everything will be all right once they start to mix.

I'm not talking about running away.

I'm talking about making a dignified exit.

Tomorrow before dawn?

We can't just waltz into a town like this 我们不可能随便飘进一个村镇
and expect them not to...

Slit our throats?

Just be cautious.

I don't know about anybody else 我不知道你们怎么想
but I don't have to travel to wales to get my head kicked in.

I can very easily get that at home.

Anyone who wants to go should go.

- But I came here to help.

Well, they can tell me that to my face.

Until that time, I'm a member ofLGSM 在那之前 我是矿同联盟的一员
and I'm going to do what I set out to do.

No hiding, no running away, no apologies.

Me, too.

Yeah.

And me.

And me.

This is a welsh castle, mind.

None of your Norman rubbish.

According to legend, the maiden Sabrina came here, see 根据传说 少女塞布丽娜来过这儿
and became the goddess of the river severn.

How'd she manage that, then, cliff?

By drowning.

"Sabrina fair listen where thou art sitting" "在此处停留 倾听塞布丽娜"
"under the glassie, cool, translucent wave" "她在澄清冰凉的浪花之下"
I grew up in northern Ireland.

I know all about what happens when people don't talk to each other 我完全知道当人们拒绝交谈会引发什么
That's why I've never understood 所以我才完全不明白
what's the point of supporting gay rights but nobody else's rights?

Or workers' rights but not women's rights.

It's...

There's a lodge banner down in the welfare, over 100 years old.

We bring it out for special occasions, you know.

I'll show it to you one day.

It's a symbol, like this.

Right?

That's what the labor movement means.

You support me, I support you.

Whoever you are.

Shoulder to shoulder.

Dai!

There they go.

They're bringing them in from London, from Bristol.

They're pulling the lads in for anything now.

Well, they can't do that.

There's two from my street in custody right now.

Where's your humanity?

We're citizens of this country, mind.

No, I mean, they can't do that.

It's totally illegal.

A police officer has the right to stop you 一个警察有权阻止你
if, and that's the important word here 仅当 这个前提很重要
if he has reasonable grounds to believe a crime is going to be committed 仅当他有合理依据相信一桩犯罪将会发生
Now, you're absolutely sure about this?

Police harassment, dear.

And if he does?

Then he must formally charge you within 24 hours of that arrest 那他在逮捕你的24小时内必须对你提起正式指控
But "reasonable grounds" means concrete evidence 但是"合理依据"意味着实在的证据
that can stand up in court.

It doesn't mean he doesn't like the look of you.

That's the same whether you're standing on a picket line 这同样适用于你们站在警戒线最前
or trolling down clapham high street in full drag.

Hefina, tell Martin to mind the kids.

Where you going?

The police station.

She's finding her feet.

Right, gentlemen, listen to me.

A police officer only has the right to detain a group of people...

You need evidence to stand up in a court of law.

They need concrete evidence.

If you keep them for longer than 24 hours...

No proof.

And I will not be leaving this desk until you do.

We've got all day, so chop

Nobody said anything about hiding who we are.

Yes, they did.

I just think if everybody takes it easy on the...

Flamboyance.

Then we're more likely to fit in.

I'm sorry just to be clear, when you say flamboyance you mean gay?

And when you say everyone, you mean me?

- Jonathan.

It's just I haven't spoken 1950s in quite a while.

Over here, please.

You'll stay for a pint?

No, you're all right, cliff.

Welfare's had a change of atmosphere, if you know what I mean.

I don't know what you mean, Lee, no.

- He means these faggots.

If it wasn't for those people over there 如果不是因为那边那些人
you lot would still be in the Nick.

- What?

They make me sick, that's all I know, dai.

That's enough.

Physically sick.

－ Gays?

They were the ones, Carl.

I thought Sian got us out.

They told her...

- Carl.

What's going on?

No, it's all right.

We're LGSM.

My name's mark Ashton.

You'll have a pint, will you, mark?

What I was told about lesbians really did shock me.

It can't be true, can it?

You're all vegetarians?

Actually, Zoe and I are both vegans.

So, you live together like, you know, husband and wife.

But what I want to know is...

I know what you're going to say.

Which one does the housework?

Oh, well, that's...

- Are you joking?

It's embarrassing enough they spend one night on dai's floor, Maureen 让他们在达伊的地板上挤一晚已经够失礼了 莫琳
From here on in the hosting committee's 从现在开始委员会的成员
going to bloody well start hosting.

I'm sorry, not me.

What?

It's not a trivial matter, sian.

I don't mind taking more, Hefina.

Not the lesbians so much because of their cuisine.

But I'll take an extra gay.

I tell you something right now, Maureen Barry 我现在就跟你说清楚 莫琳·巴瑞
if you get aids, so help me God, I'll nurse you myself.

Though how you're going to get aids from a couple of sleeping bags 只是就靠你客卧的几个睡袋 你要怎么得艾滋
in your extension, I don't know.

Listen, it's fine.

No.

Think it's going to be that easy, do you?

You just bulldoze the whole village 你威胁整个村子的人
into thinking the same thing as you.

I don't need to bulldoze anyone.

It's you who's got the problem.

They're all in there getting along perfectly well.

Oh, really?

What the hell do you think you're doing?

I'm just talking to kev about something.

You can talk to kev any day of the week.

Get over there and find a gay or a lesbian right now.

Look, Hefina, I've shaken their hands.

I don't want to labor the point, do I?

I might, you know, give them the wrong impression.

Right.

Because you're so bloody irresistible, is that it, Carl Evans?

Listen to me.

round my back yard with no clothes on since you were this high.

And I can tell you right now, these gays have thrown better away.

Now, move yourself.

this is a first, this.

Men on the dance floor.

You can't be serious!

Welsh men don't dance, do they, sian?

Never.

Well, why don't we show them what they're missing?

oh, my God.

come on!

God, I miss disco.

Everyone back to mine for a nightcap.

What?

For God's sake.

What did I bloody say to you, eh?

Showing us up in front of our guest.

Don't worry.

Cheers, mate.

Oi.

- He's going to give him dance lessons.

You'll start prancing about like that?

Listen, if you're going to spend the rest of your life 听着 如果你打算把剩下的生命
standing at the bar wishing you could speak to Debbie Thomas 都花在吧台边 希望能够和黛比·汤姆斯搭讪
that's fine by me.

I'm going to be a woman magnet.

Where the bloody hell did you get that?

I don't know why you're so het up.

They're going in the morning.

Well, this strike matters to you two, does it?

Of course it does.

What do you think people will say when they hear about this?

We're being backed up by perverts.

You want people taking the piss, do you?

Scabs?

Calling us all sorts of names?

No.

I know one thing.

Your father would never have stood for it.

That went well, considering...

Considering?

Sometimes people can surprise you, that's all I'm saying.

I never had a problem with it, sian.

Well, I'm glad to hear it, because this is Joe.

And he's going to be sleeping in our house.

How do?

Nice to meet you.

No need to do the full Barry White, Martin.

He knows you're heterosexual.

This is fine.

I think we should take him to the door.

No.

Just drop me here.

All right.

Hang on a minute.

What is it?

Got to keep up the fiction.

See you.

Mmm.

It was the best experience of my entire life.

Making pastry?

You wanna start something, you start it with me!

Lesbians and gays support the miners.

Thank you.

Let's keep it moving, girls.

Just put it in.

Victory to the miners!

Lesbian and gays support the miners.

Any donations, sir?

Don't worry about me freezing to death in Brixton, will you?

Aren't you going to ring your mum?

What for?

Here you are, love.

Why don't I pretend to be your girlfriend?

That way you get an alibi and I get to watch the sound of music.

- Come to ours, Steph.

Yeah.

No queen's speech.

Oh, sounds like heaven.

Support the miners.

A very happy Christmas to you, too.

There is now a danger 现在有种危险
that has become a threat to us all.

It is a deadly disease and there is no known cure.

- The virus can be...

passed during sexual intercourse with an infected person.

Aids.

Anally injected death sentence.

Will you switch that off, please, Tony?

But it's spreading...

- Thank you.

Hello?

Can I speak to Jonathan, please?

Uh, no, he's being creative in the kitchen, I'm afraid.

Take a message.

I just wanted to thank him for his beautiful card.

Homemade, too.

My husband was particularly impressed with it.

I'll be sure to tell him.

Is that a welsh accent I can hear?

Uh, oh, maybe.

I haven't been home in a long time so...

We're looking forward to seeing them all back here soon 我们非常期待尽快能再见到他们
Wish Jonathan a happy Christmas from all of us in Dulais, will you?

Of course.

"Nadolig llawen" to you, my love.

Nadolig llawen.

The 1:

The coal board called a press conference 在昨晚谈判破裂后
in near despair today after the collapse of last night's talks 失望的国家煤炭局在今天举行了新闻发布会
The strike entered its 42nd week.

The union responded with a renewed attack on the government's 作为回应 工会开始抨击政府
latest cuts to benefits for the families of those on strike 最新的关于削减罢工家庭福利的措施
They're calling it an attempt by Mrs.

to starve the miners back to work.

Severe weather in England and Wales is set to continue...

Bloody hell.

Oh, Jesus.

Let's get the stuff unloaded 把物品卸下来
and shared out as fast as possible, yeah?

What the bloody hell am I doing?

Right, come on, then, you heard him.

There's noises in the village.

Small voices.

Nothing we can't handle but...

They want to go back?

They've been told they'll save the pits that go back first.

They won't but, uh, desperate people, they'll believe anything.

Tell him about the bus.

Our bus has broken down.

And our gas has been cut off, so...

We're having baths next door.

We're playing for a tin of beef now.

Remember, all your proceeds to the strike fund 记住所有的收益都会进入罢工基金
ladies and gents, so please dig deep.

There's a pair for you.

There you go.

Not even Kim wilde's got them in orange.

This is gethin.

Hello.

- He's a little nervous.

There's no need to be nervous, boy.

With a good welsh name like that?

Where are you from, then?

Rhyl, originally.

No.

Listen here, see.

We don't mind the gays and the lesbians, that's fine.

But don't you dare be bringing people from north wales down here.

Stupid bugger.

That bus is a lifeline.

It takes the food parcels to the remotest villages.

Without it...

All the fours, 44.

We need to start thinking in larger chunks of money 我们需要考虑筹到大额资金
because without it they're going to fail, it's as simple as that.

I'm sorry, but when are you going 抱歉 可是你什么时候
to address my question about a women's group?

Blind 70.

Stella, this is important.

I know.

What do you need a women's group for, anyway?

To address the women's issues.

Singly and in a safe environment.

What is unsafe about this environment?

I'm a woman, Mike.

I'm also a lesbian and a feminist.

Listen, love, I don't care if you're Arthur scargill.

Don't talk during the bingo.

Tickety

Thirty

For God's sake, leave him alone.

He's not a girls' world.

But we love him, mum.

Okay.

It's called the great Atlantic fault.

And, uh, and it starts here in Spain 它从西班牙开始
and then it goes under the bay of biscay 经过比斯开湾的下面
and then it comes up in South wales.

And then it goes under the Atlantic for Miles and Miles and Miles 然后它横跨无数英里 无数英里的大西洋
and it comes up again in Pennsylvania.

My father used to talk about it.

And mine.

"The dark artery" "黑色动脉"
That's it.

And you could take a miner from wales or Spain or America 你可以在威尔士或西班牙或美国随便找一个矿工
and you could show them that seam and they would recognize it.

There's no other coal like it.

I lost my younger brother to that pit.

Thirty

But without it, these villages are nothing, they're finished.

That's what I'd say 所以我说
if I ever came face

That's what I'd tell her.

The pit and the people are one and the same.

- Welcome home, son.

Listen to me, everyone.

Get your feet off those seats.

- We've let you down.

No, we have.

We haven't raised enough awareness.

Now, it's not enough to always be defending.

Sometimes you have to attack to push forward 有时候你必须攻击和推进
and that's exactly what we're going to do.

When we get back to London, and you have my word on this 等我们回到伦敦 我向你们坚决保证
we are going to...

We're going to do something so spectacular.

It'll be so incredible 它将无以伦比
so effective, that the national coal board, I promise you this 卓见成效 我跟你们保证会让全国煤炭局
will come crawling on their hands and knees 跪服到五体投地
In full drag 换上女装
to beg you for forgiveness.

Now, victory!

Victory to the miners!

As we come marching, marching 我们一路游行 游行
in the beauty of the day 在这一天的美丽
A million darkened kitchens 无数熄灭的灶台
A thousand mill lofts gray 无数灰色的纺机
are touched with all the radiance that a sudden sun discloses 都沐浴着红日 突然散放的光辉
for the people hear us singing 因为听到了我们的歌声
bread and roses.

As we go marching, marching 我们一路游行 游行
we battle too for men 和男人一样抗争
for they are women's children 因为他们是女人的孩子
and we mother them again 我们又再次母亲他们
our lives shall not be sweated 生命不该只有汗水
from birth until life closes 从出生到结束
hearts starve as well as bodies 哪怕身心一起挨饿
give us bread but give us roses 给我们面包 也给我们玫瑰
As we go marching, marching 我们一路游行 游行
unnumbered women dead 无数女性死去
go crying through our singing 在我们的歌声中呼唤
their ancient cry for bread 呼唤着面包的名
small art and love and beauty 爱和美丽的艺术
their drudging spirits knew 从未离开她们的劳碌灵魂
yes, it is bread we fight for but we fight for roses too 是的 我们为面包斗争 但我们也爱着玫瑰
Go back to where you came from!

We've come to take back our welfare.

What are you talking about?

From all your bloody queers.

What the hell's going on?

There's normal people who wanna drink in here as well, you know?

You listen to me.

Yeah?

Leave it, Martin.

Come on, leave it.

Come on, Martin.

You so much as lay one finger on anyone inside that hall 你敢碰里面任何人一根手指头
and so help me God, I'll break your bloody arms and legs for you.

Come on.

Bent bastards!

There you go.

but at least the beers will be cold.

- You want a beer, anyone?

I've got one, thanks, dai.

Here you go, Alan.

- I'm Gary.

Hi.

I want to learn to dance.

We need to make something happen.

Yeah, well, we do now, yeah.

Something big.

Something bigger than we've ever tried before.

Why don't you come inside?

It's morale.

It's just as important as money.

Because the minute they start to feel like a lost cause...

I know.

And there's nothing worse than a lost cause.

I'm in wales 我在威尔士了
and I don't have to pretend to be something that I'm not.

I'm home.

And I'm welsh.

That's right!

Get him another beer before he starts singing.

What I don't understand is why you never came back before.

My mother.

She couldn't accept me.

Not then, perhaps.

She's religious.

She hasn't said one word to me in 16 years.

And what about you?

you got a sweetheart, have you, love?

I'm a gobby northern lesbian, Gwen.

I tend to scare 'em off.

Look.

That's my William.

Forty

and I wish you as many with someone one day 我祝你某天找到你的她
And as happy.

Jesus, I'm pissed.

Alan, no!

Give us a hand, will you, Steph?

He's thrown up again.

They'd have a field day.

Why don't you come over to Dai's?

Just for a minute.

I think if you met one or two of them...

Have you seen this, cliff?

I don't believe what they say about us, Lee.

Why should I listen to what they say about them?

Get inside, you.

You're a respected woman, Maureen.

People follow you.

You're the backbone of that committee.

You've been both mother and father to those boys.

Sitting on your own in the dark, Maureen?

You wanna take that rod out of your arse for a minute.

Good luck.

Morning.

Thanks.

Hello?

I'm in a phone box so I'll have to be quick.

I got a story for your news desk.

Hello, mum.

Bye, bromley.

See you.

Hello, sailors.

Morning, ladies.

- Come on, maries.

With your bum chum.

What's going on?

Jesus.

"Perverts support the pits" "变态支持煤矿"

"From where I'm sitting, the noise is pretty deafening." "在我坐的地方 声音已经震耳欲聋了"
Unbelievable.

Who did this?

It'll have to go to a vote.

But I'm warning you, we can do without this kind of trouble 但我提醒你 我们可以省掉这些麻烦
This isn't trouble, it's mischief.

We've had worse than this before now.

Every day they're out collecting for us.

It's the men, dai.

They've already got their wives supporting them, and now this.

Gays.

It's about dignity.

It'll have to go to a vote.

Right.

They're calling an emergency meeting.

Dai's speaking up for us of course, but it's done a lot of damage 达伊当然站在我们这边 但已经造成了很多影响
Yeah, but we're not going to let a little thing like this break...

Down!

What's going on?

Bastards!

I don't care about what they do, but it's a distraction.

It's distracting people from the strike.

And then there's the children.

I mean, what example is it for kiddies 有这些男同女同在周围晃悠
to have gays and lesbians roaming around?

It's unnatural.

There used to be a tradition in wales of honoring your guests.

Do you remember that, ladies?

- Respect?

There's only one thing that's unnatural about this bloody business 整件该死的事只有一样是违反自然的
Betraying the community.

And when I find out who sold that story, believe me 等我找到这个兜售故事的人 相信我
they'll know what it feels like to be ashamed.

What the hell are we doing?

Now, let's just get this finished, mark.

No, no, I mean, what the hell are we doing?

They would never have known we were here if it wasn't for this article 如果不是这篇文章 人们根本不知道我们在这儿
- So?

So, what are you saying, mark, I should just send them the bill?

Do you know how many people read this paper?

This is our chance to do something spectacular.

We could never drum up this kind of publicity in a million years 我们再也找不出这样引发大众瞩目的好机会了
Mark, don't you just think we ought to hold back and regroup?

There isn't time to regroup.

Today.

- They called us perverts.

it's time for an important part of your education.

Hands up in this room if you've ever been called a name like that.

Now, there is a long and honorable tradition in the gay community 听着 同志社群有一个光荣悠久的传统
and it has stood us in good stead for a very long time.

When somebody calls you a name...

Am I right about this, Jonathan 看我说得对不对 乔纳森
Dead right.

You take it and you own it.

You owe me.

It's a fundraising concert 这是一个筹款音乐会
and we're looking for bands to...

No, no.

or indeed any other member of the police, is a pervert.

- Cool.

Oh, I can probably get you some more, next week if you want.

He'll call.

there are no gay artists on this label.

They don't have to be gay, that's the point.

This is a coming together of all different people...

Reception.

It arrived about 10 minutes ago, Barry.

Yeah, well, you could come down and get it.

What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?

That's the number for gay switchboard.

You never know, one of them might need it one day.

We'll be back in good time for the vote.

Right

Any problems, we can be reached at the bookshop.

You're gonna miss this train.

Rowena Roberts has had a baby.

She needs an extra box.

I can't hear you.

Rowena Roberts has had a baby.

Strange.

and the difference is this is open to everyone.

Gay, straight, it doesn't matter.

We want people to come together to show their support.

And why should gay people like me support the miners?

Because miners dig for coal, which produces power, 因为矿工挖煤 煤能发电
which allows gay people like you to dance to bananarama 然后你这样的同志才能在舞池跳"香蕉女郎" (80年代女子乐队)

Next question?

Are you all right?

Yes, you.

I've never met a pop star.

I have.

What's funny about that?

You need to push the t

This is a fundraiser.

Is he in charge?

He's the official photographer.

We don't want it to be all churchy.

It's a christening.

Yeah, but readings don't all have to come from the Bible, do they?

You can have all sorts of things nowadays.

It's more open.

Meeting's tomorrow afternoon.

We'll make it as long as we leave early enough.

And the vote?

At the end.

Single question 单一问题
can we continue taking your support in the light of recent events?

- "Recent events."

You won't have anything to worry about, I'm telling you.

When they see what you make out of this.

If we make anything out of this.

Are you joking, man?

Give it here.

This is the first gay club we've ever been to.

Yeah?

Oh.

We're miners.

That's perfect.

I don't think I could trust myself, do you?

Are you going to take my picture, then?

Well, it's incredible to see such a mix of people here tonight.

Gay and straight.

Can you see what we've done here?

By coming together, all of us, 我们通过聚到一起
by pledging our solidarity, 展现我们的团结
our friendship, we've made history.

Back in our...

Back in our miners' lodge, in wales 在我们威尔士的矿工之家
we have a banner.

And it's old, it's very old.

And it's this, two hands together.

Joined like this.

Well, I tell you now 我现在告诉你们
you've worn our badge, "coal not dole" 你们戴着我们的徽章 "煤炭不是施舍"
and when the time comes, you have my word on this 当时势需要 我向你们保证
we will wear yours.

Shoulder to shoulder.

Hand to hand.

Come on, then, that's right.

I hope you ladies aren't going to let me down.

What?

What, everything?

Even the rubber scene.

Sorry, ladies.

Oh, don't be daft, love.

Evening.

Hello.

how'd you get into that leotard, then?

Um, talcum powder.

What?

Talcum powder.

Oh.

Mark?

Oh, my God.

Tim.

Oh, this is insane.

I'm bumping into everybody tonight.

How are you?

You still changing the world?

- Bit by bit.

I haven't been home in four days.

Haven't you?

I'm on a farewell tour.

Where are you going?

You are a beautiful man, mark.

I miss you.

Please take care of yourself.

Please.

Come on.

Please take care.

Come on, then, girls.

Back to ours.

- I'm sorry.

Do you know what I was when I met Alan?

Drunk?

Sixteen.

Think that's ridiculous?

I was pretty then.

You're pretty now.

It all goes South, doesn't it?

Love.

That's cheery.

Sod it.

I always thought sex was for the men, really, anyway.

We just put up with it, don't we?

Okay.

I will listen to a certain amount of drunken bollocks, Gail, 我对醉话的容忍是有一个限度的 盖尔
but sex is not just for the men, 做爱并不只是男人的专利
it's for the women, too.

Oh, yeah.

Gail, come on.

No carpets.

This is Laura Ashley.

- Where?

What I want to know is...

What's this?

Hefina, you put that back immediately.

That's nothing.

Here, look what else I've found.

You never went under his bed.

When was the last time you saw anything like that?

Huh?

Don't those women ever sleep?

Jesus, God, that takes me back.

Mum.

So, what were their names again, boys?

Mine was Jess.

And mine was Carol.

Six straight people asked me 昨晚有六个直人问我
if they could join us last night.

We should set up another group.

Straights supporting gays supporting miners.

Right, that's it, we're off.

What about bromley?

He's too late.

The vote, remember?

Okay.

Surely you've got his number, Steph?

Nobody's got his number.

I'm sorry, but mark's right.

He's blown it.

Oh.

He was sucking face till the lights came up.

I wouldn't waste any time feeling sorry for him.

Can I please have an aspirin?

What the hell's this?

Plans change, cliff.

No answer.

They must be on their way.

Okay.

I can't speak in front of all these people, cliff.

I can't.

I know you think you know what you want, Joe, but you're so young.

That's what the law's for, to protect you.

I didn't know who I was at your age.

It's such a terrible life, Joe.

It's lonely.

Is that what you want?

No family?

Hiding from people at work, from everyone?

Keeping secrets?

Come here.

So now cliff will speak on behalf of the LGSM.

The floor's yours, cliff.

Um...

Well, what I want to say abo...

About the gays and lesbians...

Why don't you do us a poem, cliff?

Poem!

Poem!

I want to propose that this meeting is unlawful.

I want to propose that this meeting was brought forward unlawfully 我想提议这个集会被提前的程序不合法
and that most of the people here 你们在座的多数人
- aren't even from this village.

All right.

There we go.

Two hours to spare.

Hefina heddon, you drive like a bloody lunatic.

我的上帝
Gwen, look after the gays.

Right

3:

You can't dictate when the committee sits.

You told us 3:

And then we had to change it.

Bloody disgusting way to behave.

If you weren't up in London...

It's invalid.

We can fight it.

We've got one fight, dai.

The fucking strike.

Or have you forgotten that, all of you?

Dancing around in London.

The trouble with those people is they jump on the bandwagon.

- What?

They pretend they're backing you, but what they're really doing 他们假装支持你 可是他们真正做的
is pushing their own agenda.

Gay rights.

What?

We've seen articles, hefina.

Christ Jesus help me.

You better shut her mouth or I'm going to do it permanently.

No, come on, that's enough.

An official letter will be sent.

I can't...

To thank them most sincerely.

But the vote was we won't be accepting their support any more.

They're causing us embarrassment, dai, that's the thing.

And we're not strong enough, not now.

We're struggling to survive as it is.

Oh, that reminds me.

Courtesy of those people and their agenda.

Jesus Christ.

I don't suppose you opened your mouth, did you?

Didn't want to rock the boat, is that it?

There's bloody thousands here.

You think you've known someone your whole life.

Turns out they're a complete stranger.

I'd say the same about you, cliff.

I'll tell you something.

my brother would have wanted, you're wrong.

We came to help you win and if we're not helping, we have to go.

- This was all you.

It was.

All right.

Don't give it all to the fight.

Save some for home.

There's more to life, you know?

You girls have opened my eyes.

I'm going to extend my repertoire, you'll see.

The vegan Delia Smith.

Bye.

Bye.

Take care, now.

It's a bloody travesty, man.

- I don't accept it.

I don't.

They can't stop me from collecting money.

- Don't be crazy, gethin.

Somebody better tell lesbians against pit closures.

What now?

What do you mean?

- What are we doing?

Were you not paying attention?

And I don't know about you but I'm pissing off.

- Where?

- I'm out of here.

Do you think it might be possible that just for once 你觉得能不能就这么一次
you could make your own decision, Mike?

- You what?

you could stop following me around like a fucking spaniel 你可以别再像个跟屁虫一样的缠我
and let me have a life of my own?

Yeah.

Yeah, I think I could manage that, yeah.

Good.

Oh, fu...

Lesbians and gays support the miners.

Lesbians and gays support the miners.

Lesbians and gays support the miners.

Never mind the miners.

That's what you should be thinking about.

Not the bloody miners.

Asshole.

Excuse me?

Excuse me?

Excuse me.

I tell you what we'll do, let's come over here.

This is the key you swapped it to.

Is Joe there, please?

No, I'm afraid he's out.

Can you tell him that his friend gethin's in hospital?

It's very important.

He's in St.

Yes, of course I'll tell him.

And will you tell him that Steph called round to see how he was?

Who was that?

Tina.

You're back at the job centre tomorrow, don't forget.

I should have...

I should have said more.

I could have.

If you're going to cut, cut it straight.

Triangles.

I'm gay.

I know.

I've known for a little while now, cliff.

Since the gays arrived?

Well, I can't speak for the rest of the village 我不知道村子里别人怎么想
but speaking for myself, since about 1968.

Well...

Yeah.

What's that?

It's the new van.

About time, too.

What the hell's this?

New van.

Courtesy of our gay friends down in London.

I'm not getting in that.

Then you'll have to stay here.

In you get, lads.

You a lesbian, are you, love?

That's right.

Britain's longest running national strike is over.

Amongst scenes of bitterness and anger 在苦痛和愤怒的场景下
NUM delegates voted narrowly 全国煤矿工会代表以微弱多数
for an organized return to work on Tuesday.

Tomorrow most of britain's coal miners will return to work.

They say they'll march back, heads held high.

It's almost a year to the very day since they walked out...

Joe, have you seen the news?

Thank God for that.

Joe?

Bloody hell!

- Mark!

I was trying to make myself feel better and I failed.

I've been virtually under house arrest.

Stuck with my parents.

I haven't seen anyone.

I've tried ringing Steph but she's always...

Why don't you leave?

I did, last night.

I didn't even tell them I was going.

That's not leaving, it's running.

What are you going to do now?

Stay here.

And do what?

And get a job down the pit?

That's all they need, a trained pastry chef with a camera 正是他们需要的 一个拿照相机的见习点心师
When are you going to get some guts, huh?

You're a member of LGSM, bromley.

So stop sneaking out of your mammy's house 别再半夜三更偷偷溜出你妈妈的家门
in the dead of night and stand up for yourself.

Have some pride.

Because life is short, okay?

It's short.

Okay?

What should I tell the others?

Nothing.

You're a mad bugger.

I'm taking you home after that.

In the van.

Will you give this to Jeff, please, Joe?

Of course I will.

Come on.

What about gethin?

Gethin?

The last I heard he was back on the ward.

I don't like meltis fruits.

Well, then, maybe you won't go through them quite so fast.

Help me out with these, will you, bromley?

Stay in bed.

Keep an eye on Jonathan for me, will you?

He needs to take care of himself.

It's you we're taking care of, you daft sod.

If you could just make sure he's got some groceries in.

Gethin...

He's HIV

He's not supposed to smoke.

Please.

Gethin.

Hello.

This is my mum.

Hello.

Come in.

Back then, when they knew even less about this thing 开始的时候他们对这个病知之甚少
they gave out numbers with each diagnosis.

One, two, three and so on.

Course, when they got into the high thousands, it...

I'm number two.

Nobody knows what's keeping me alive.

I think it's the grass.

What are you going to do now?

Make you some soup.

Drive back to wales.

No, I mean with your life.

I'm a wife and mother, love.

My life goes back to normal now.

Well, it shouldn't.

You've a first

You should do something.

Don't waste it, sian.

There are young people dying every day now.

Good people.

Clever, promising.

Don't you dare waste it.

Oh, shit.

Excuse me.

Sorry.

What the hell is this?

Hello.

Will you please remove your van from my property?

I hope you appreciate him.

'Cause there's a whole village back in wales who thinks he's a hero 因为在威尔士有整村的人认为他是个英雄
Joe.

Mum, he's done this on purpose.

It's all right, I'm leaving.

I hope one day we can be friends again, mum.

Oi, you got something to say to your sister?

I've got something to say to you, Jason.

And Tina, that tight perm doesn't suit you.

I'm sorry.

Joe.

Joe.

You all right?

Cheers.

While you've been away, I've been changing my act.

Demure and accommodating, that's me.

The lesbian lady di.

I think I'd find that a tremendous disappointment.

I'm glad you came back, bromley.

It wasn't the same without you.

Thanks.

I'm glad I came back, too.

If we were normal, this is when we'd kiss.

- There's the rest of it.

"Screw you, Thatcher" or "fuck you"?

I can see the appeal of both.

Jonathan, "screw" or "fuck"?

"Screw." It's more visceral.

Attention, attention!

We have reason to believe that there are known homosexualists 我们有理由确信有数名已知男同份子
and a confirmed lesbo inside these premises 和一个确认的拉拉正在这栋居所内
and that they are armed with sewing machines and glitter 他们随身携带缝纫机和亮片
Now that you have made yourselves known to me 现在你们的身份已经暴露
I have a question for the notorious Accrington sodomite 我想问阿克宁顿来的臭名昭著的鸡奸者一个问题
known as Mike Jackson.

Will you please put that down?

We have a very good relationship with our neighbors.

Mike.

Mike.

I behaved like a prick before.

Do you forgive me?

Just...

There you go, bromley.

Happy Birthday.

Thank you.

Right.

And just for future reference...

My name's Joe.

You tell 'em, bromley.

Bromley!

Bromley!

Oi, haven't you heard about the miners, dearie?

They lost.

- Have you heard?

Mark's over with the steward now.

No slogans.

We're a mardi gras, apparently.

- There was a general feeling...

Amongst the committee 委员会内部认为
that people have become tired of politics and that this year 人们已经厌倦了政治 而这一年度
the tone should be celebratory.

With affirmative slogans and a positive atmosphere.

- Horse shit.

you'll have to march at the back with the fringe groups.

Mate, we're LGSM.

Congratulations.

- What?

Complete and utter bollocks.

What's LGSM's position?

We're going to march.

- Yes, but with banners or without?

With.

That's why we've decided to lead the fringe groups at the back.

Why would you be leading it?

- I'm not getting rid of the banner.

There's got to be some kind of compromise.

Why?

Because that's the way you get things done.

No, it fucking isn't.

Why does everything get so aggressive with you lot?

Listen to me.

Whether we march with banners or without 不管我们打不打旗子
the important thing is that we march together, all of us.

That's what this whole thing has been about since the beginning 这才是从一开始我们就想实现的
and that is absolutely how it is going to end.

Together, us united.

Bloody hell.

I can't believe you're here.

I can't believe you're here.

Where are my lesbians?

- Hi.

Hi!

These are all cucumber.

- I can't believe you came.

We love a bloody good march.

Right, where do you want us?

- You lot.

There's too many of you.

What?

You'll have to go to the front.

- We're not losing our banners, mate.

What's he mean, too many?

What's he on about?

I think he means them.

Caerphilly.

East glamorgan.

Aberdare lodge.

Bargoed surface lodge.

Fernhill lodge.

Blygrathc lodge.

Ferniside plant.

Dulais valley lodge, onllwyn, 杜莱思谷分会
and haverford west lodge.

South wales num headquarters.

The gays and lesbians have been absolutely magnificent 男女同性恋们绝对的无以伦比
there's no other word for it.

You must have found it a bit weird.

A load of gays and lesbians descending on you like that?

Why on earth would we have found that weird?

This way, guys.

Come on, guys.

Not worried about being too visible this time?

Shut up and march.
