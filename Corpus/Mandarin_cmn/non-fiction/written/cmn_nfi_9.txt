我叫沃特·奥布莱恩 My name is Walter O'Brien.
我有史上第四高的智商 197 I have the fourth highest IQ ever recorded:

爱因斯坦只有160 Einstein's was 160.
11岁时 我因入侵宇航局而被联调局逮捕 When I was 11, the FBI arrested me for hacking NASA
而我只是想找蓝图贴在卧室墙上而已 to get their blueprints for my bedroom wall.
现在我带领一组天才 Now I run a team of geniuses,
解决只有我们能应对的全球范围危机 tackling worldwide threats only we can solve.
托比是我们的行为分析专家 Toby's our behaviorist.

乐乐
乐乐 机械天才 Happy, a mechanical prodigy.
乐乐
格洛探员
凯布·格洛探员是政府监管人 Agent Cabe Gallo's our government handler.
格洛探员
佩吉
还有佩吉 And Paige?
佩吉跟我们不是一类人 Well, Paige isn't like us.
她是正常人 She's normal
她为我们解释这个世界 and translates the world for us
我们帮她理解她的天才儿子 while we help her understand her genius son.
我们是天蝎 Together, we are Scorpion.
我觉得我们该往东走 Think we should go east.
那是西边 That's west.
那我们也还是该往那边走 Well, still should go that way.
为什么啊 Yeah?

这都怪你 This is your fault!
你非得带我们走小路 You had to take us off the trail.
你非得去看什么瀑布 You had to see that damn waterfall!
我以为我认识路啊 I thought I knew where I was going.
那有个屁用 Oh, well, a lot of good that does us now, huh?
已经一天半没水 没食物 没信号了 Day and a half with no water, food or cell reception.
孩子们都吓坏了 And the kids are terrified.
你俩只是在帮倒忙 And you two aren't helping.
我们继续走吧 Let's just keep moving
试着找到大路 and try to get back to a road.
我们会带你们出去的 我保证 We'll get you out of here.

圣安娜飓风好厉害 Winds of Santa Ana.
既有下风也有上风 She's a

这是水手的行话 That is sailor talk.
其实 这些词 Actually, those terms just relate
只和人与风向的相对位置有关 to one's position to the wind.
并不是航行专用 It's not exclusive to sailing.
事实上 我要给你看看 In fact, I'm about to show you
怎么把风向用于飞行 how it applies to aeronautics.
说赌什么 State the wager.
沿电话线 近地平飞 Down the telephone wires, straighten at ground level,
穿过街道 进入那扇窗户 then across the street and through that window.
赌 我赢了 晚餐约会 You're on.

你赢 我给你洗一个月的衣服 If you win, I do your laundry for a month.
你个变态 大概更想要洗衣服吧 You'd probably like that more than the dinner, perv.
希腊菜吧 德州

因为卡车 打赌无效 The bet is null and void on account of that truck.
你说能飞进窗户 You said you'd get it in the window,
但没进去 and it ain't in the window.
我才是赌博的行家 I'm the gambling expert.
我们要约会 We be datin'.
太好了 咖啡煮好了 Ooh, great.

给 Yes.
正好 Perfect.
谢了 沃特 Thanks, Walter.
沃特 过来聊聊 Walter, a minute of your time.
好棒 Yeah.

这是什么啊 Oh.

外联 This is outreach.
你也知道 德鲁很快要从波特兰回来了 Now, as you know, Drew comes back from Portland soon.
他自信满满 牛逼闪闪地回来 He's gonna come back full of confidence and swagger.
那些大运动员都想要什么呢 And what did those alpha

拉拉队员 The cheerleader.
也就是佩吉·狄宁 AKA Paige Dineen.
佩吉的私生活跟我什么关系 Why is Paige's personal life my concern?
就在这里 我一直在收集数据 Right here is why.

关于你这几个月情绪变化的规律 on your shifting behavior patterns the past few months,
其结果毫无疑问地显示 and the result is an iron

你对佩吉有感情 that proves you have feelings for Paige.
简直荒谬 That's preposterous.
面对科学证据 Said the climate

还拒不承认 in the face of scientific evidence.
顺便扎一剂否认的疫苗吧 While you're at it, how 'bout you get no vaccines today?
要听听吗 You want to take this for a spin?
记得你情人节 Remember the reservation you made
预定的"工作晚餐"吗 for a Valentine's Day "work dinner"?
但我们最终没吃成 We never ended up having the meal.
好吧 Okay.
你办公室的新薰衣草熏香呢 How about the new lavender diffuser in your office?
那是为了掩盖实验产生的鼠尿味儿 That is to mask the smell of experiment

恶心 That's disgusting.
但也是谎言 But also a lie.
佩吉喜欢薰衣草 Paige loves lavender.
她的手霜总把面包车搞得一车的味儿 That hand cream of hers is always stinking up the van.
最后 Finally...
肉桂咖啡
阿拉伯咖啡 ...Coffea arabica.
你以为我为什么跑出去买咖啡 Why do you think I've been getting my joe at Kovelski's?
因为你往我们的咖啡壶里放了肉桂 Because you put cinnamon in our pot here.
肉桂含抗氧化剂 增强脑力 It has antioxidants and improves brain function.
精灵才喝肉桂呢 Cinnamon's for elves.
你往咖啡里放肉桂 You put cinnamon in the coffee
是因为她喜欢 because she likes it.
他在给她特殊待遇 You're giving her special treatment,
所以只有一种可能 which can only mean...
你多大了 And how old are you?
比你大13个月 13 months older than you,
尊重长者吧 so show your elders respect.
这...

你最近为什么总揪着 What is with the almost constantly commenting
我和佩吉不放啊 on me and Paige lately?
简直近乎执迷 It's borderline obsessive.
作为人类行为的研究者 As a student of human behavior,
我认为情感上不诚实很过分 I find emotional dishonesty offensive.
而且 你是我朋友 And also, you're my friend.
而且 我不喜欢德鲁 Also, I don't like Drew.
别以为你就没事了 You're not saved by the bell.
凯布 Yeah, Cabe.
有案子 急事 Got a case, urgent.
六个教堂团体的驴友 We got six hikers from a church group
在洛杉矶国家森林里走失了 lost in Los Angeles National Forest.
已经失踪36小时了 Been missing for 36 hours.
圣安娜飓风卷起了森林的尘土 能见度很低 Santa Ana winds are kicking up the forest floor, killing visibility.
搜救几乎无法展开 Search and rescue is damn near impossible.
洛杉矶消防部和林务局需要帮助 LAFD and the Forest Service need an assist.
我在考虑当年巴格达行动中 I was thinking your tracking software
用到的你的追踪软件 from the Baghdad operation years back

或许把那个翻出来吧 maybe dusting that off.
我们通话之后风力更大了 Winds have gotten worse since we spoke.
没时间浪费了 We don't have any time to waste.
这是驴友的家属吧 Must be the hikers' families.
还有教堂的教友 Alongside members of their church.
我的系统用摄像头和激光扫描器 My system uses a camera and laser scanners
进行高级地面成像 to conduct advanced ground imaging
可以穿透树木遮挡 that can penetrate tree cover
在高纬度辨识地表情况 and recognize ground patterns at high altitudes.
总之 我们的东西能看清楚 Basically, our stuff sees good.
你是为找乐子做的这个吗 You built this for fun?
这么说吧 Well, let's just say I, uh...
我改进了一个很旧的系统 I modified an old system from way back.
我的人会找到那些驴友 My guys will locate the hikers,
用无线电通知你们坐标 然后救援队施救 radio in the coordinates;

我们需要看看你们的人到目前的收获 We need to see whatever your people have done so far.
用我的巴格达软件做这个真有意思 It's an interesting use of my Baghdad software.
你怎么想到用到这事上的 How did you think to apply it to this situation?
事实上 The truth is,
我经常想起巴格达的事 I think about what happened in Baghdad a lot.
以及我们之间的事 what happened between us.
也许你的发明 Maybe your tech

可以做一些好事 some good can come from it now.
沃特 过来看看这个 Walter, you got to see this.
有个孩子在去登山前 One of the kids tweeted a picture
发了张照片 right before they went on the hike.
之后他们的手机就没信号了 They've been out of cell range ever since.
有这个 我们就找得到他们了 Well, that's all we need to find the hikers.
怎么找 How?
你一直在找他们在哪里 You've been looking for where the hikers are.
那只是针对于某时某刻的瞬时位置罢了 That's one specific place in a specific moment in time,
这个位置在不断变化 and it's constantly moving.
但是孩子们的脚印 The footprints, however,
即使在这样的强风里也能保留几个小时 they can last for hours, even in this wind,
根据这些可以找到他们走的路线 and they could be a road map right to them.
分离好了吗 Breakdown?
所以这些脚印是孩子们的帆布鞋留下的 Okay, so these treads are the kids' sneakers.
有两双是条状的 Two are piece

另一双是交叉花纹的 other is a cross

估计一下鞋码 两双9号男鞋 Approximate sizes:

一双6号女鞋 and a girls' six.
大人们穿的是登山靴 The adults are wearing hiking boots
鞋底是华夫饼格子图案 with standard waffle patterns,
而且那个女人的外侧鞋跟有破损 and the woman's got an outside heel break.
扫描图像 Scan the images.
男的一个会在前面 另一个在最后 One of the men will be in front, one of them in back.
这是标准的防御阵型 这是动物本能 It's standard defense formation, wired into animal DNA

说不定他们自己都没意识到 they don't even know they're doing it.
那个女人应该是带着最小的那个女孩 That woman will most likely be with the youngest girl
母亲保护孩子的天性

你看这个 If you look at the, uh,
这两个人搂搂抱抱的 肯定是情侣 body language of these two youngsters here, they're in love.
他们肩靠着肩 They're side by side.
一张照片你就看得出来他们是情侣吗 You can tell they're in love just from the photo?
很多线索我都看得出 Oh, I can tell lots of ways.
其他人在这个阵型里头 The others will follow standard pack formation
在这里和这里 and fall in here and here.
我们尽量找这种形状的脚印 We'll be looking for a shape like this
跟踪他们留下的痕迹 filled with tread patterns
这样就可以和野生动物 that we can distinguish from mountain lion drag marks,
以及风化痕迹区分开来 windswept debris.
就可以找到他们 That'll let us find our folks.
我们的工作站在哪 Uh, where's our workstation?
等一下 等一下 No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
别这样 别这样 no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
沃特 我不想坐那东西 Walter, I am not going up in that thing.
直升机没有机翼 不遵循帕斯卡原理 Helicopters have zero aerodynamics
引擎一旦失效全玩完 and no glide ability in case of engine failure.
我们没别的飞机 That's our only choice.
这就是个悬在空中的盒子 It's a box held up in the sky
顶着个剪草机刀片 我不坐 by a lawnmower blade.

那就拉着别人的手吧 Hope you're up for a little handholding today.
斯莱 我们需要你 Sly, we need you.
你计算数据的速度最快 No one can run the analytics as fast as you can.
沃特 我也想帮忙 Walter, I want to help,
但是我不能就这样走进 but I can't willingly board a death trap
达芬奇五百年前设计的死亡陷阱 designed by Leonardo da Vinci 500 years ago.
那就留在这里吧 Then stay here!
因为我最见不得哭哭啼啼的人 'Cause I got a strict no

这是你们的飞行员 马克斯·布朗森 Meet your pilot, Marcus Bronson.
不想一起去 就别去 Look, you don't want to come, don't come,
但你一旦登机 but once you get on board,
就给我坚强点 听见没有 you need keep it together, you understand?
飞直升机是很严肃的事 It's serious business up there.
谁都不能在我飞机上乱了阵脚 I can't have anyone freaking out in my bird.
什么叫我们的飞行员 你不一起去吗 Hey, what'd you mean, our pilot?

机舱里坐不下 There's no room in the cabin.
所以我在后方支援 跟救援队合作 So I'll stay back and gear up with the rescue team.
你们一发来地址 我们就出发 Once you send in the hikers' locations, we go in.
这是卫星电话 This is a SAT phone.
手机没信号的时候也能用 Works where the cell phones don't.
随身带好 这是救命的东西 Keep it close to you.

小心点 Hey!
要是划伤了 就得付钱 You scratch it, you buy it.
挺幽默 He's fun.
你还好吗 Are you good?
好吧 Sure.
那就出发吧 Okay.

好 Okay.
我们知道您有机会选择其他航班 We know you have a lot of choices when you fly,
因此感谢您选择天蝎航空出行 so we want to thank you for flying with Air Scorpion.
别废话了 Please, no unnecessary words.
要是肥仔吐了 你们要给我清干净 Big guy barfs, you guys are cleaning it up.
不会有事的 Everything's going to be fine.
只看你的电脑屏幕 不要往外看 Just look at your laptop and avoid peripheral vision, okay?
预测模型显示 Now, our predictive model
他们从西南方向下山了 says they headed downhill west

概率为94% with a statistical likelihood of 94%,
请往西走 so bank west here.
有结果了 I got a hit.
乐乐 看得到吗 Happy, you seeing this?
找到匹配结果
看得到 Yup.
脚印符合我们要找的人 The treads match our hikers.
这个图形说明 The formation they're walking in
他们正在按我的预想前进 is spot on with my prediction.
好 飞行员 坚持当前航线 Okay, pilot, stay the current course
我们继续追踪 while we close in on them.
没出什么事吧 Everything okay?
风速达到50航节 Wind's up to 50 knots.
会有颠簸 请抓紧 It's gonna get bumpy.

凯布 听得到吗 Cabe, do you copy?
听得到 沃特 Copy, Walter.
好消息 It's good news.
我们找到了他们的脚印 We found the hikers' trail.
几分钟内 就能找到他们 Within minutes, we find them.
很好 你们目前在哪里 That's great work.

机长先生 这里是哪里 Hey, Captain Charisma, where are we?
该死的 Damn it!
出现了风切变 抓紧 Wind shear!

基地 我是飞鹰号 是否收到 Base, this is Eagle!

收到 我们收得到 Copy.

能听到吗 能听到吗 Do you read?

有仪器出现了状况 We have equipment fail...
强风破坏了通讯工具 Wind's wreaking havoc on the comms.
沃特 沃特 收得到吗 Walter!

我们要死了 We're gonna die!
死不了 No one's gonna die.
求救 Mayday!
基地 我是飞鹰号 我们出事了 Base, this is Eagle!

重复 我们出事了 Repeat

我们要撞到树上了 We're heading right for those trees!
别别别 No, no, no, no, no!
远离松树 You steer away from the pines!
朝澳洲麻黄橡木那飞 Aim for that!

木质更软 我们有更大的生存几率 It's softer!

沃特 152米 121米 Walter, 500 feet!

相信我 照我说的做 往那飞 You got to trust me!

-天呐

该死的你在干什么 What the hell are you doing?

抱头屈身 抱头屈身 Heads down!

大家坐稳了 我们要迫降了 Everybody, hold on!

我的十二指肠 My duodenum.
大家都还好吗 Everyone all right?
我没事 I'm okay.
没事 Check.
吓破了胆 但还没断气 Terrified, but breathing.
听着 Okay.
注意我们的体重分布 Watch our weight distribution
不然树枝折了我们就该摔死了 or the bow breaks and this cradle falls.
你还好吗 哥们 You okay, boss?
不太乐观 I've been better.
伤势如何 How bad?
血色鲜亮 Uh, bright blood,
大腿左外侧 outer left side of the thigh.
应该是割破了股动脉 Looks like he nicked the femoral artery,
但血凝结了 伤势稳定 but it's clotted off, stabilized.
你怎么知道 How would you know that?
如果没凝结 你就该死了 If it hadn't, you'd be dead.
但伤口可能会扩大 But that cut could expand.
得把金属片留在伤口里 We need to leave the metal in.
找个止血带 我们下去后 You do a tourniquet, and I'll clean it up
我再给你清理伤口 when we get on the ground.
我们得尽快送你去医院 We need to get you to a hospital ASAP.
这理论不错 但我们正挂在12米高的树上 Great in theory, but we are 40

而且通讯器都失灵了 And our comms are dead.
我怀疑他们连我们迫降的位置都定位不了 I doubt they got a location on our crash site.
我能解决这问题 I can take care of that,
但我需要大家割开安全带 but I'm gonna need everyone to cut off their seatbelts.
斯莱 计算一下可行方案 Sly, I need you to do some math for me.
好的 根据树木的角度 Okay, based on the angle of the tree
以及我们的重量分布 and the weight distribution, uh,
根据我们的重心平衡点 estimated by the barycenter balancing point,
以及河麻黄橡木的湿抗张强度 as well as the relatively weak tensile strength of
这强度堪比草根 the River Sheoak, which is really no more than a weed...
-集中注意力

底线是 我们得有战略性地移开重量 Bottom line is we need to remove the weight strategically,
否则我们都得翻下去 or we're all going to topple over...
就跟那堆积木游戏一样 like Don't Tip the Waiter.
最佳方案 先是乐乐 然后我 然后托比 So, best guess is Happy, then me, then Toby,
然后马克斯得减轻机头的重量 then Marcus needs to take some weight off the nose,
接着是沃特 then Walter,
最后是佩吉 and then lastly Paige,
因为机舱的重量置换较小 because the weight displacement in the cabin is less.
乐乐 Happy,
交给你了 make it happen.
我们没事 We're fine!
一切都相安无事 Everything's fine.
我下去的时候 机身会摇晃 When I go down, this thing is gonna shake.
大家都坐稳了 Just keep your heads straight.
应该不会有事 We should be good.
"应该" 太棒了 "Should." Fantastic.
下来了 Made it!
该你了 希尔维斯特 You're up, Sylvester!
知道吗 You know what?
我想我的计算出错了 乐乐 I think my calculations were off, Happy!
我应该最后一个下去 I should go last!
不 你的计算很正确 No, your calculations were perfect,
这树枝可支撑不了太久 and this thing's not gonna hold much longer, okay?
所以赶紧下去 So you go now.
你会没事的 斯莱 You're gonna be fine, Sly.
好吧 Okay.
-想点开心的事

天呐 Geez.
我的天 Oh, my God.
加油 你能做到 Come on!

不不不不不 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
我的天 我的天 Oh, my God.

我不能再往下了 I can't go any further!
我不能...

伸直双腿 Just straighten your legs.
伙计们 加快速度 Hurry, guys!
机身的震动要压裂支撑的树枝了 All this movement is cracking the support branches!
好了 该你了 Okay, you're up.
希尔维斯特说我最后走 Sylvester said I go last.
你现在就下去 You're going.

不不 我们得照希尔维斯特说的做 No.

不 你快下去 No, you go.
马上下去 Now.

下去 Go!
我的天呐 Oh, my God.
好吧 Okay.
这顺序不对 这顺序不对 That's the wrong order!

沃特 你最好麻利点 Hey, Walt, you better hustle!
沃特 那直升飞机几秒后就会自由落体 Walter, you've got seconds until that helicopter is in free fall!
支撑树枝要断了 The support branches are breaking!
-沃特

看来一切都跟计划有出入 Looks as if things haven't gone according to plan.
我们用卫星电话报告位置 We call in our location on the SAT phone,
凯布找到我们后再重新部署 Cabe gets us, we regroup.
这电话估计是收不到信号了 We might not get the reception we're looking for on this model.
我得在伤口上绑紧止血带 I have to tighten the tourniquet almost on top of the wound;
会很疼 it's gonna hurt.
我想我俩对疼痛的定义不同 I think you and I have different definitions of pain.
好吧 我们迫降在这 Okay.

照这样的树木覆盖情况 And with the tree cover,
直升飞机既不能降落也不能拉我们上去 there's no way a chopper can land or airlift us out.
唯一合适的撤退点在这 Only suitable evac point is here.
提琴手盆地 在正东方向 It's Fiddler's Basin;

是那边 It's that way.
你怎么知道在那边 How do you know that?
把时针指向太阳 I point the hour hand at the sun,
把指针及12点方向二等分找到正南 I bisect the angle between the hand and the 12 to find south.
找到正南方向 其他方向也就出来了 I know south, I know every other direction.
好吧 现在...

我们联系不上凯布 we can't contact Cabe,
但我们得假定他和我们想法相同 but we have to assume that he's thinking like us
知道提琴手盆地是唯一的可行撤退点 and he knows that Fiddler's Basin is our only shot.
我们跟着远足者的脚印 So, we follow the hikers' footprints.
找到他们后 派地上部队回来 We find them, and then we send an overground rescue team back
接希尔维斯特和飞行员 for Sylvester and the pilot.
等等 等等 等等 Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
你要把我和他留在这 不行 You're leaving me here with him?

你走不动 托比得跟我们走 You can't walk.

以防远足者中有伤员 just in case there are any injured hikers.
我不喜欢这计划 I do not like this plan.
我们在荒芜人烟的树林里 We're in desolate woods

没吃的 缺水 还没有通讯工具 no food, limited water and no comms.
那等我们走了 你们可以修一修无线电 Right.

我们都知道如果卫星电话还能用 Well, we're well aware things would be easier
事情会容易得多 但现实并非如此 if we still had that SAT phone, but that is not the case.
你为什么对我冷嘲热讽的 What was with the swipe at me?
要是你刚才抓住了卫星电话 Well, if you had been holding on
而不是抱住我 to the SAT phone instead of me,
我们现在就不用这么艰难了 we would never be in this mess right now.
我那是在保护你 是本能反应 I was protecting you.

是愚蠢 It was stupid.
你是个没系安全带 重达68公斤的抛射体 You were an unbuckled, 150

70公斤 我最近有锻炼呢 154

咱们出发吧 Let's get moving!
再过47分钟太阳就落山了 Sun sets in 47 minutes.
好吧 那我就和这个臭脾气的家伙 Okay, so...

待在这树林里 with the grumpy guy.
别抱怨了 快去修无线电 Hey, stop your bellyaching, go fix that radio.
去啊 Go on!
长官 我们在一棵折断的树冠上 Sir, we spotted the chopper's tail
发现了直升机的机尾 through a break in the tree canopy.
遮挡太厚了 Cover's too thick.
无法判断是否有人生还 Can't make out any survivors.
-给我看看地形图

如果他们活着 你觉得他们 If they survive, you think they'll try
会继续完成任务吗 to keep with the mission?
这不是假设 There's no "If."
我的人肯定活着 My guys survived.
这里 提琴手盆地 Here, Fiddler's Basin.
唯一可供撤离的区域 Only viable evac point.
距离坠机地点4.

风这么大不可能 Not in this wind.
55节的风速 根本没办法着陆 At 55 knots, everything is grounded.
运输直升机可以做到 Transport helo can handle it.
可这里根本没有 County doesn't have one.
那我就去联系彭德尔顿那边 Then I'm reaching out to Pendleton.
我不会把我的人扔下的 There's no way I'm leaving my guys down there!
登山客们 我们来救你们了 Hikers, we're here to rescue you!
根据这些脚印 So, based on the prints,
其中一人重心在右脚 one of them is favoring the right foot,
左脚几乎是拖着在走 这人可能受伤了 partly dragging the other;

对 这是6码的鞋 鞋印很浅 Yeah, that's a size six shoe with a shallow depression.
应该是凯特琳 她最轻 That's Caitlin, the lightest.
如果她受伤了 If she's hurt,
他们应该走得不快 they can't be traveling that fast.
我们会找到他们的 We will find them.
对了 Oh, by the way, uh,
他们果真跟你预测的脚印图案一样 they really stuck to that cluster pattern you predicted.
你说得真是对极了 You were right on the money.
我的大多数行为预测都是对的 Most of my behavioral predictions turn out to be true.
比如 你之前在直升机里做的事 For instance, what you did for Paige up in the copter.

让她先下来 为了她自己承担风险 Letting her go first, putting yourself at risk for her.
我没有给佩吉特殊待遇 I was not giving Paige special treatment.
你差点被掉下来的飞机砸成馅饼 I watched you almost get pancaked by a falling aircraft.
你不顾希尔维斯特的计算 You ignored Sylvester's calculations

忽略了数学和科学 只为了让她先到地面 math and science

咱们能专心找那些孩子们吗 Can we focus on finding the hikers?
-当然

能给我点水吗 May I have some of water?
好 Oh, yeah.
按之前同意的量 The...

跟其他人一样 Same as everyone else gets.
我们都平等 We're all equal.
谢谢 Thank you.
真是生动的一课啊 老板 Wow, you really learned me there, boss.
你显然不喜欢她 You clearly don't like her.
伙计们 我们有麻烦了 Guys, we got a problem!
登山的路到这里就没了 The trail ends here.
登山客们穿过那片平地 The hikers crossed this field.
他们可能从任何地方进入林子 They could've entered up those woods at any point,
可能往任何方向走 headed in any direction.
我们不可能找到他们了 We have no way of finding them now.
等等 别出声 Wait, shh, shh, shh.
在那边 Over there.
你怎么知道 How do you know?
原因很科学 我听见声音了 It's very scientific.

那些孩子没法继续走了 These kids can't go much further.
不如我们分开 Maybe we split

能增加我们获救的概率 increase the odds of some of us getting rescued.
可能吧 Yeah, maybe.
不知道 I don't know.
我不知道该怎么办了 I don't know what to do.
听说你们迷路了 Heard you guys are lost.
谢天谢地 Oh, thank God.
-谢谢你

为什么每次都是他被抱 我明明就站在他旁边 How come he always gets the hug?

你们是林务局的吗 Are you guys with the Forestry Service?
不 我们是政府派来的 No, no.

来带你们回家 we're here to bring you home.
怎么回 How?
我们先去附近的一块空地 Well, we're gonna take you to a nearby clearing;
会有人在那里接我们 there are people who will meet us there.
走吧 Okay, let's go.
托比 你能去看看那个受伤的姑娘吗 Toby, can you check on the girl with the hurt leg?
我给他们喝点水 Let me get them some water.
好了 走吧 孩子 Okay, let's go, kid.
这是什么 What is this?
我爱收集石头 I collect rocks.
里面有方硼石 These have boracite in them.
我要把它们带回家 I'm bringing them home with me.
不行了 Not anymore you're not.
我们还要走很远 不能有额外的重量 We're hiking for miles

好吧 就带一块 Okay, one rock.
都准备好了吗 Okay, are we ready?
好了吗 Yeah?
走吧 Okay, let's go.
托比 Toby?
你要把那些输入导线的外皮剥掉 Okay, you need to strip those input wires.
可我没有剥皮钳啊 I don't have any wire strippers.
就用你的牙和指甲 Just use your teeth and your fingernails.
这太不卫生了 This is incredibly unsanitary.
不卫生 有没有搞错 Unsanitary?

我在你这么大时 I ate grubs and worms for five days
有一次军事训练 我吃了五天昆虫 on a military exercise when I was your age.
-真好

因为我学会了迫不得已时要不顾一切 because I learned to do what needs to be done.
-收到 请说

喂 Hello?
天呐 你听到了吗 Oh, my God, you hear that?

别跟我说 跟他们说 跟他们说 Don't talk to me, talk to them!

喂 能听到吗 喂 Hello, do you copy?

请回答 Come in, please.
有人吗 请回答 Hello?

拜托 拜托 拜托 Come on, come on, come on.
对不起 I'm sorry.
怎么了 What?
你不打算说些什么吗 You're not gonna say anything?
我已经说了对不起 I already said I'm sorry.
好吧 Okay.
我明白了 我明白了 I get it.

也许我得吃一嘴甲虫幼虫 Maybe if I rewired the entire radio
然后修好无线电 with my mouth full of beetle larvae,
才能让你满意 maybe then I would have done a better job for you.
小子 小子 快看 Kid, kid, look, look.
不要啊 Oh, no.
你闻到了烟味吗 You smell smoke?
一定是哪里起火了 There must be a fire somewhere.
那是一块灰烬吗 Is that an ember?
差点就要烧起来了 Ah, that was close.
沃特 Um, Walter.
怎么了 Yeah?
天呐 Oh, boy.
你得抓紧时间 孩子 You need to hurry up, kid!
我很清楚 林火会以每秒6.

林火正在包围我们 Fire's circling around us.
一旦火圈完全合拢 我们就要被烧死了 That loop closes, then we're cooked, literally.
好了 我再检查一个安全带就好了 Okay, I just need to secure one more seat belt.
好吧 All right.
你可以把这个背在背上吗 And you're okay to land this thing on your back?
-当然可以了

扶住我的手臂 扶住我的手臂 Hey, take my arm, take my arm, okay?
你腿上的血流得更多了 Your leg has a lot more blood on it.
-你没事吧

你把我扶过去就好 Just get me on there.
慢点 慢点 Easy, easy.
把你自己绑起来 Strap yourself in there.
你确定这能承受得了吗 You sure this is gonna hold?
它只需要承受五千米的路程 It only needs to hold us for three miles
等我们到达提琴手盆地 until Fiddler's Basin.
你朋友把地图带走了 你记得怎么走吗 Your friends took the map.

我有照相式记忆能力 I have a photographic memory.
当然了 我们走吧 Of course you do.

走吧 Let's go!
我的眼睛很烫 My eyes are burning.
呼吸也越来越困难了 It's getting hard to breathe.
好吧 等等 Okay, hold on.
你能把那个拿出来吗 Will you grab that out?
把那个拿出来 Grab that.
好了 把那个盖在鼻子和嘴巴上 Okay, now hold that up to your nose and mouth.
给你 Here you go.
你干什么 What the hell are you doing?
我在帮你啊 I'm helping you,
当时在直升机上我也是试图帮你 like I was trying to on the helicopter.
就这么简单 只是帮忙而已 That's all, just help.
我不需要有人来照顾我 I do not need someone to take care of me.
你吻了我 You kissed me.
而如今我就是在对此作出回应 And now that I'm responding to that,
你害怕了 封闭自我 you're scared and shutting down.
我被大火包围了 I am surrounded by fire.
有小孩等着我们救 We have kids to save,
我们还要自救 not to mention ourselves.
现在不是时候 Not the time.
怎么了 What's up?
你自己看吧 See for yourself.
现在怎么办 What now?
一定有路绕过去的 There's got to be a way around.
我们得从侧面绕 We'd be moving laterally
因为火是从这个方向来的 as the fire proceeds in this way.
假如我们选错了方向 那么...

我们就死定了 We're dead.
你说我们还剩多少时间 How long would you say we have?
大约十分钟 We've got about ten minutes.
我们得穿过去了 We've got to get across.
开始搜寻能承受我们重量的长枝 Start looking for long branches strong enough to hold us.
也许我们把它们绑在一起 Maybe we, uh, we bind them together,
就能穿过去了 then we reach across.
兄弟 那听上去像是自杀啊 Oh, bro, that sounds like suicide.
留在这里才是自杀 Staying here is suicide.
来吧 快找吧 Come on, start looking.
沃特 对不起 这都怪我 Walter, I'm sorry, this is all my fault.
林火不是你点燃的 You didn't start the wildfire.
我把大家带离了小路 让大家迷路了 I took everyone off the trail, got everyone lost,
我只是想给珍娜找个完美的地方 all because I wanted to find the perfect spot for Jenna,
向她求婚 to propose to her.
而如今她却要死了 大家都要死了 And now she's gonna die, everyone,
就因为我 because of me.
你想要弥补这一切吗 You want to undo that?
帮我们下到那个峡谷里 Help us get over that ravine.
好吗 All right?
她在干什么 What's she doing?
你们有人试过高空绳索摆荡吗 Any of you guys ever rope

我喘不上气了 I

是因为浓烟的缘故 It's on account of the smoke.
你得挺过去 孩子 You got to push through it, kid,
因为我看见一簇火焰从那个小山坡上 'cause I'm looking at a blaze coming over that hill
直冲我们而来了 right toward us.
火势蔓延的速度比我快 我跑不过它的 It's faster than I am.

放屁 Like hell you can't!
鼓起劲来 快走 Now get your ass in gear now!

别冲我吼 Don't yell at me.
我快要被烧死了 I'm about to burn to death!
拿出点勇气来 小子 快走 Now grow a pair, son, and Oscar Mike now!
别说了 Stop.
军人式的说话方式和呵斥对我不起作用 Military talk and berating won't work with me.
从来没起过作用 It never has.
我已经算过了 I have done the calculations!
我最快的速度 这个山坡的斜率 My fastest rate of speed, the decline angle of this hill,
火势蔓延的速度 下层林丛的干燥程度 the pace of the fire, the dryness of the underbrush

就算是瞪羚几分钟之内也会被包围了 a gazelle would be taken in minutes.
而我们只有几秒钟 You and I have seconds!
孩子 Son,
什么也不做 doing nothing
也不是正确选择 isn't an option for either of us.
听我说 Listen to me.
我们得想个办法做到比火快 We got to figure a way to move faster than this fire,
不然我俩都得死 or we're both dead.
你明白了吗 Do you understand?
我们不可能比火快 We can't,
但也许我们不必比火快 but we may not need to.
好了 至少绑紧了 Okay, at least the hold is secure.
但我不禁注意到你还没有荡出去 Can't help but notice you haven't swung out yet.
是啊 关于这一点...

这棵树的内部可能已经完全腐烂了 this tree could totally be rotted out inside.
一个人的重量可能会把它折成两半 A person's weight could snap it in half.
-是的 然后摔15米摔死

我们必须做点什么 林火越来越近了 We've got to do something;

除非有人自愿当小白鼠 Well, unless we got a human guinea pig
愿意亲自试试...

撑得住 It'll hold.
越来越近了 It's getting closer.
-咱们得快点行动

咱们走 Let's go!
好的 Okay.
这边 Here.
你确定吗 Are you sure about this?
没错 这边 小心 Yes.

谢谢 Thanks.
-我们会被烤熟的

这个门是钛制的 导热性特别差 The door's made of titanium;

你最好别说错 孩子 You better be right, kid.
天呐 Oh, my God!
趴下趴下 Get down!

等等等等 Hold on, hold on, hold on.
小心你的腿 小心你的腿 Careful with your leg.

好的 Okay.
你没事吧 You okay?
还有气 Breathing.
勉强 Barely.
伙计 你的腿失血太多了 Oh, man, your leg's losing a lot of blood.
我得把止血带再系紧点 I have to tighten your tourniquet.
系到最紧吧 Do your worst.
这样应该能稍微撑一会 That should hold it for a bit.
谢谢 Thanks.
我很佩服你 紧急之中还能想到 I got to hand it to you, that was quick thinking
躲起来走 with the pipe.
我们得继续 We got to move.
这扇门已经被高温摧毁了 This door has been warped by the heat.
我觉得我能修好 I think I can fix it.
用这个 Use this.
谢谢 Thank you.
我想你爸爸应该出身军队吧 So I take it your dad was military?
不折不扣 Very.
你们俩关系不好吗 You guys didn't get along too well?
在我父亲的世界中 Well, my father comes from a world
对人的评判标准是 where a man is measured by
高中橄榄球赛中摔倒了多少名对手 how many tackles he made in high school
或者能用脑袋砸烂多少罐啤酒 or how many beer cans he can crush against his skull.
和你的世界一样 Same world that you come from.
好了 再走个四百米 咱们往右转 Okay, guys, about a quarter mile, we dogleg right,
到那咱们就能安心了 then it's a straight shot from there.
大概有150米 难度系数很低 About, uh, 500 feet, five percent grade.
托比 Okay, Toby?
-跟上 好的

咱们得快点到那块空地 guys, got to make it to the clearing.
分配一下饮用水吧 能多撑一会 Let's start rationing out the water

你可以喝我的 You can take my share if you want.
不 你比任何人都需要水 No.

还是谢了 Thank you though.
沃特 过来 盆地就在这个拐弯处 Walter, get down here!

只有这么一条路 This is the only way through.
这道沟引发了漏斗效应 This gully is creating a funnel effect
让火焰都聚在了一起 that's pulling the fires together.
-我们得快点了

来吧 来吧 伙计们 Come on.

你们也听到了 You heard her.
快点 Come on!
快点 就快到了 Hurry, the wall's closing!
你没事的 没事的 You're okay.

沃特 Walter!
沃特 Walter!
吉米 你没事吧 Jimmy, you're okay!
-我没事 没事

总不想被活活烧死吧 You don't want to burn out.
太快了吗 Too soon?
伙计们 火势马上就要 Guys, the fire's gonna fill up the clearing
蔓延到空地上了 before we know it.
咱们得走了 这边走 快点 We got to move.

等等 等等 Hold up!

走不动了 We're stuck.
好吧 All right.
住手 住手 Stop, stop, stop.
你的这个装置没用 This contraption of yours isn't going anywhere.
好吧 Okay.
让我看看 能不能修好 Give me a second.

不不 No, no.
不用了 不用了 Stop.

我是累赘 Look, I'm dead weight.
你走得精疲力尽 我们没水了 You're dead on your feet.

你都抽筋了 You're cramping up.
按这种速度 咱们连两百米 At this rate, we're not gonna go
都走不到 更别提要走个1700米了 another ten inches, let alone another mile.
我不会丢下你的 I'm not going to abandon you.
这轮不到你来决定 It's not your call.
这片林子里全是烟尘 This gully is filling up with smoke.
氧气很快就会所剩无几 There will not be enough oxygen left.
如果我丢下了你 你会死的 If I leave you, you will die.
如果你留下 咱们都得死 We both die if you stay.
你在干什么 What are you doing?
我在救你的命 孩子 去吧 I'm saving your life, son.

走吧 Go.
我们刚到坠毁现场 We're coming up on the crash site.
开启照明 Light it up!
抱歉 探员 I'm sorry, Agent.
就算是空降兵 也不可能 Staying ahead of this fire, even for smoke jumpers,
躲开这场大火 would be damn near impossible.
带我们去提琴手盆地 Take us to Fiddler's Basin.
咱们会径直穿过大火 We'll be flying right into the fire front.
可见度几乎低到零 Visibility will be low to nil.
在直升机上我没看到有尸体 I don't see any bodies by the chopper.
我的人都很坚强 Now, my guys are survivors.
不要让我说第二遍 Don't make me ask again.
咱们去盆地 Let's head to the basin.
我们没法到盆地的 We can't make it to the basin.
我们也不能回头 We can't go back.
天呐 我们被困住了 Oh, my God.

等等 等等 Hold on, hold on, hold on.
听 听 Listen.

直升机 A helicopter.
是凯布 It's Cabe.
这么大烟 他们不可能看到我们 They're never gonna see us through the smoke.
手电筒 手电筒 Flashlights.

我没看到人 I don't see anybody.
-你呢

往西蔓延的火势 That fire line to the west
阻断了盆地的通路 is cutting off any route into that basin.
不管他们在哪 Wherever they are,
他们不可能到得了空地 they are not making it to the clearing.
长官 烟灰会堵住引擎 Sir, soot can choke our engine.
老实说 真没必要 Respectfully, there is no point
让我们也赔上命 in all of us dying.
我们得走了 长官 We need to go, sir.
别走啊 Come on!
皮特 皮特 她的手 Pete, Pete, Pete.

把你准备给她戴上的戒指给我 Give me the ring that you were gonna put on that hand.
订婚戒指 我需要那颗钻石 The engagement ring.

把钻石给我 Give me the diamond.
恭喜你们 Congratulations.
托比 Toby.
你在想什么 What are you thinking?
我们要做个信号弹 We need to create a signal flare.
我们现在四周 And what is the one element
最多的元素是什么 that we have in spades around here?
是火 That would be fire.
没错 感谢吉米 Exactly.

我们有硼 we have boron.
现在火势在以2204摄氏度的高温 Now, fires out there are burning upwards
向上烧 of 4,000 degrees.
而硼的熔点是2076摄氏度 Boron melts at 3,700.
你确定吗 You insured that, right?
硼对白金 Boron also has a deoxidizing effect...
也有脱氧效应 ...on white gold,
这样就能生成绿色的烟 all of which combine to form a green plume of smoke!
快点 快点 Come on.

在那 There!
在那里 有信号 Right there!

-在哪

他们还活着 快调头 They're still alive!

快调头 Turn around!
把这个浇湿 然后拿这捂着脸 Douse those in water and hold over your faces.
这瓶空了 This one's empty.
-我的也是

老天 我们完了 Oh, God, this is it.
乐乐 我不会为之前的行为道歉 Happy, I'm not gonna apologize for what I did earlier,
因为我是想保护你 'cause I wanted to protect you.
到了现在我想你也该明白了 By now, I figured you'd know why,
但以防你还没明白 我希望最后的遗言 but in case you don't know, I want my last words
有些意义 to have some meaning.
乐乐·奎恩 我爱...

时机真好 Perfect timing.
走 快走 Let's go!

直升机在南边18米的地方 Got our chopper 20 yards south!
希尔维斯特呢 Where's Sylvester?
我以为他跟你在一起 I thought he was with you.
没有 我们把他留在坠机点了 No, we left him at the crash site.
坠机点都被烧尽了 沃特 走 Crash site got burned over, Walter.

快点 走啊孩子 Come on.

我们得赶紧离开 We got to evac now!
我们得等希尔维斯特 We have to wait for Sylvester.
火要烧过来了 Fire's too close.
得走了 We got to go!
不能丢下同伴 Not without our man!
我了解希尔维斯特 I know Sylvester.
他思维方式跟我们一样 他会来的 He thinks like us.

他没到我就不走 And I'm not gonna leave without him.
升到高空后 We can look for him
我们可以再找他 when we're back up top again.
我们得走了 长官 We need to go now, sir.
不行 不可能 Negative!

在那 在那 There!

沃特 Walter!
放下他 放下他 没事了 Put him down.

托比 他失了不少血 Toby, he's lost a lot of blood.
好了 快走 All right, let's move out!
看来他们把火势控制住了 Sounds like they're getting a handle on the fire.
傍晚应该就能灭了 Should have it contained by nightfall.
听着 我们之前有过不少危机 Look, I know we've had some close calls together, but...
但今天真的是命悬一线 today was extra dicey.
你很担心我们 You were worried about us.
这还用说 In so many words, yes.
很高兴你们都没事 I'm glad you're all okay.
伙计们 我们开始讨他喜欢了 Guys, we're growing on him.
真多愁善感 Softy.
抱歉 抱歉 Excuse me.

一定要好好照顾他 Please be careful with him.
希尔维斯特 Sylvester.
你会没事的 会没事的 You're gonna be okay.

你这混蛋真命硬 You're one tough son of a bitch.
我要是你爸一定骄傲死了 I'd be proud as hell to call you my kid.
抬起来 Lift.
就是个便宜货 Uh, it's just costume jewelry,
但应该能行 but it should do the job.
当时情况挺紧张啊 Got pretty intense out there.
是啊 火挺大的 Yeah.

我说的不是火 I wasn't talking about the fire.
人在水深火热的时候总会说傻话 People say stupid things in the heat of battle.
不 我是真心的 No, I meant it.
我当时选择诚实面对自己 I chose in the moment to live honestly,
要是你还没有感觉 and if you don't feel the same way yet,
我也没关系 I'm okay with it.
-挺有自信的啊

我有自信能下一个新赌注 I'm confident enough to make another wager.
赌什么 What are the stakes?
我要是赢了 你带我吃晚餐 If I win, you take me to dinner.
要是我赢了呢 And if I win?
就我带你去 I take you.
这什么情况 What is all that?
托比这段时间在忙活的事 It's something that Toby's been working on.
他还有闲工夫画漫画 I got to give the kid more work
看来得多给他点事干了 if he's got time to draw cartoons.
这一天真多波折 Hell of a day.
细想也挺荒唐的 Ridiculous if you think about it.
一个人对浪漫爱情的信念 One man's belief in romantic love
毁了架直升机 四百英亩的森林 destroys a helicopter, 400 acres of forest,
还差点害死一堆人 nearly kills a dozen people.
心想所想 Heart wants what the heart wants.
心脏只是促进血液循环的肌肉 Heart is a circulatory muscle.
仅此而已 Nothing more.
听着像是没恋爱过的人说出来的 Spoken like someone who's never been in love.
但愿某天会有所改变 Hope that changes for you one day, pal.
保重 沃特 Take care, Walter.
有肉桂 真恶心 Ugh, it's cinnamon.
