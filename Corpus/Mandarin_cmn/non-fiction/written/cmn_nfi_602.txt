等等 所以这里就是...

狂欢节浮动设施的储存仓库 Storage warehouse for Mardi Gras floats.
可以把这里想象成是巫毒女王 Think of it as long

和邪恶小丑们的长期停车场 demonic court jesters.
每年有一个月 这里是节目的中心 Yeah, a month out of the year, it's a hub of activity.
其余11个月 是狗和流浪汉的栖所 The other 11 months, it's a home for dogs, vagrants...
以及偷铜丝者的家 And apparently, guys stealing copper wires.
我等不及我的第一个狂欢节了 I cannot wait for my first Mardi Gras.
噢 简直棒极了 你绝对没见过这样的场面 Oh, it's fantastic.

这可不一定 大二的暑假 I don't know.

我在游乐园打工 那儿有只弹钢琴的小猪 I worked at an amusement park, they had a piano

-"猪伯拉斯"

源自美国钢琴家李伯拉斯（Liberace）
我们可不能再这么见面了 Loretta We got to stop meeting like this, Loretta.
的确是啊 Isn't that the truth.
新奥尔良警方(NOPD)已经处理过现场 NOPD's been processing the scene.
海军士官 Jonathan Bell Petty Officer Jonathan Bell.
对 他是[路易斯安那]贝尔查斯Hume上将办公室的副官 Yeah, flag writer for Admiral Hume's office in Belle Chasse.
Hume负责东南地区的海军设备 Uh, Hume is in charge of Naval facilities for the Southeast Region.
交给我吧 I'll take that.
我在登记证物 I'm just cataloguing the evidence.
我女朋友Melissa一直催我要走出来 多参与现实世界 My girlfriend Melissa keeps pushing me to get out into the real world some more,
所以我自愿加入这个任务 so I kind of volunteered for assignment.
你有女朋友 叫Melissa There's a girlfriend, Melissa?
死因是什么 Cause of death?
昨晚十点左右 子弹射入心脏 Shot in the heart, about 10:

两颗点45口径的弹壳 Two .

三个弹孔 And three bullet holes.
两个在背上 腰部那里 Two in his back, lower flank...
一个在躯干中央 ...one center mass.
其中一个可能是射出伤么 One possibly an exit?
我觉得不是 I don't think so.
这两处伤口看起来 These two wounds look to be roughly...
直径约一厘米 a centimeter in diameter.
而致命的一枪要更大些 The kill shot

更大口径 Bigger caliber.
-两种不同的武器

不过...

要尸检时才能确定 Wait for an autopsy.
这里有玫瑰 Roses over here
说明他在跟某人见面 suggest he was meeting someone.
啊 并不是普通的对象 Ah, not just anybody.
我在他口袋里找到这个 I found this in his pocket.
订婚戒指 如果这是抢劫 盒子早就空了 Engagement ring?

那么...

我觉得他一开始地方就选错了 I think his first mistake was probably the setting.
或者 她真的很不喜欢玫瑰 Or...

我觉得不是这样 在他口袋还找到这个 I don't think it's about that

"12朵玫瑰 12个理由" "12 Roses, 12 Reasons."
可怜的家伙 一定特紧张 Poor guy.

列出了他们的共同点 List of things they have in common:
"对嘉年华会的热爱""对Zydeco音乐的热情" "Love of carnival." "Passion for zydeco music""
起源于路易斯安那州的黑人舞曲 类似蓝调
"最爱的书 John Irving写的《为欧文·米尼祈祷》" "Favorite book, A Prayer for Owen Meany by John Irving."
"每次我遇到困境 就会想到你 "Whenever I'm having a hard time, I think of you
并且意识到 我们是天生一对" and realize we are perfect for each other"
听起来像是Celine Dion歌曲的歌词 Sounds like the lyrics to a Celine Dion song.
加拿大歌手 词曲作者 泰坦尼克号主题曲《我心依旧》的演唱者
噢 我也不是很懂这个 Oh, not that I'd know.
手机呢 Cell phone?
嗯 好 Yeah.

应该可以告诉我们很多Bell士官的信息 That should tell us plenty about what Petty Officer Bell's been up to.
跟进他的家人 Follow up with the family,
Hume上将的办公室 Admiral Hume's office.
找出知情者告诉我们 这些玫瑰是要送给谁的 Find someone who can give us a name to put with these roses.

特别探员Pride Special Agent Pride.
我去儿童医院时 遇到Phil和他儿子 I met Phil and his son when I was visiting the children's hospital.
我以为他是逗孩子们开心的小丑 Thought he was the clown meant to entertain the kids.
只不过 我并没有穿小丑服 Only I wasn't wearing a clown suit.
无心之过 不过瞅瞅他 我搞错情况也可以理解 是吧 It was an honest mistake, but, I mean, come on, right?
我可不掺合 Not gonna touch that.
小Robbie怎么样了 How is little Robbie?
还是老样子 谢谢关心 He's about the same.

我猜你们来 是因为Bell士官的案子 I assume you're here about what happened to Petty Officer Bell.
-你认识他么

我被派遣到Fleetwood上将身边 He was my replacement when I left Admiral Hume
他接替我做Hume上将的副官 for an assignment with Admiral Fleetwood.
说实话 我都得嘱咐Jonathan 别干得太出色 In fact, I had to tell Jonathan to stop doing such a good job.
跟他一对比 显得我很差劲了 He was making me look bad in retrospect.
现在悲剧发生 我暂时负责Hume的事务 Given the tragedy, I'm covering Hume's desk
直到他们找到接替人员 until they can find a replacement.
嗯 不耽误你们正事了 Well, uh, I'll let you get to it.
嘿 等你有时间 咱俩去喝两杯 Hey, let's grab a beer when you got a minute or two.
那太好了 很荣幸见到你们 I'd love that.

比患病儿童更让人难过的 就是患病儿童的家长 Only thing harder than a sick kid is a parent with a sick kid.
Bell士官是个极其优秀的年轻人 Petty Officer Bell was an outstanding young man,
无论是个人修养还是工作方面 both personally and professionally.
努力 细致 Hard

他管理我的日程安排 准备会议 He managed my schedule

预定晚餐 还告诉我什么时候该去锻炼 dinner reservations, and...

目前我们关注的是他的个人生活 We're looking into his personal life at the moment.
具体来讲 就是他的恋人 Specifically, who he might have been romantically involved with.
那就是Maria了 Uh, that would be Maria.
有Maria的姓氏和住址么 Happen to have a last name and address for Maria?
她姓Garcia 我记得她之前住在洛杉矶 Last name's Garcia, and I think she was living in Los Angeles,
不过他们正打算安排她搬来这里 but they were in the process of moving her out here.
你知道他们有什么矛盾么 Do you know if they were having any problems?
为什么 你觉得是她杀了他吗 Why?

他对她十分痴迷 说她是他的灵魂伴侣 He was crazy about her.

我不认识她 不过他们看起来十分相爱 I didn't know her, but they seemed to be very much in love.
长官 Sir?
不好意思 稍等一下 I'm sorry.

好 那么 Okay, so...
Maria Garcia 最好的可能性 Maria Garcia

她是潜在目击者 a potential witness.
最坏的情况...

她是第一嫌疑人 Suspect numero uno.
找到她 Find her...
这样才能发现 她到底是哪种 so we can figure out which one it is.
洛杉矶郡有25000个Maria Garcia There are 25,000 Maria Garcias in Los Angeles County.
我们登录了加利福尼亚州的车管局数据库 We logged into California's DMV database,
目前尚未发现与她照片相符的人 but so far no matches to her picture.
我们正在查询航空公司 公交线路 酒店 We're checking into airlines, bus lines, hotels
看近期是否有这个名字的人来到新奥尔良 不过...

需要时间 Takes time.
我们从Bell的手机里找到联系方式 We took the contacts from Bell's cell,
发了语音留言 邮件和短信 and we left messages via phone, e

我们和她的各项服务提供商合作 We're working with her providers to try
希望能找到账单地址 to come up with a billing address.
我深入研究了Bell的网络生活 Okay, so I dug deep into Bell's digital life,
找到了他的网上社交媒体 and I got access to his online social media.
有几件有趣的事 Couple of interesting things.
第一 他把状态改成了 Number one, he changed his status
"与Maria Garcia恋爱中" to "in a relationship with Maria Garcia."
他都要向她求婚了 这不算什么新闻 Well, considering he was about to propose to her, not really news.
不 新鲜的是 他更改状态后不久 No, the news is, moments after he changed his status
就开始受到本地一个混小子 he started being threatened online
Rodney Abbott的威胁 by some surly local dude named Rodney Abbott.
"威胁"怎么讲 Define "threatened."
"离Maria远一点 不然我把你心掏出来" "Stay away from Maria or I'll cut out your heart."
-真含蓄

这位Rodney Abbott最近也把状态改为了 this Rodney Abbott also changed his status recently to
"与Maria Garcia恋爱中" "in a relationship with Maria Garcia."
跟同一城市的两个小伙陷入情网 Well, getting involved with two guys in the same city
似乎有点冒险啊 seems a little risky.
三角恋以失败告终 A love triangle gone bad.
三角恋难道有好结果么 Is a love triangle ever a good thing?
哥就成功过 I've made it work from time to time.
好吧 所以说...

洛杉矶郡有25000个Maria Garcia 25,000 Maria Garcias in Los Angeles.
那么新奥尔良有多少个Rodney Abbott How many Rodney Abbotts in New Orleans?
干啥 What?
是Rodney Abbott么 Rodney Abbott?
你们是谁 Who wants to know?
海军罪案调查处 你有时间么 NCIS.

没有 Not really.
你现在有空了 这是搜查令 You do now.

因为你在网上威胁Jonathan Bell士官 for cyber

我们要四处看看 We're gonna take a look around.
乱七八糟的破烂 连二手店都不如 Looks like a thrift store took a crap in here.
我要录音 I'm recording this.
以免你们对我动手 In case you guys get all brutal on me.
Pride Pride...
过来 Go on.
靠墙站好 Get up against the wall.
把手举起来 Hands out where I can see 'em.
交给我吧 I got this.
你认识Jonathan Bell么 You know a man named Jonathan Bell?
我不必回答那个问题 I don't gotta answer that.
是的 你的确"不必" No, you don't "gotta."
但我建议你最好回答 But I'm suggesting it's in your best interest.
嘿 King 我找到个东西 Hey, King, I found something.
点45口径 和谋杀案武器一致 .45 caliber

少了两颗子弹 Two bullets missing.
还找到两颗弹壳 想不到吧 And we found two shell casings

现在我们"必须"谈谈了 Now we're more in the area of "gotta."
你为什么那么做 Why'd you do it?
他在纠缠我女朋友 He was messing with my girl.
Maria Garcia么 Maria Garcia?
我告诉他离她远点 但他不听 I told him to stay away, and he didn't,
所以...

两枪 了结 Two shots

玻璃后面是谁 Who's behind that glass there?
-我知道你在那里

进展如何 How's it going?
我觉得我们应该对Abbott进行72小时精神监控 I think we should get a 72

但是...

我们可能已经创下"破案最短时间"记录了 we may have just set a speed record for solving a case.
-说到这个

你在考虑精神监控的时候 While you're getting that psych hold,
Loretta有新发现了 Loretta has some news.
不要以为Abbott是凶手 Don't think Abbott was your killer.
他已经承认了 He confessed.
科学不在乎谎言 Science doesn't care about the lies men tell.
Sebastian说弹道信息吻合 Sebastian said the ballistics matched.
没错 They do.
并且弹壳上有Rodney的指纹 And Rodney's fingerprints are on the shell casings.
-是的

记得我告诉过你 Remember I told you
他似乎是被两种不同口径的子弹击中的 it looked like he was shot by two different caliber bullets?
事实就是如此 Turns out to be the case.
他被击中三次 He was shot three times

两次是Rodney的点45口径 一次是 twice by Rodney's .

点30口径 by a .

据组织和骨头损伤来判断 很可能是来复枪 Likely a rifle, based on the tissue and bone damage.
我发现这个嵌在脾脏里 I found this embedded in the spleen.
Abbott只承认他开了两枪 Abbott only confessed to two shots.
关键信息是 Here's the important part:
这颗点30口径的子弹才是致命的一枪 The .

Abbott的两颗子弹是在Bell死后击中的 Abbott's two bullets came after Bell died,
在没有血液流动之后 after there was no blood flow.
Abbott对已经死了的人开枪么 Abbott shot a guy who was already dead?
而你的"点30口径"的凶手 And your .

仍然逍遥在外 is still out there somewhere.
-你对我们说谎了

我都说了 我对那混蛋开了两枪 I told you, I shot the jerk twice.
我可以接受测谎 I'll take a lie detector.
验尸官的报告显示 The coroner's report says that...
你在他死后才开枪 your shots were fired postmortem.
就是指他已经死了以后 That means after his death.
我知道是什么意思 你以为我不知道么 I know what it means.

我们很难判断 你知道什么 不知道什么 It's hard for us to tell right now what you know and what you don't.
我知道很多你不认为我不知道的 I know lots of stuff you don't think I don't know.
好啊 Okay, then...
那告诉我们 是谁杀了Bell士官 tell us who killed Petty Officer Bell.
我和Maria见面 一起喝酒 Look...

她求我帮她摆脱那谁的纠缠 She begged me to help her get away from what's his name.
他让她感到"窒息" He was "suffocating" her.
她的原话 Her words.
她跟我说 她觉得他要求婚了 She told me she thought he was gonna pop the question.
在储存仓库么 At a storage warehouse?
Maria特喜欢狂欢节 Maria had a thing for "Mardi Gras".
这也是 It was one of the reasons
她想搬过来的原因之一 she wanted to move out here.
要我说 拜托 I mean, come on.
太明显了吧 So on the nose.
再说 那家伙在哪儿求婚并不重要 Besides, it didn't matter where that guy got down on one knee,
因为Maria一定会拒绝的 'cause Maria, she was always gonna say no.
所以我...

我到的时候 他已经死了 He was already dead when I got there.
所以你还是对他开枪了 So you shot him anyway?
我觉得他活该 Well, I felt like he deserved it.
这没犯法吧 I mean, it's not a crime
因为已经有人把他杀了 是不 if someone else killed him first, is it?
我们需要和Maria谈谈 We need to talk to Maria.
我已经告诉你了 Maria跟这事儿没关系 Well, I already told you, Maria,she didn't have anything to do with this.
那她就没什么好担心的了 Well, then she doesn't have anything to sorry about.
我们只想找她聊聊 We just want to talk to her.
她在哪儿 Rodney Where is she, Rodney?
我们认为Rodney在替Maria顶罪 We think Rodney's covering for Maria.
他可能跟踪Maria Garcia到仓库 He may have followed Maria Garcia to the warehouse,
看到她射杀Bell 之后他向Bell的尸体 saw her shoot Bell, then he puts two slugs
又开了两枪 使这事看起来是他做的 into Bell's corpse to make it look like he did it.
他似乎宁可承认他没犯下的 Seems like he'd rather take the rap
谋杀罪名 也不愿出卖她 for a murder he didn't commit than give her up.
这就是爱情 Now, that's love

一种John Hinckley式的 疯狂至极的爱情 in a John Hinckley, bat

Hinckley刺杀美国总统里根 想引起女星Jodie Foster的注意
这是一种理论 That's a theory.
我想和她直接聊聊这个理论 One I'd like to talk with her about directly.

第二 你们的对话应该这样进行 and B, this is the way the conversation should go.
大脚野人存在么 不 Is there a such thing as a yeti?

我们观点不同 Well, we have a different point of view.
不 你的观点不是"不同" No, you don't have a different point of view.
你根本就是错了 "错"和"不同"区别可大了 You're just wrong.

噢 等一下 Oh, wait a minute.

我为什么要帮你们这些战争贩子 Why should I help you warmongers?
我给你个简略版本吧 I'll give you the short version.
我们一离开这儿 我就立马 Soon as we leave here, the first call
给一个叫做Andy Leeds的人打电话 I'm gonna make is to a guy named Andy Leeds.
那个名字对我来说有什么意义吗 Is that name supposed to mean something to me?
应该有 两个月后 Should.

你将站在他面前申请假释 in two months to ask for parole.
你怎么想 James What do you think, James?
你想让我说你坏话么 You want me to say bad things about you?
你们想要敲诈我 You guys are trying to blackmail me
这样你们就可以对Drayer施压 so you can pressure Drayer.
我跟你说过 他会明白的 I told you he'd get it.
-你们听说过Conficker病毒么

Drayer是研发它的主要人员 Drayer had a major hand in creating it.
那种病毒造成了许多破坏 Caused a lot of damage.
如果你跟Leeds说点好话 我会给你足够信息 If you say something to Leeds, I'll give you enough dirt
让Drayer全盘招供 to make Drayer sing like a canary.

和杀死Bell士官的子弹一样 Same that was used to kill Petty Officer Bell.
不出所料 弹道测试匹配 No surprise

杀死Bell和Drayer的是同一把枪 Same gun that was used to kill Bell was used to kill Drayer.
我敢跟你打赌 And I'll bet you dollars to donuts that
枪手就是雇Drayer去进行网络骗局的人 the shooter is the one who hired Drayer to do the catfishing.
所以Drayer欺骗Bell开始恋情 Okay, so Drayer tricks Bell,starts a relationship...
Bell知道上将每天的日程 Bell knew the admiral's day

他见谁 他在做什么 他去哪儿 who he was meeting with, what he was doing, where he was going.
但是Hume上将只负责基地设施 But Admiral Hume was a facilities guy.
他到底掌握了什么敏感信息 I mean,what kind of sensitive information
能让人不惜杀人也要拿到 would he have that someone would kill to get a hold of.
那是最终谜团 That's the question of the day.
在我们找到答案前 Till we know the answer to that...
为Hume上将安排安保人员 request a security detail for Admiral Hume,
和P.

The Protective Operations Field Office 护卫行动基地办公室
确保我们跟进上将的行程 make sure that we're looped into the admiral's schedule.
马上去办 I'm on it.
Sebastian找到线索了 Sebastian's got information.
这是Drayer和Bell的网聊记录 Here's what we've got from the Drayer

就是人们约会时通常聊的内容 It's just the usual stuff people chat about when they're dating.
你我的"通常"可能不太一样 Your usual and my usual are probably not the same.
就比如 他们那天干了什么 You know, stuff like what they did that day,
看了什么电视 在网上看到什么搞笑的东西 TV shows they watch, what funny stuff they saw online.
这就是你和你女朋友聊的东西么 Is that what...

我没被网络欺骗 I'm not being catfished.
我不是...

我也许还没当面见过我女朋友 I may not have met my girlfriend in person,
但我和一个真正的女人视频聊天过 but I've skyped with an actual female human being.
我只是问你们会聊些什么 I just asked what you talked about.
随便问问 Casual question.
但既然你提到了 我...

你怎么会还没见过Melissa How come you've never met Melissa?
嗯 Um...
因为和人交往 新的人 because with people

有可能成为女朋友的新人 new people of the possible girlfriend variety

她们是世界上最可怕的人 they're the scariest people in the whole wide world.
而距离让你有安全感 And distance keeps you safe?
即便我提前知道 Knowing what I know now

我们会分居 甚至可能会离婚 separated, possible divorce

我仍然会穿过院子 I'd still go across the quad
邀请19岁的Linda Walters and ask a 19

我破解了Drayer电脑的数据加密 I cracked the encryption on Drayer's computer.
给"双P"再记一功 Chalk up another "V" for Double P.
天 这个Drayer很厉害 Boy, this Drayer was good.
这家伙设计了一个加密攻击 This guy designed a cryptographic attack
使得计算机无法区分 so that the output of the infected cryptosystem
被感染的密码系统的输出结果 could be computationally indistinguishable from the output
与未被感染的密码系统的输出结果 of the corresponding uninfected cryptosystem.
然后他用一个非对称加密 Then he used a asymmetric encryption
植入了这个加密后门 to implement the cryptographic back door.
你这是什么意思 What do you mean by that?
-哪部分

你只需要知道"后门"就行了 The only thing you got to understand is "back door"
-我就是这么说的

-伙计们

来让Bell谈论自己 as a way to get Bell to talk all about himself.
这样关系变得私密 And in doing so, and getting personal,
Bell给了Drayer Bell gave Drayer hints that allowed Drayer
破解自己密码的信息 to decipher Bell's passwords.
有了这些密码 And with passwords came the ability
就可以植入后门 to put in this back door.
这样Bell和Hume上将之间的通讯 或者他为上将进行的通讯...

Marco Drayer都能够获取 Marco Drayer had access to?
-完全正确

-不是吧

我一直在想 Drayer为什么这么急着离开 I've been thinking why Drayer was leaving town in such a hurry.
很显然有什么东西吓到他了 And clearly, something spooked him
就在你们第一次遇到他 between the first time you encountered him
以及他被枪杀之间 and when he was shot.
于是我想到了他的最后一餐 Which made me think about his last meal.
他的胃容物 Contents of his stomach?

担心自己是瓮中之鳖 我不会...

我不会在城里最高档的餐厅 I am not...

悠闲地品尝美餐 in one of the city's most elegant restaurants.
除非我去那里 是有目的的 Unless I'm there for a purpose.
这就是Arnaud餐厅的监控录像 So, this is the security video from Arnaud's?
是的 我去了这家餐厅 和领班 Yes.

聊了一下 他记得见过Drayer with the maitre d'

他没有按照规定穿外套 who went in without a jacket, which is required,
所以他们借了他一件 so they lent him one.
领班说他和这个女人用了餐 Maitre d' said he had dinner with this woman,
她用现金付了钱 who paid in cash.
在你看来 她像个杀手么 She look like an assassin to you?
不知道 Drayer看起来焦躁不安 Don't know.

但我们可以让Bruce告诉我们 But we'll let Bruce tell us.
你也管它叫Bruce You, too, with the Bruce?
Chris为面部识别系统起名为Bruce
入乡随俗嘛 When in Rome.

如果她真的做了这些事 If she did what we're saying she did...
天知道接下来会有什么大乱子 God only knows what mayhem's next.
等一下 Pride 看看这个 Hang on...

做她这种工作的女人 是不会用信用卡 A woman in her line of work is not going to use a credit card
留下书面痕迹的 and leave a paper trail.
所以她钱包里的卡 So the card in her wallet...
我猜是她酒店房间的房卡 ...I'm guessing is a key card to her hotel room.
看不出这是C还是G Can't tell if that's a "C" or a "G".
你可以搜"蓝色房卡"或者以C开头的酒店 You can search "blue card key" or hotels that start with "C"...
是"C" "C".
