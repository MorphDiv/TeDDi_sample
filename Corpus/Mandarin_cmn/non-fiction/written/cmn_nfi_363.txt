中文字幕制作：

（自嘲） 不是今这个赛季，不
今个赛季很容易 (CHUCKLING) Pretty easy this year.
有的时候是，你懂的 Sometimes it's, "Mmm..." I hope so.
怎么评价鲁尼 "What's Rooney like?"
过去经常有人问我，怎么评价坎通纳，怎么评价C罗 Used to be, "What's Cantona like?

怎么评价贝克汉姆？

他们都牛逼：

不，我来告诉你，这是在这里的也是最后的五个赛季。

"Are you going again next year?

你到底撒时候退役呢？

对于我来说，曼联就像我生命的根基。

自从13岁那年来到这里，我学到了很多很多。

不断取胜,永不言弃的态度，这里的辉煌历史， Winning, never

每一天对我来说都是在不断学习新的东西， learning things every day 这是一个给你带来幸运的地方 and just a great place to be fortunate
20年如一日 to go every day for over 20 years.
小贝：

只要他在场 once he stepped on the field,
你就知道会有特殊的事情发生了 you know that something special was going to happen,
这也是他的职业生业如此辉煌的原因 and that's one of the reasons why he's had the career that he's had.
这也是他为什么可以一直坚持踢下去 It's one of the reasons why he's been able to play
直到40岁的年龄还在世界顶级的足球联赛中踢球的原因 up until the age of 40 at the highest level in football.
老斯：

我真心觉得斯哥是我和我一起合作过的球员中最顶尖的一个 and I think Giggs would be the best one I've ever played with.
亨利.

你从未见过一个有着如此远动天赋的球员 You won't see a player with that athleticism, with that intelligence
每个赛季都渴望在出现在赛场 and to have that hunger season after season, to turn up
尽力保持自己的竞技状态去追逐一个又一个奖杯 to push your body through chasing trophy after trophy.
13个英超联赛，2个欧洲冠军杯 Thirteen Premier League trophies, two Champions Leagues as well.
瑞恩吉格斯会被作为英超最佳球员所铭记 Ryan Giggs will be remembered as the greatest player
瑞恩吉格斯会被作为英超最佳球员所铭记 to have graced the Premier League.
加里内维尔：

通常你得等20年或者当你去世的时候才 You usually have to wait 20 years 有别人为你立碑铸像 or when you're dead to get a statue,
但是已他的成就来说，他不用等那么久 but he shouldn't have to for what he's achieved.
佛格森爵士（老爷子）：

可以作为一个左边锋在边路大杀四方 that can get up and down that touchline
可以作为一个左边锋在边路大杀四方 as an outside left,
即崇尚进攻又愿意及时回防 attacking but willing to go back to defend,
始终对胜利充满渴望 the attitude to winning all the time.
在英超没有一个球员可以达到那种高度 There's no player in the Premier League who gets anywhere near that.
球迷们：

吉格斯会一次次击溃你 # Giggs Giggs will tear you apart again
(球迷继续高歌)
(球迷欢呼)
(一起高唱)
这是内维尔兄弟送的一瓶上等红酒 This was off Gary, Gary Nev, Gary Neville, a nice bottle of red wine.
是的，意大利货，但是我认为 Yeah, Italian, but I think
霍奇森和格雷汉姆(均为前利物浦主教练） Roy Hodgson and Graham Souness have got him
比较喜欢我的球衣 into a tracksuit as well.
斯泰西：

你看，这里还有睡衣 Oh, pyjamas, sorry.
你看，当我穿上睡衣的时候就很兴奋， Yeah, that shows my age 这说明我已经老了：

(笑CRY)
这是俱乐部的周边，保罗史密斯包（好想要） This was off the club, Paul Smith bag,
灰常棒！

你知道吗，当我17岁那年来到这里，看着马克休斯 I mean, I started when l was 17, and I'm looking at people like Mark Hughes,
大概也就28，29岁的样子。

32，33岁，我现在想，我勒个去，这些都是化石级的球员 32, 33, and I'm thinking, God, they're ancient.
所以，谁知道贾努扎伊，菲尔琼斯 So God knows what the likes of Adnan and Phil Jones
维尔贝克他们会怎么想我到底有多老 and Danny Welbeck, people like that, are thinking of how old I am.
这感觉奇怪啊，哥首次登台的时候 It's killing me.

所以如果有一天哥不干了，那也挺好 I'll be glad when it's over.
(笑CRY)
当你年轻的时候，17岁18岁的年纪， When you were younger, 17, 18 你就会去玩，去踢球 you'd just go out and play
这都是不叫事，感觉萌萌哒。

特别是马上就奔4的时候 especially toward the end of your 30s,
我依然可以比赛，但是感觉就很糟糕了 you can play in a game and you just feel absolutely rubbish.
可能是准备不足吧 Maybe your preparation hasn't been right,
或者因为你的第一场或者第二次比赛 or maybe it's your first game, or even your second game,
你还找不到比赛的状态 and you just don't feel match fit.
那是就会想，确定自己要再来一个赛季？

你现在依旧是大家议论的对象吗？

你现在依旧对比赛充满热情吗？

你依然开心吗？

我从训练场走过来，看到他们都带着吉格斯的面具 I've come in from training, walked in and they've all got their Giggsy masks on,
在更衣室里都是我职业生涯不同时期的的照片 and then around the dressing room was just different pictures of me
有些也不是那么炫酷，有点，你懂的 throughout my career, some not too flattering.

有点小尴尬 Bit embarrassing.
最佳传中？

不要在意这些细节 That sort of thing.
对，哥现在要忍啊 So, yeah, I took a bit of stick today.
其中一些照片已经把哥的形象毁了，是不是：

他可以从刚夺冠的庆祝宴会中一个猫王式的聚会达人 He could switch from being Elvis
抽身出来 and rapping at a party where we've just won the league,
立马投入到训练场中，而且是全身心的投入 and then he's on the field and totally focused
去完成那些需要他完成的训练任务 in exactly what he needs to do.
这是他众多牛逼之处的体现之一 That's one of the great things about Giggsy.
瑞恩：

因为老爷子在曼联待了那么久，现在他已经离开了 because Sir Alex had left and he'd been here for so long.
作为一个球员，我知道这不会带来好的结果 As a player, yeah, you know that the results ain't going right
但是要努力做的更好，不管是球员自己还是整个球队 and you want to do better, both as an individual and as a team.
在这个时刻 At the moment,
我不常出场 well, I'm not playing and
我们当然也不会每场都赢，所以 we're obviously not winning every game, so, yeah, it's, uh...
这个赛季对我来说毫无疑问是令人失望的 Yeah, it's been an obviously disappointing season all round for me.
你可以系鞋带的同时接着颠球吗？

来，秀一个 INTERVIEWER:

球技好，就是任性：

一下子，当你已经38，39的时候，你不得不说 Suddenly, when you get to 38, 39, you have to say...
不得不对自己说 You say to yourself, 是时候离开了 "When is he going to quit?"
当然这个问题也无数次的在吉格斯的脑海里回响 And he probably has asked the same question himself,
但是你看吉格斯就是那种令人意想不到的人 but he's such an exceptional human being
他继续投身其中，这是多么了不起的事情 that he carried on, and that's quite amazing.
新闻联播：

我们要对即将到来的的记者招待会 we'll have more reaction to 做出反应 the managers' press conference.
电视里说了些什么？

史黛西：

他已经快到做决定的时候了 and he was on the verge,
因为他说，有一天我会功成身退 um, because he said, "I could be going out on a high,"
那时人们都会认为，我真不错 which we all thought, "Great,"
然后他就决定再坚持下去 and then he was persuaded to stay.
我认为他如果真的退役了的话会非常煎熬的 I think he's going to really struggle when he finishes
because he's had that same routine for 25 years, 因为他已经25年如一日的这样工作了 117 然后估计觉得没什么事可以做 and to then have, well, maybe nothing to do,
对他来讲这是非常困难的 it's going to be really hard.
孩子们买了这些礼物， The kids bought him these, and the club 俱乐部每年都会给他寄那些礼物过来 sends him one of them every year,
这个yogo我觉得是BBC给送的 and I think that one's from the BBC, this yoga one.
这个太刁了

1：

瑞恩：

这是一些记录 That's getting recorded.
内维尔兄弟会过来一起做个访问 "Gary and Phil Neville join together for a special QA event
为他们家乡的波里俱乐部筹款。

我会去参加的 I'll be watching that.
我对他的初次印象是他 First memory of him was an overhead kick 在克利夫对阵刘易舍姆的倒钩射门 he scored at The Cliff
那年我们才15岁 against Lewisham when we were Under 15s,
那时候我想，我得是要花多大努力才能赶上他的水平啊 and thinking, "I've got a long way to go to get to that level."
他就是那种街上那种出人头地的那种 He was just streets ahead of everybody
在足球方面，从来没有见过像他这样的 that we'd ever met, really, in terms of football.

球就好像黏在他脚上 The ball was stuck to his feet.
他的左脚哦，哈哈:

他的右脚我就再不说了 He can't dribble with his right.
作为一个曼联铁杆粉，你从来没有不会去想有一天 As a United fan, you never think anybody 有人可以打破博比查尔顿爵士的出场记录 can beat Sir Bobby Charlton's record.
慢慢的，你会认为这是这一个过去20年中难以逾越的高峰 Growing up, you just think that it's a mountain of games over 20 years.
吉格斯所取得的成就是无与伦比的 The achievements of him are just incredible.
这个记录再不会被打破了， It'll never be beaten.

瑞恩：

巴克莱英超联赛给颁发的 by the Barclay's Premier League.
是那种庆祝顶级联赛20年的奖 They sort of had a celebration of 20 years of the Premier League,
还有这个是在顶级联赛出场500次的纪念 and this was in recognition of over 500 Premier League appearances,
他们2012年颁发给我的 which they gave me in 2012.
这双战靴是我在莫斯科穿夺得欧冠的时候 These were the boots that I wore in Moscow,
穿的（梦回2008） when we won the Champions League.
那场比赛我打破了博比查尔顿爵士的出场记录 It was the game that I broke Sir Bobby Charlton's appearance record.
他是令人意想不到的出色球员， 总把球控制在脚下 那是多么强大的一种力量。

(INAUDIBLE)
瑞恩：

他在埃弗顿取得了很大的成功 done brilliantly with Everton,
这一点和弗格森爵士在曼联取得的成就 在某种程度上来说是类似的 similar sort of traits as Sir Alex and, yeah,
我认为这是一个正确的的选择 I thought it was the right appointment.
我会在春季续签合同，莫耶斯在夏天的时候 I'd signed another year in March, April.

给我打电话问我是否愿意成为教练组的一员 and asked me if I'd like to be part of the staff as well,
当然对我来说那是一个巨大的挑战而且教练 which I thought it was a great challenge 也是我职业生涯下一步的规划 for me and the next step in my career.
我大概从十年前开始执教 I started my coaching maybe ten years ago.

我们有权使用球员 we had the access to the players
现在看起来那是一件正确的事情 and it just seemed the right thing to do at the time.
显然，30多岁了，你也许可能再踢一两年就退役了 Obviously 30, so you could be finishing in two or three years' time,
所以这是一种心态，你懂吧 so it was that sort of mindset, "Right,
我们需要时刻准备着上场，时刻准备着终场哨吹响。

(PLAYERS EXCLAIMING)
你知道的，在一个球员职业生涯的最后阶段 You know, you come to your end of your career
是非常难熬的，而且会变得越来越糟糕 and it's horrible, it's the worst...
最糟糕的事情莫过于我过去已经职业的面对过这些问题了 It's the worst thing probably I've ever had to deal with professionally.
当你临近挂靴之时 Coming to the end of your football career,
每个人都会对你坚持的越久越好 everyone tells you to play for as long as you possibly can
因为职业球员一旦退役所面临生存境遇落差是很大的 because the next stage of your life is not as good
因为你将不在去从事足球这项你钟爱的运动 because you're not playing football, the sport that you love,
所以他从某种程度上发觉 so he's gotta somehow find...
发觉是时候该结束了 Find something inside him that brings closure on his football career.
瑞恩：

所以时常会问自己我对球队还有多少贡献？

如果我去年退役了，那么对我来说，那是一个 If I'd have retired last year, I'd have 华丽的转身，头顶第曼联20冠，功成身退。

那样的话所有的事情看起来都会很顺利 and everything would have been rosy.
但是生活总不是像你预期的那样发展的 But life isn't like that.
诚然，这里当然有些问题你不能太展开讲 Yeah, there's definitely an issue where you can't be too open,
然后你看其他体育运动或许 whereas other sports, 或许不会有这样的例子 that probably isn't the case.
你会被新闻处的人告知什么该说什么不该说 You're guided by the press office, really, on what not to say.
你看这就是个例子。

(MALE REPORTER SPEAKING)
莫耶斯：

目前为止，我们表现的都很好 It's been very good for us so far...
一个缺乏欧冠联赛经验的主教练 ...a very inexperienced manager in the Champions League.
但是我们做的还是很不错的， But we've done well, and then 接下来我们将和拜仁来场硬仗 we'll be at the ultimate test with Bayern.
正如你所见到的，哥当球员的机会是越来越少了

我确实不知道 I don't know.
要不放学我给你说怎么样，你别走。

(笑CRY)
我觉得作为一个球员， I mean, yeah, of course, 每一场比赛的机会都要争取 as a player you want to play all the time.
我的意思是，我上一次出场大概是 I mean, the last time I played 六周或者七周以来的第一次出场 was probably the first time
但是我们在每个位置上有着很多的选择余地 in six or seven weeks, but we've got a lot of players to choose from
时刻准备着 who are always ready to play, 这就是你需要去做的事情 and that's what you've gotta do.
记者：

累成狗了 Nearly died.
一切顺利吧

好的，再见

他早遛了 Yeah, he's all gone.
有个声音在脑海里回想，在问自己，是否可以 A bit naughty, really, asking 从事曼联的主教练 if I'm going to take over from the manager.
那里有个记者最后问起 There was one right at the end
我和莫耶斯的吵架 where he asked about us falling out.

但是你只如果输球了，那么你肯定得处理一些事情 But if you lose a game, then you're obviously going to have to handle the stick
因为人们不希望看到球队输球 because you're not expected to lose games,
因为赢球才是曼联的传统 you're not expected to lose so many games at Man United.
所以，主教练明白这个的。

但这不是问题。

我确实不知道自己会不会从事主教练的工作 I honestly don't know if I'm going to go into management or not.
不过我已经做好了最好的准备，把我最好的一面展现出来 I've prepared myself for it as best I can,
这就是你能做的。

但是问题就是，现代足球发展到今天， The problem is, obviously these days, 主教练的位置 that managers
一般不会持续太久的时间 don't last very long.

你会看到主教练们每天都在改变自己适应大环境 You see managers changing all the time, 但是他们仍旧要面临很多困难 and still they come back for more,
这种喧闹使他们现在所必须面对 and it's that buzz that they get 而下课以后又无比怀念的 and they really miss it when they're away,
所以这对你开启教练生涯的启示 so it might be a case of you start managing, 或者你成为主教练以后 or you become a manager
你绝对会爱上这种感觉，哪怕你还没有取得成功。

你会想着再来，想要更多。

因为，很显然如果你喜欢足球， because, obviously like football, 你将会从犯过的错误中学到很多 you learn from your mistakes
然后你会变得更加的强大 and you get better and better.
或者可以这么说，这是你成功晋身主教练的基石。

如果你不知道该怎么做的更好，看懂没？

你今晚不会从我这里问到太多 You won't get a lot out of me tonight 因为我今晚心情不好 because I am grumpy.
我还没找到比赛的感觉呢 I didn't really get into the game.
我找到了自己的方向，我认为我们都找到了 I found myself, well, I think we all did, 今晚大部分时间都处于防守的状态。

所以明显我的优势是，当我拿到球时， so obviously my main asset is when I get 会比一直防守要好 on the ball, rather than defending.
但是我确实没有得到太多的机会 I didn't really get a chance.
要么是位置太靠前要么。

反正就是拿不到球 Just didn't get the ball.
作为一个死忠， As a fan, this season obviously 这个赛季发展的可是和我预想的不一样 hasn't went the way I was hoping it would.
有些担忧 I was fearing...
我之前觉得老爷子的离开或多 I thought there was always going to be 或多或少会给这支球队造成影响 a little bit of a drop off from when Fergie left.
但是我从来没有预料到时这么大的下滑。

18年来第一次无缘欧冠联赛 where they're not going to qualify for Champions League.
瑞恩：

缺席欧冠，这对曼联来说必然是一个艰难的时刻 You're out of the Champions League.

因为那是我们那个赛季唯一为之努力奋斗的目标 after that because that was the only thing we were going for, really.
缺席欧冠对我来将会是持续几天的噩梦。

然后渐渐的从失败的阴影中走出来 gradually you just snap out of it,
因为你还是想参与其中， because you wanna be involved, 想接着上场比赛 you wanna play.
我想强调的是，我现在在理疗椅上 On top of all this, I'm on the treatment bed,
我得冷敷而且还得被抽检兴奋剂 I'm getting iced and I get chosen for doping,
所以这些是今晚最重要的事情 so that just tops it all off for tonight.
所以我必须去而且对着一个小杯子撒尿， So I had to go and piss in a cup 有的时候哥还憋不出来 when I don't really want to,
你看看我今晚该是有多糟糕 and that just tops my evening off, really.
你是不是和我最亲，狗哥？

是不是？

你咋这么懒？

看了你是吃的太好了你！

来，有摄像机拍着呢，配合一下？

乖 Ooh.
感觉很棒吧？

什么？

肯定进了,没问题！

瑞恩：

然后周一放假， then Monday we had the day off, 所以我决定和我的小伙伴来打高尔夫 so I was playing golf with my mate.
我那时在和卡梅隆打高尔夫 I was playing golf with Cameron.
我确实很享受之前那一杆 Yeah, I'm losing now, after that shot.
是什么？

卡梅隆：

瑞恩：

看到很多人发短信打电话问我 and it was just off different people, 粗啥大事了？

到底咋回事？

你懂的，哥不玩微博， And I'm not on Twitter, 也不玩微信什么的 I'm not on social media of any kind.
哥书读的少，所以也很少读报纸的。

我确实不知道怎么了 "I don't know what's going on."
然后，谣言就满天飞了 And, um, apparently that's when all the rumours started
坊间流传说莫耶斯就要下课了 that the manager was going to leave.
(INAUDIBLE)
我就知道如果曼联高层撤掉莫耶斯的话 I knew that if they sacked David Moyes 吉格斯会接手 that Ryan would take over for the period
最起码带队踢完这个赛季 to the end of the season as a minimum.

他毫无疑问就是那个人 He was the natural person that was there,
更衣室里的权威，在队里每个人都尊敬他 an authority in the changing room, respected by everybody in the club
而且我也很高兴看到瑞恩得到了这个机会 and I was delighted that Ryan was getting an opportunity
带队完成那个赛季最后的四场比赛 for the last four weeks of the season.
尼玛，累死爹了。

总BOSS三德子通知我他们已经 Ed Woodward informed me 决定让莫耶斯走人了 that they were letting the manager go,
我听到这个消息的时候并不高兴 which was obviously sad to hear
因为你知道的，大家都混口饭吃，都不容易啊 because you don't want anyone （霸气侧漏啊） ever to lose their job.
完了三德子问我愿不愿意接手球队 And then he went on to ask me if I'd like to look after the team
带队打完余下的比赛。

我绝对会认真逾越的完成组织上交代给我的任务 and was obviously happy to do and thrilled to do.
这绝对疯狂的一天啊 It's obviously been a crazy day, 我都迫不及待的想上任了 and I've not really probably sat...
抽时间冷静下来去思考一下该怎么做一个主教练 Had time to sit down and think about it,
也许这种打击就来了， and maybe it will hit me later in the week 或者以后打击就来了，谁知道呢 or maybe it'll hit me
要么在开新闻发布会的时候， when I get into the press conference 要么是在老特拉福德比赛的时候 or at Old Trafford for the game.
不知道，但是我已经不淡定了 I don't know, but I'm obviously excited.
这就像各种情绪混合交织在一起 It's just a mixture of different feelings,
而你在风暴的中心，这个。

从未有过的人生经历 It's a strange experience.
我也许不是很喜欢做教练 I might not enjoy it, 也许打不出很好的成绩 might not get the right results,
我也许不是曼联最正确的选择， I might not be the right man, 我也许还没准备好 I might not be ready.
这所有的所有，在我接到通知的那一刻 All them things are just 的已经变得不重要了 up in the air at the moment,
然后我就会慢慢周到上面那些问题的答案， and we'll soon find out a lot of the answers 让事实说话！

我不需要被外界所看好或看低， I don't need to be set expectations 因为我知道自己要做什么 because I've got my own expectations.
还剩下4场比赛 Four games for Man United, 3场在主场作战，赢,就一个字。

我想从92班的兄弟们中找些人过来搭把手， You wanted someone from the class of '92, 他们是真正传承曼联血脉， someone who understood the DNA,
文化，感受到俱乐部的生息，让曼联回到 the culture, the heartbeat of the club, to step back in there
过去那个曼联的人。

曼联的鲜红战袍究竟意味着什么 and the players what Manchester United is all about.
那是在比赛中的所向披靡，不断进攻 It's about width, it's about fearless attacking,
那是曼联死忠（西看台）发出的不断进攻的号角 it's about attack, attack, attack, at the Stretford end,
所有这一切都在吉格斯身上体现出来 and all those qualities that Ryan Giggs embodied,
所以我认为他是最佳的那个人选 so I thought he was a perfect choice.
他之前从来没有执教过球队， He's obviously not managed a team before, 但是没有人比他更懂这支曼联 but he knows Manchester United
没有人！

曼联已经是他身体的一部分了， He loves Man United probably more 别人很难像他这样 than anyone that's there.
征战沙场这么多年，吉格斯早已名声在外 He's got the respect from
这么多年和他一起踢过球的球员， the professionals that 无不对他赞誉有加 he's played with over the years.
他当主教练会变得铁面无私起来 He's got that ruthless streak 这是主教练 that I think managers,
尤其是一个好的主教练所必备的素质 good managers, really need.
我认为他有着一个成功主教练的一切素质 I think he has exactly what it takes to be successful in management.
他会很快的进入教练这个角色的 Getting the coaching role really quick
当然有些事情还是没有准备 is something that maybe you are not prepared for,
但是我认为他有着非比寻常的意志力 but I think he's got the special mentality.

在过去的30年里，曼联队里没有一个球员可以 he knows Man United more than 比瑞恩吉格斯更加了解曼联 any other player in the last 30 years.
想达到那种程度是非常困难的 It's always difficult to take that step.
菲利普：

所以那天他得到这份球员兼主教练的工作时 so the day he got the job on obviously a part

我都不知道自己会发生什么了！

他足够好吗？

他知道怎么不知技战术吗？

瑞恩为大场面而生 Well, Ryan's handled playing on the big stage,
过去的20年里，他很牛逼，所有困难一一化解 he's handled everything that's thrown at him over the last 20 years,
所以为什么他不能当一个主教练呢？

这可能有些出人意料，但是我觉得曼联 It might be fantasy, but I think this club
正是一个让奇迹发生的地方 is built on a little bit of fantasy.
球员们给我个便签，问我你会到哪里停车？

毫无疑问，主教练的停车位：

小斯：

他已经拿到欧洲俱乐部教练A级证 He's done his A licence, 现在他正在考取专业教练证 he's doing his Pro licence.
他是一个很有大局观的人 He's a very level

我从来没见过他对自己放松下来 I've not seen him ever come unstuck
或者感觉到任何的压力。

他总是把事情都处理的很好，可以很好的适应。

我认为这是吉格斯身上最优秀的一点。

泰山崩于前面不改色。

瑞恩：

是因为我知道在我们更衣室里有 I knew what good players 一群顶级的球员 we had in the dressing room,
而且这对我来说是一个千载难逢的好机会 and it was obviously a great chance for me.
仅仅四场比赛， It was four games, 放手去做就好了，没什么好顾虑的 and there was nothing to lose
谁来拯救曼联于水火之中？

老爷子：

所以他们也必然属于曼联未来的一部分 quite rightly they should be part of the future of the club,
这对于我来说已经足够了。

我告诉他们,你已经得到机会去得到自己做 We told them, "You've got to 主教练的机会 get your coaching badges.
你已经经历了一起必要的历练和准备 "You've got to get through all that procedure
去挑战你人生中最大的挑战，去做一个球队的主教练 "and prepare yourself for the biggest challenge of your life, being a coach."
(INAUDIBLE)
瑞恩：

于是我就会想，我干了些什么事情？

然后我会告诉我的球员发什么了什么 I then spoke to the players to tell them what's happening.
(RYAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
你知道的，他要出席，就在那间屋子。

我不知道你是怎么学到的 I don't know how you get that.
我的意思，王老吉做起来和 I mean, Sir Alex had it in a huge way, 老爷子是一样一样的 Giggsy's got it.
也许伟大的人有共同之处吧 Maybe it comes through greatness.
也许他就是知道自己该怎么做 Maybe that's just how you get it, and he's certainly got that.
瑞恩：

我传承了一支星光璀璨的顶级球队 I was inheriting a team that were full of stars and full of quality.
我得试着去为下一场比赛做训练准备 I've gotta try and prepare training.
当然了我也想尽可能得到帮助 Of course I wanted as much help as I could get,
所以菲尔和巴特已经在位了 so Phil and Nicky were already here, 我告诉了他们我的想法 so I'd spoke to them
当然还有老斯，不得不说，我欣赏 and, yeah, obviously 球员时代的他（我也是） I respect Scholesy as a player
作为朋友我也佩服他独特的世界观 and as a person and I respect his view.
所以我尽快拉他过来帮忙 I wanted to get him in as quickly as possible.
斯科尔斯：

也没什么就祝他一切顺利之类的 just wishing him good luck, 然后大概5到10分钟过后 and five or ten minutes later
他打过来问我有没有兴趣一起玩几场 he gave me a call to see if I'd be interested in coming
帮忙训练一下球队 to training for a couple of weeks.
我想92届同学聚会怎么不去呢你说是不是？

所以我认为这个提议棒极了 I thought it was brilliant.
那感觉就像beyond乐队重组了 It was like one of the great bands reforming.
你会迫不及待的去想看见他们， You want to see them 回想去过去上学路上的场景 go back on the road again.
这是曼联史上难得一见的"曼联"教练组 It was quite a staff team they would have had there.
我觉得这会让人们重新燃起对曼联希望，让 I think it was just a reminder that Manchester United
曼联回到正轨上去。

一扫莫耶斯执教时期的阴霾 to take them forward from such a difficult period under David Moyes.
还记得那天第一次看见斯科尔斯，巴特，内维尔 Coming out and seeing Scholesy, Butty, Nev
吉格斯在一起的时候 and Giggsy on the first day was...
画面美的我不敢直视啊 It was a pretty special sight, really.
瑞恩：

一脚或者两脚出球 one and two touch, 敏锐的反应力 get the sharpness in the legs,
当然了乐趣也是少不了的 also a bit of fun.
就像一直控球没有人可以把球从你脚下抢走 It was just a keep ball, and no

比赛不是经常中断 The ball didn't go out of play,
这才是曼联该踢的赏心悦目的比赛 and it was just brilliant to watch.
我坐在巴特旁边问他 I sat next to Butty and I went, "Butty, what 巴特，你觉得还有什么要注意的？

这训练质量碉堡了！

分组对抗，很多进球，很多射门 Short games, lots of goals, lots of shots
当然德赫亚们该骂我了:

因为我觉得连费迪南德都进球了 because some of the shots that were going in I think even Rio scored.
(笑 cry)
菲利普：

瑞恩没有态度的教练经历。

but in terms of Man United experience, 但是在讲到关于曼联的经历方面 397 我认为这是很重要的。

你现在看我们几个加起来都有超过100年 And we've probably got over 100 years' experience of being involved
在曼联效力的经验了， at this football club, so it's 所以呢这个不光是我们搞聚会 not as if we're all just best mates
我们会认真对待自己的工作的 having a laugh.

没有人比瑞恩更加认真的对待接手曼联这件事情 There's nobody more serious than Ryan.
里奥.

和我们一起开玩笑的老兄的角色中 having a laugh with the lads, joking and stuff, messing around,
迅速转变成一个权威的主教练角色 and has to really cut off from the rest of us now and become a manager so quick,
他不仅要选定首发，而且还要得那些 and then he's got to pick a team and disappoint people
过去的一起比赛的队友 that he's been teammates with.
我相信这段经历会让他明白他 This period here will tell him 以后到底适不适合教练这个职业 whether he seesa future in management for himself.
他喜欢当教练吗？

他觉得他能够胜任这个角色吗？

我现在做的和我之前完成的事情 What I do and what I have done 就是踢球这么简单 is play football.
感觉这是自然而然的。

就是那种完全的不同的感觉 but it's just totally different, 让你立马就有一种 and instantly you just
高大上的感觉。

工作人员吗等等 Not just the players, but the staff as well.
能再说一边吗？

去酒店？

让我想想，6点半，老特拉福德。

坦白讲，我觉得吧， Honestly, I thought, 他会慢慢的厌恶这个的 "He's going to hate this now,
5点结束

也许我会一直待到8点 Might as well stay till 8:

我过去很尊敬主教练们 I had respect for mangers before, 对于那些资历颇深的教练们来说 but managers who've been
你就可以看到 in the game years and years, you can just see what...
他们必须要忍受的烦心事，但是同时 The hassles that they have to 你也会明白他们 put up with, but also you see why
为什么一直在努力，因为那种在训练场上 they keep coming back, because of the enjoyment of going out
指挥的感觉是你从来没有过的 onto the training pitch, the different feelings that you have,
但这确实是一个非常熬人的活啊 but it's a tough, tough job.
在那四天以后 And that's after four days.
不，这是在媒体简报 No, that was my media briefing.
这些都是关于最近的五场球 This is all the stats on the last 谁在踢 five games, who's been involved,
谁没有出场 who's not been.
这是一个关于季中 This is the schedule
和赛季准备期的训练课程计划表 of the training sessions from one of the seasons and the pre

我觉得当教练的话比球员爽啊。

所以，你懂：

比克利夫还多 It was more the Cliff.
他如此的优秀，面对困难从未退缩 He never escaped because he was such a great player,
当他犯下错位或者踢不好时 and when he made mistakes or he had a bad game or whatever,
我相信他会很快的调整自己 I never believe in letting things pass.
这是能给人带来希望 It's about carrying an expectation.
这就像记录我去感谢莫耶斯给我第一次执教的机会 Just like to go on record to thank David for giving me my first chance in coaching.
人这一辈子总有些人有些事得去铭记的 It's something that I'll always remember.

执教这支我毕生支持， how proud I am to be managing the club that I've supported
而且在过去的四分之一个世纪里都效力的球队 all my life and I've been associated with for
大概是我职业生涯中最光辉荣耀的时刻了 25, 26 years, so it's probably the proudest moment of my career.
我都迫不及待等着周六5点半在主场和 I can't wait for Saturday to come, 诺维奇的比赛了 5:

那会是石破惊天的时刻 I know it'll be rocking, 我知道所有的球迷都会支持我们 I know the fans will be behind us.
我知道球员们求战心切 I know the players can't wait, 教练组的成员们迫不及待 I know my staff can't wait.
我也是，赶快到来吧 And I can't wait.

我要我所有的球员在场上充满激情，速度 I want the players to play with passion,
速度，活力，勇敢 speed, tempo, be brave,
创造力。

曼联队员所应该具有的。

最重要的是，享受比赛，乐在其中 but most of all, enjoy it.
(MALE REPORTER 1 SPEAKING)
你知道吗，我已经得到机会展示自己 Well, I've got a chance to show
是否可以胜任教练这个职位了 what I can do, what I'm capable of as a manager
在很短的时间内，全神贯注到教练的这个角色中去 in a short space of time, and that's my focus.
接下来是另一个谈话 After that is another conversation.
(MALE REPORTER 2 SPEAKING)
哥刚和自己须签了5年的合同 I've just given myself a five

(笑CRY)
这个感觉就像自己可以HOLD住全场 so, yeah, I'm using my power while I can.
明天最大的担心是什么？

应对不同的场面 for different scenarios.
这还让不让人睡觉了 It's a nightmare.
我已经选定了10个球员 I've got 10 players.
他们可以在场上踢7个不同的位置 Ten players for seven places.
还有3个首发没有定下来 So three are going to miss out, 谁让这是第一场比赛呢 which, on your first game...
其实说白了，曼联队没有一个球员 The thing is, there's no player 应该被排除在首发之外。

然后你会不停的去思考， And you're constantly thinking, 哪些球员打替补 right, what's the subs going to be?
遇到不同情况的预案是什么 What happens if this happens?
总之就是脑子里不停的转 And it's just non

但是作为主教练，你不能不去考虑 As a manager, you just can't.
这才四天，哥瞬间就苍老了许多 I'm just slowly seeing myself age in four days.
(有木有)
瑞恩：

我们已经在主教练的办公室个待了这么这么长时间 We've stayed here a long time.

所以这让人感觉有些惊讶 so it was a bit of a shock.
当我们去前台的时候 All our envelopes are laid out 所有关于球迷的来信已经放在那里了 as we come in on reception.
我过去找写给我的，可是没发现 I went to get it, mine wasn't there,
这时候在这里工作的海伦把我的信交给我 and then Helen, who works here, actually handed me mine.
你现在已经不是普通求原谅 "No, you're not in your normal room.

这感觉有些囧 So, yeah, it was a bit strange.
嗯，还不错的夜晚 Yeah, it's a good night.

吃了点好东西 You have a bit of food, 和教练组们一起喝了杯小酒 have a glass of wine with the staff,
总之就是小小的这么放松一下呗 and just, yeah, chillskies.
大部分工作已经完成了 Most of the hard work's done now 现在就剩下一些细节再完善一下 and, yeah, it's just the little details
就等明天比赛了，明天一切准备就绪 I'll do tomorrow, and then we're all set.
老斯：

奖杯比其他人都要多 trophies than anybody.

也一定知道通过球员们这一周的训练 he will know exactly what he wants from his players throughout the week
该怎么在周六的比赛中发挥的更好 to then be ready to perform on the Saturday.
阅读比赛的视角不同了 Can just see Old Trafford in the distance.
还是有一些紧张的，当然了， Yeah, little bit nervous.

温特：

王老吉已教练身份踏入球场， the Norwich game, 历史性的时刻 when the Manchester United coach pulled up,
他第一个走出球员大巴，和每个人亲切握手 Ryan Giggs walked off the coach shaking hands with
他看起来确实像个曼联的主教练 everyone, beaming.

他穿了一件曼联的上衣，真心炫酷 He had the blazer on.

曼联又回到正轨上来了 "we're back in good hands again."
(INAUDIBLE)
我已经解说了他13次英超的颁奖典礼 I've commentated on most of the trophy lifts
每一次你都不经深呼吸 in his 13 Premier League titles, and each time it's like a sharp intake
查看一下自己的笔记，然后自问， of breath, check your notes, 居然这么多？

他真的赢得了这么多奖杯？

我希望他一起顺利，希望他可以在曼联 games for the club, and I wish him well.

执教1000场的不死 1,000 games for the club.

其他92届的几个伙计们 Ryan and the other lads from '92, '93
在为曼联贡献着自己的一份力量 have a great part to play 贡献着自己的价值 in the future of the club,
我很赞同，让我们拭目以待吧 I really do.

瑞恩：

但这些可都是主教练该干的活 and it's all the stuff that managers have to do.
你得选个球员一起和你去出席新闻发布会 You have to choose a player to go and speak to the press,
然后你得自己给自己准备发布会的材料 you have to do your own press stuff, 你是整个球队的象征 you name the team.
记者会通常会持续1小时左右 And then it was a long hour,
因为我过去基本上是用这个时间来做准备活动 because normally I'm out there warming up, 为上场而热身了 preparing for the game.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
这真是一件自豪的事情 I'm immensely proud.

12，13，14开始就一起踢球了 played since the age of 12,13,14, 现在又聚首一起辅佐瑞恩干好主教练 and for Ryan to be manager,
这对他是多大的优待啊：

你知道历史上有多少人曾经执教过曼联吗？

瑞恩：

该是什么样就是什么样了。

让他们放心大胆的去比赛 and play and just leave it to them.
从热身场地过来，我觉得我得说点什么了 Come in from the warm

我说：

我仅仅告诉他们在更衣室的地位 I just told them what quality they had in the dressing room.
你的能力我清楚，相信自己，好好踢！

这个失败的赛季都已经这样了 It's been a crap season, a frustrating season,
大家都能感觉出来。

可以球迷在夏天振臂高呼的事情 in the summer cheering about.
你懂的 And, uh...
还是那句话，享受足球，乐在其中。

曼联从不缺乏对胜利的渴望 Manchester United don't play friendly games.
在这家具乐部的字典里没有失败二字 There's just not a thing called friendly games.
每个人都去追着胜利 Everyone wants to beat them.
瑞恩：

调整自己，为比赛做准备 You're preparing yourself for the game.
作为教练，有些事情也不好控制 As a manager, it's out of your hands.
你已经做了所有你该做的事情，然后 You've done all you can, 你已经没有那么多要做的了 and there's not a lot you can do now.
所以走出球员通道的时候是有些紧张的 So it was a nervous walk.
(人群欢呼)
(点赞)
那种全场的热烈欢呼 The ovation that I got was just...
让我头皮发麻不能自已 Yeah, it was goose bumps,
那是我这一生永远也无法忘怀的时刻 and it was a moment that I'll never, ever forget.
当看到吉格斯衣着正式的以教练 It was weird to see Giggsy 的身份踏进老特拉福德还是有些不太习惯的 walk out in the blazer as manager.
这是多么大的荣耀啊。

被他热爱所拥戴 times that he's done, being loved by the fans like he's loved,
年近40，以教练身份迈入球场 and then walking out when he's 40 years old,
接受他过去曾经从球迷那里 getting the reaction that 得过到的热情欢呼 he's got from the fans.
他一度哽咽 You could see him get choked up.
在这个特殊的时刻 And that was a special moment.
那毫无疑问是我职业生涯最光辉的时刻， It was the proudest moment of my career, without a shadow of
因为全场震耳欲聋的欢呼声 a doubt, because of the reception that I got and
球迷们对我的无限支持和鼓励 the excitement around the ground and the buzz,
我恨不得比赛马上开始 and I just couldn't then wait for the game to start.
(口哨声)
我不知道是不是太过情绪化的缘故 I don't know if it was all the emotion, 或者这周 and maybe we trained
的训练量有些大，造成节奏缓慢 a little bit too much during the week that it was a bit of a slow start.
在半场休息的时候， It was half

你们的节奏太慢了 "You're playing too slow.
每次把速度提起来的时候 "Every time you play quick, 就让人感觉要进球了 you look like you're gonna score.
你在尝试要加快节奏，提速 "You look like you're gonna do something, so quicken the tempo up.
多一些一脚或者两脚出球， "Take one or two touches 我们就能拿下比赛 on the ball and we'll be OK."
(欢呼)
我要求他们给诺维奇施加压力 I wanted them to press Norwich 让诺维奇也攻出来 and get the crowd up.
我也选了替补球员，这下替补球员 I also picked a team where the subs could have an impact
可以在局面僵持不小的时候改变战局 if it went well, and it couldn't have gone any better.
我带了马塔，小豌豆 I brought Juan on, and Chicha, 他们都没有让我失望 Ash as well, and they all made an impact.
你会很乐意看到这种情况，因为你知道吗， 在曼联 It was great to see, because it wasn't easy
作为教练选择球员不是一件轻松的事情， 他们都是顶级球员 leaving players of that quality out.
(人群欢呼)
温特：

因为我们记忆中的曼联又回来了 It was just good to see Manchester United get their swagger back.
来，干杯 Thank you, cheers.
瑞恩：

很累很累 after the game, we were shattered.

你就会明白这对我们来讲是 emotionally because it was 一个非常重要的时刻 a big moment for all four of us.
必须要坚持下去 We had to deliver.
不，我是真心累成狗了。

（缓口气）
这活不是人干的。

我现在才能体会到教练员的不易啊 And I've got, obviously, massive respect for any manager
之前很难认识到他们的工作的另外一面的 because I haven't seen the other side
就像过去的这一周。

确实很难，而且得耗费大量的时间 it's hard, it's time

脑子总得 You're always
不停的转。

有没有什么遗漏的？

作为主教练你肯定需要帮助 And you need help in this position.
显然，我才上任5天 Obviously, like I say, I've just been in it five days.
当我走进乔治（吉格斯在英国沃思利的餐厅）的时候 Yeah, I walked into George's, got a round 得到大家的热情拥戴 of applause and a standing ovation.
(点赞点赞)
我估计他们要让我给免单呢 I think they were expecting a free round, 你想这可能吗:

哈哈，这个感觉真的很棒的。

喝着小酒聊聊放松下来 just relaxed with my family and friends.
你和蛋糕都很漂亮

这是昨天做的母亲节的蛋糕，还不错。

母亲节除了我之外你们什么也得不到：

说的好像我们没给你准备似的 That's like we didn't get her anything.
明显啊！

我们是不是把你妈惹怒了？

哼哼，乖女儿去贺卡去 Go and get the card.
别拿，记者在呢，不好意思阿 No, don't get the card.
为什么不？

几张我最丑的照片 his phone and looks for the worst pictures,
然后做成贺卡的。

实话，母亲节的贺卡？

(笑cry)
我老婆总是很支持我 Stacey's always been supportive toward me,
她不了解足球也不关心足球 and hasn't got a clue about football and she doesn't care.
只要和足球沾边的事情她都不关心 She doesn't want to know anything about football,
其实对我来说这是一件好事 which is good.
没什么比这个更好的了 Wouldn't have it any other way.
斯泰西：

然后他尽力给我们说 and he walked through the door and he just said,
他要当曼联的主教练了 "I'm going to be the manager,"
我们都笑了 and we both laughed.
然后我问，真的，你当教练？

然后他很严肃的说，你老公就是这么叼！

我在想，他怎么能当教练呢？

我有点担心他因为我认为 I did worry a little bit because I just thought,
我去，这下所有的锅得我老公背了 "Oh, God, here we go, all the pressure, stress."
但是，坦白讲，目前感觉还不错 But, to be fair, it hasn't been that bad.
唯一改变的事情就是他不会坐那里看一下午电视了 The only change is, he's not sat on his arse watching telly all afternoon.
瑞恩：

看电视，下班回家，放松 anyway, just get home from training, you relax.
沙发上这么一躺。

我喜欢开心词典一类的节目

Eggheads和Chase "Eggheads is on, or the Chase.

选手要把每道题都得回答正确 Then you answer all the questions, and get them all right,
答错一道可就没机会了 and then you get one wrong and you go, "Oh!"
瑞恩：

我忘记CHASE和EGGheads是哪个台了 I forgot about The Chase and Eggheads.
单向乐队的电影

我已经看了有28遍了，而且还要再看 I watched it 28 times and counting.
出自于歌曲《What Makes You Beautiful》单向乐队 # You light up my life like nobody...

老爸应该是world

哈哈，你等着哪天我写信问问他们 Might write in to One Direction, 能不能把这个歌歌词改一下 ask if they'll change it.
为什么啊 Why'?
因为我觉得老爸的这个版本更好 Because I think mine are better, my lines.
老爸你开撒玩笑呢你！

老婆孩子热炕头对我来说 Coming home to Stace and the kids has always been
总是一种快乐的时光，不用去想工作压力 sort of escapism, really, from
做的不好的地方，哪怕当你清醒过来的时候 the pressures or the disappointments or even bringing you back down to Earth.
家总是你心灵的港湾 It's always the place where all these things happen.
(BOTH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
远离镁光灯，家对我来说 Away from the spotlight, that's your safe haven and
就是天堂，在家里你可以完完全全的放松下来 the place where you just feel comfortable
无论工作的时候发生过什么 and relaxed no matter what's happening in football.
他们看完了整场比赛 They've been watching the whole game,
你妈可自豪了。

嗯。

她会告诉你把谁谁拿下 She was telling you to take somebody off.
哈哈？

她会说，你说吉格斯执教的时候拿手机着没， 赶紧打个电话。

我说，你个疯婆子，不管他拿不拿电话你也不能打啊 So I went, "No, no, no, he won't have it.

让谁谁下来，谁谁会终结比赛 "Take such and such off, and such and such ended up scoring two goals."
妈精神真好 Yeah.
她还是退休呆家里比较好，不能当教练 So she won't make a manager.
瑞恩：

有一天你如果熬成教练的话你就会发现 "Wait until all you lot are managers and you'll find out
选择首发和替补是多么的困难。

我那时想，关我什么事。

你知道吧，就像我女儿出生的过程一样 You know, it's like having your first baby.
你对她的到来做好了一切的准备 You can prep as much as you can,
但是只有她真正来到这个世界上时 but until it comes down to actually
你才会真正的感受到做父母的不易和乐趣 living it, day in, day out, 这些是你没办法提前准备的 you can never prepare for it.
上一周我说过，这周周一训练 I said last week that I was gonna start training on the Monday,
但是事实情况是，巴特周一早上来我办公室说 but it was actually Nicky, Nicky Butt come into the office Monday morning and said,
哥，你是不是这周不安排训练了？

我说，撒意思？

他说，我的意思是 And he went, "No, I think
如果训练的时候你就指挥， "it's better if you're just seen out there as the leader,
不要和球员一起踢，那样的话会更好一点 "and you're not getting involved in training.
如果有个球员把你惹毛了，你咋办？

这确实是个好建议，所以我决定还是做自己该做的 lt was a really good point, so I stood away
希望当个主教练 and really have just been a manager,
而不是个球员 rather than a player, which I expected to be,
所以这是一个很好的建议 so it was good advice and
我一定会这么做的 definitely the right thing to do.
早上好 Morning.
换个衣服 Get changed now,
然后吃个早饭 and then just going for breakfast.

吐司，橙汁，咖啡 toast, orange juice, coffee.
早上吃好些，精神一整天 Big breakfast.

每天在卡林顿带队训练感觉就像天天中彩票啊 You win the lottery every day when you're coming training at a place like this.
这里的硬件首屈一指，员工爱岗敬业 The facilities are great, the people are great,
勇于挑战 the challenge is there,
再没有比这个地方更好的了 and it's a great place to come in and work.
小伙伴们都去哪了？

不带这么玩的啊！

他们现在正在一起喝茶，喝咖啡呢：

瑞恩：

但是我认为他就是个当教练的料子 I think he was born to be a coach.
他的学识，他的热情，已经他的智慧 His knowledge, his enthusiasm.

我会有的时候说我的一些想法 I would sort of say what I wanted, and he was the voice
而他正在关注于训练，然后他会给我递一份 on the training pitch, and he would put up
训练计划。"我们该怎们做的最好？" the session plan, "Right, how can we get the best of that?"
我们对于现在这支曼联该朝哪个方向发展 We've all got the same views 是有着共识的 of how we want this Man United team
那也许就是我们骨子里流淌的曼联血脉吧 to play, and it probably dates back to when
我们都知道曼联意味着什么， we was players here and 这么多年，从未改变 the styles that we were brought up on.
快攻，打出精气神，团结一致，知难而进 You know, fast

尼克老兄给我们带来了他丰富的经验，学识 Nicky's the lad who brings, obviously, his experience, his know

他同时也是那种可以和主教练产生共鸣的人 but he's also that sort of soundboard
你知道你可以毫无保留的信任他 a manager has, where you know you can trust him.
如果我犯错了，或者说错话了 He'll tell me, without even hesitation,
他会毫不犹豫的指出来 if I'm talking rubbish or I've not done something right.
巴特：

这个过程是非常锻炼人，非常愉快的。

我很喜欢 It's enjoyable for me.
我们兄弟几个认识这么多年了，了解彼此 Boys, we know each other like brothers, really, so it's quite
所以一起工作起来真的很容易 easy to work together.
瑞恩：

没什么，就是喜欢和他一起踢球。

和他一起训练一起比赛总是那么乐趣横生。

老斯：

我经历了自从我成为职业球员以来 have probably been some of the most enjoyable times I've had
最开心的时光 even as a footballer,
看着大伙都在一起 seeing all the players getting involved with the boxes, the possession,
认认真真的训练 just basically being out there kicking a ball again.
瑞恩：

为周六比赛做准备 getting ready for the game Saturday.

了关于这周的一个清晰的计划 a clear plan for that week.
训练，调整球员们的身体状态 Prepare training, get the best out of the players physically
为周末的比赛的比赛做准备 early on in the week, possession games,
加快训练节奏，加入射门练习 speed training with a bit of shooting maybe involved,
然后在比赛之前，慢慢把量减下来 and then towards the game, just taper down a little bit
然后去准备一些针对性的战术 and then also you might want to do something tactically.
简报。

能稍等一会不，给老伙计们一些时间 Can I have five minutes, just to give the lads the programmes
因为今年有些不同了 because it's a bit different this year?
你可以给伙计们找几个休息室吗 Well, can you do a couple of laps with the lads?
就几间就好 Couple of box

瑞恩：

你觉得训练达到你预期的目标了吗 Did the training that you just put on
get what you wanted?
然后当你回看录像的时候 And then when you watch the videos,
你得依靠分析师帮你分析 obviously you need to rely on the analysts.
所以说这里真不错， It's a great place to come in and work,
能在这里工作这么多年实在是我的荣幸 and I've been lucky enough to do it for a long, long time.
感觉太棒了 It's brilliant.
hi好萌，很高兴见到你

(ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
谢谢，干杯

导演：

好的。

可以做个双手合十的收拾吗？

好， OK.

(过的好吗)
好好练练 Done this one 100 times.
欢迎来到梦剧场

(DIRECTOR SPEAKING)
(RYAN SPEAKING)
你让我签的越多，我的签的名字就会越短 My autographs get shorter the more things you sign.
你看刚开始还是比较长的 It starts off long, 然后就越来越短啦 and then gets shorter and shorter.
你上次也这样吗？

你能不能把这些都签了？

瑞恩：

这取决于不同的场合。

黑贝，黑贝

手都酸了

你看看 Yeah.
看起来很不错，是不是？

为啥？

你妹，哥用泰语写的

瑞恩：

我不相信

你知道的哥，为了俱乐部甘愿奉献自己 You know me, I love the club.
真的很难吗？

也就一般吧 No.
你肯定会奔溃的！

(鬼魅一笑)
瑞恩：

我在选择球员出战的问题上又犯难了 I've got the headache of picking the team
不好处理啊 and leaving players out,
有的时候你都不知道该怎么和那些进 and sometimes you haven't got 不了大名单的球员解释 an excuse for leaving players out.
可供选择的队员太多了 There's just too many players, and it's 这是一件让我犯难 another thing that I'm finding tough to do,
但是又必须完成的事情 but it's gotta be done.
我想说的是，范加尔有着极高声誉 Yeah, I mean, he's got a brilliant reputation,
是一个成功的主帅 a successful manager, 但是我想强调的是 but my main concentration is
明天和桑德兰的比赛已经后面的两场球 on Sunderland tomorrow and then, after that, the remaining two games.
我已经不断的在思考 I've got a lot to think about.

把我自己换上场（他确实做到了！

就像我说的，到时候看。

我现在首要的任务就是拿下比赛 But my main priority is winning the games.
关于我出场，或者其他什么的，我们拭目以待吧 And is it me playing?

这周每天早上 Every morning this week...

我开车去上班 I've been driving into training,
我还得给卡梅隆打电话 and I'll ring Cameron.

然后他会问我，你干嘛呢？

大早上的还让不让人睡觉了？

我是即当爹又当妈 "I'm doing this, I'm doing that."
你认识到你现在统帅着 "Do you realise you're manager 世界上最伟大俱乐部（必须的） of the biggest club in the world?
我觉得你还没决出来，是不是？

多谢卡兄。

感觉很淡定。

我可不想接受这些无形的压力，再不要给我说了 "L don't need this pressure, Cameron, please, do not say that again."
可是，第二天，他又给我说了一样一样的话 The next day, he says exactly the same thing.
刚刚回顾了一下关于桑德兰的报告 Just reviewed the scouting report of Sunderland.
刚刚做完了收尾工作 Just finishing touches, really.
对于比赛，对于球员们，我已经成竹在胸了 I've got the team, I know the subs,
我很清楚自己在干什么 so, yeah, my mind's clear.
我的目标就是赢球 Main focus is winning the game.
当我接手球队的时候我要给我的球员们 When I took over it was give the group...
一个机会，这是我需要做的 ...every player in the group a chance, so that's what I'm doing.
就像球员时代的我一样，精益求精 Just as a player I'll do my best
努力做到最好，去赢得比赛 to try and influence winning the game
信任我的队员们 and, yeah, trust the players.
过去的一周我已经做了十分充分的准备， I've done all the preparation during 已经准备好比赛了 the week and ready to go now,
快点开球吧 can't wait for 3:

(人群欢呼)
瑞恩：

他们势头正劲，而且他们同样也要为保级而战 They've got the momentum and they're fighting for their lives as well,
所以，他们配得上这场比赛的胜利 so, in the end, they deserve the victory, 或者说今天他们是表现更好的那一支球队 even though we were the better team,
他们创造出了更多的得分机会 they probably created the better chances.
第二场比赛的结果一下子把他拉回现实 The second game brought him back down to earth with a bump,
然后我想他会弄明白那场球 and I think he'll have thought out of that game.
我想通过这场比赛，他会学到更多。

关于失败，我还没和他谈过 The defeat, I've not spoken to him about it, 他也许从失败中学到的要比从 but he probably learnt
胜利中学到的要多很多 more from the defeat than he has done maybe from the victories.
瑞恩：

感觉有些球员让我失望了 and felt a little bit let down by some of the players
然后不断的提醒自己 and just thought to myself,
再不能这样了 "That won't happen again."
上周比赛过后确实很失望 Just disappointed after the performance last week.
感觉有点泄气，赛季快结束了，无欲无求的 It was a little bit flat, had the end

的比赛，我讨厌这样 nothing

也许他们缺乏紧张感吧 Maybe they just lost that little bit of intensity,
他们也许想我也就是个救火教练 and they do maybe see me as just for four games.
我做出了不训练的的决定， I made the decision not to train,
也许那是我犯的另一个错误吧 maybe that's another decision that I got wrong as well.
作为教练，失败的感觉糟透了 As a manager the feeling of defeat is a lot worse.
灰常不爽 A lot worse.
斯泰西：

我认为，他心情很差 I just thought, you know, he was so down.
所以我说：

你不能给你自己施加太大的压力 "you can't put too much pressure on yourself,"
但是他显得非常疲惫和异常的安静， but he was gutted and really quiet, 这有些诡异啊，他平常不是这样的 which isn't like him
因为你知道吧，平时当他踢球的时候 because normally, you know, 如果某场比赛踢不好 if he has a bad game
只要他一回家，和孩子们一起玩耍 as soon as he walks through the door, we've got the kids
他就会放松下拉 and we do stuff and it's left there,
然而这回能感觉出来他依然承受了很大的压力 whereas this was kind of really still there.
林恩·约翰逊（吉格斯母亲）昨天有人问我 LYNNE JOHNSON:

看你儿子踢球或者当曼联教练，哪个更糟？

我觉得他当教练会更糟一些 And watching him as a manager is worse
我认为一个球员在场上可以得到你队友的帮助 because I think as a player you've got ten other people that could help,
然后做为一个主教练什么事情都得自己扛着 whereas it's all on his head.
(不错吧)
我们准备没有问题， We prepared right, we knew that Sunderland 我知道桑德兰不是一块难啃的骨头 were gonna be a tough team
因为他们状态正佳 because they were on a good run,
而我选择了一些球员 and you just pick a team.

我觉得这些队员是可以赢得比赛胜利的 I thought could win the game, 而且我我相信他们 and I trusted the players,
但是其中的一些球员 and some of the players
辜负了我也辜负了他们自己 let me down and let themselves down.
也许是我不太严厉吧 Maybe I was a little bit too soft.
我不管你来头多猛，我也不管 I don't care where you are in the league and I don't care
比赛的进程如何 if the results have been going badly,
只要你穿上这红色的战袍 if you step onto that pitch as a United player,
你就必须全力以赴的去战斗，如果你做不动这一点 you give it your all, and if you don't, 那么下一场比赛你就再不用出场了 then you deserve not to play the next game.
瑞恩：

早些年间，我习惯于胜利讨厌失败 From an early age, I was used to winning,
甚至害怕失败，因为你知道失败的感觉 and it's that fear of losing 要比胜利带给你的影响大的多 because you know losing is a much bigger
的多 emotion than winning.
当球队胜利的时候，是很棒的。

当球队失败了，感觉很糟糕 When you lose, it's not great, 但是这种感觉不会很快减轻，会持续很久很久 but it doesn't go away for a long, long time.
我已经和他谈了 I've spoken to him.

他现在思考着该如何应对 so he's in the real world 主教练们都会遇到 with the other coaches
的各种各样的问题，这些会伴着他入眠的 and managers taking every sort of little problem to bed with him,
绞尽脑子的去先考虑该如何调配阵容 thinking about how he's gonna leave players out.
但是吉格斯了不起的就是他可以冷静下来 But he's got the clinical side 去思考自己该怎么做 to be able to do that,
他有着沉着冷静的性格去处理问题 he's got the temperament to be able deal with that.
作为一个主教练你得去做一些主要的决定 As a manager you have to make big decisions,
当然有些事情所有教练们都告诉过你 and obviously that's something that all managers will tell you,
他绝对是那种可以做决定的人物 and he is absolutely capable of making big decisions.
比赛完了之后我很低落 I was upset after the game, 一直到我 but the longer it's gone on
自己变得越来越焦躁，缺乏睡眠 since I've just got angrier and angrier.
的时候，我才意识到，我不能再这样了 I've slept less and less, and just can't have it.

如果队员们有人来问我他们为什么不能出场时 If any of them want to come and see me and ask me why they're not playing,
我都不想去和他们争辩什么 then I'll tell them, and I don't think they'll have a leg to stand on.
因为曼联和桑德兰比赛时， I mean, I was stood on the side against Sunderland, just wishing
我也希望我可以自己替补上场 I'd made myself sub, 去改变战局 so I could do something about it.
我打赌无论谁当主教练都会这么想 I bet every manager thinks like that, 但是我现在出在一个特殊的位置 but I'm in a position
我还是可以继续踢球，继续改变比赛的 where I'm still playing and can still affect the game.
我知道他觉得调整整容对他来讲是最难的 I know he has said the difficult part has been leaving players out,
他是我觉得他足矣胜任了。

给球员们解释为什么不让球员出场的原因 why he's left them out, 他不仅仅是宣布大名单 he won't just name a team
而且还告诉落选的球员们， and not tell players 他们为什么落选 why he's leaving them out.
他会这么做的，我认为这十分重要 He'll do that, which I think is important.
他发过几次脾气 He's got a bit of a snap in him, 我不能给你说 I can tell you that.
但是我见过几次 I've seen that a few times.
但是我认为这是一种精神力量。

永不言弃 that desire to win.
瑞恩：

咱们就事论事有话直说 "and be really straightforward."
这也是为什么我经常从我信任的那些朋友 That's why I've got people who I know 中得到最中肯的意见 and trust to give me honest opinions.
我认为曼联的传统就是重视青训球员 I think the club's always been based around 提携他们 bringing young players through
给他们出场的机会 and giving them a chance.

都求战欲望强烈 they have no fear 他们踢球就像 and they just go out and play
在街头踢球那般 like they're in the park, 给球队注入了新的活力 and it injects enthusiasm,
速度，和一些有乐趣的正能量 speed, you know, just a bit of happy energy
这对我们延续这种传统来说，是非常重要的 around the place, really, and it's important
你想想如果当年 that we continue that trend, and if it weren't
老爷子不给我们机会 for Sir Alex giving us our chance, 我们也许不会有今天 we probably wouldn't be here now.
瑞恩：

和我们一起练练。

我知道周二接到通知前都没有接到通知 I hadn't trained since that Tuesday 这做起来有些困难 when I got told, and it's hard to.
因为要从7点半开始，不停的训练， It's hard to train from getting in from at 7:

然后再热身准备好10点半的训练的课程 and then try and prepare yourself for a training session at 10:

这是很困难的，但是你知道吧， It's hard, but, yeah, 我那时已经决定确保自己 I was determined to make sure that
在下场比赛中可以出场 I was involved in the next game.
我周一加练，是不是？

对，太爽了，太爽了 Yeah, loved it, loved it.
当然同样也有很好的指挥训练，指导球员 And bossed it as well, 所以那感觉棒极了 boss trainer, so that was even better.
瑞恩：

因为那就像你锻炼之后 because you know what it's like after you've exercised,
会感觉良好 you just feel great.
有的时候，我问那些退役球员 You know, you speak to ex

你们还喜欢训练么 and, "Do you still enjoy training?"
哈哈，当然 Well, yeah, of course I do.
他们有些人也许到职业生涯后期就不再训练了 And some of them maybe at the end didn't.
我从来没有过 I never, ever got to that point where I don't wanna go out there.
能够在顶级联赛纵横25年 To be able to go for 25 years at the highest level
取得惹人注目的巨大成功，这其中必然有 and be pretty successful at that 些事情 takes something special.
是很少有人做到过的 It takes something that not a lot of people have,
必然有一些值得人深入挖掘思考的 and it takes something that you have to dig down
甚至在职业生涯进入尾期的时候 even more so towards the latter part of your career
会比刚出道的时候做到还要好 than what you did in the beginning.
当过去我让他们跑圈的时候 When we'd send them off on a run, there was Ryan
吉格斯总是冲在最前面，秒杀队友 away at the front, killing everyone.
罗布森是很好的运动员，很棒的助理教练 Robson was a great athlete, a great trainer.
他经常警告吉格斯,哥，悠着点， He used to warn him, "For Christ's sake, 我们都知道你牛逼 you're showing us up."
我的成功呢离不开我自己私人 I've had my own little team 团队 that's kept me going to 40.
萨拉是瑜伽老师，菲利普尼尔（私人理疗师） Sarah, yoga teacher.

感觉好点吗

(毫无疑问的是，你要在顶级联赛中具有竞争力， 夺取胜利你得有着坚定的信念。

(国王：

(之前谁说我呢？

不是吧

你这是要我的命啊你 You're killing me here.
咱们先打完周六的比赛再说吧 Yeah, I'll get through Saturday first, and then think about that.
你说的对。

谢谢 Thanks, mate.
谢啦 Thanks.
老爷子：

这么多年让自己身体保持在一个 that it's these great attributes of balance
很高的竞技状态 and weight and stamina,
这也是为什么他可以在40岁的年 and that has allowed him to stay in the game 龄依然在顶级联赛中征战的原因 stay in the gameand play at 40 years of age.
他真心太牛了！

瑞恩：

球迷们震天的呼喊会让你变得更强，变得无所畏惧 The roar of the crowd just makes you bigger, makes you stronger
尤其是他们高呼你名字的时候 when they're cheering your name.
你会为球迷而战，毫无保留，乐在其中 You want to do well for the fans and you love it,
你会留恋这种感觉， you embrace it, you just 想让这个时刻可以永远 want them feelings to last forever.
(他过去在弗格森麾下，为那支习惯于胜利， 习惯于冠军的曼联队效力。

瑞恩：

那是一场毫无激情的比赛 and pretty lacklustre performance,
所以呢，我想给球队注入一些新的东西 so I wanted to bring some energy, I wanted to bring some freshness
打算让一些新人出场。

汤姆·劳伦斯（威尔士)和詹姆斯威尔逊 Tom Lawrence and James Wilson.
年轻队员会尝试一些新的东西， What young players will do, they'll try things, 会做一些老球员不会 they'll do things that maybe players
去尝试的动作。

他们带到队里，而且他们没让我失望 in throwing them in and they didn't disappoint me.
(人群欢呼)
正如你所见到的，这孩子进第一个球的时候 You seen it, I celebrated 我在庆祝 when Willo scored the first goal.
每个人都是这样从首秀一步一步过来的 We've all been there, we've all been there as young players making the debut.
这是一个美妙的时刻 It was a great moment.
从2：

无论你打过多少场比赛， No matter how many games you play, 只要你对你的球迷心存感激 if you get a great response off the fans,
那么他们的便会 then it has an effect on you 在某个时刻给你额外的动力 and gives you that extra spring in your step.
对，我之前想过这一场就是我的最后一场了，终于 Yeah, there was a little bit in my head 该吹终场哨了 that this could be the last time.
感觉还可以吧 But, no, I just felt good.
我就是想着怎么打好比赛 I just went on and
和我之前参加的962场比赛没有什么区别 did what I do, really, and no different than any other game that I'd approached.
(人群欢呼)
（这个球真心遗憾，否则就是完美谢幕了）
不，如果要我说的话，我宁愿这个 No, I would have liked 赛季进球 to have scored this season,
但是很遗憾我没进 but it wasn't to be.
我对这个已经很淡定了。

我想我会喜欢的 I would have loved to, yeah, 我在想什么？

我真的真的想在这个赛季进个球 I would have really, really loved to, but
可是没有如愿 didn't happen.
(欢呼)
利伯蒂：

瑞恩：

瑞恩：

瑞恩：

利伯蒂：

利伯蒂：

斯泰西：

这个哥哥踢得很好对吧

斯泰西：

利伯蒂：

因为你放了两个年轻队员在前面

是的

你知道吧，老爸10年轻也和她们一样 Well, Daddy was a young player once upon a time,
岁月是把杀猪刀啊 about ten years ago.
利伯蒂：

瑞恩：

你已经踢球踢了四分之一个世纪了 because you've been playing for 25 years.
瑞恩：

老爷子：

教练或者其他什么你在退役之后选的职业 Coaching, whatever you ever do 是没法和踢足球相提并论的 after football does not compare
这是大实话 to playing a game of football.
这些在杯赛，在莫斯科的雨夜罚进的最后一个点球 Those cup final goals, the last goal, the penalty kick in Moscow,
还有在足总杯对阵阿森纳的千里走单骑 the great goal against Arsenal 一旦有一天你离开这个舞台，这些成就便再也无法复制了 can never be achieved again once you stop.
对于世界上最大最好的俱乐部 The biggest club of the world.

记者：

这个问题你得去问俱乐部，而不是我 It's not...

我的工作的方向一直没有改变 My stance isn't any different from it was last week.
当然，这其中也传出了转会传闻 Obviously, there's huge speculation, 最后并没有什么事情发生 but nothing's been announced yet,
我现在的工作就是准备下一周和南安普顿的比赛 and my job is to prepare the team for Southampton, so that's what I'll do.
我认为通知马上就出来了， I'm sure there'll be an announcement soon, 也许我还可以抽时间说几句 and then maybe I can comment on it then,
但是现在只是推测，我也没啥好说的 but at the moment it's just speculation, so there's not a lot I can say.
球队今天必须要努力加油， Team today gonna have to work hard 因为今天也是一场硬仗 because these work their bollocks off
他们主场实力很强，但是与他们相比 and they're good at home, 我们整体比他们强 but the team that we've got,
我们更加有经验，速度更快，技术更好 we've got experience, we've got pace, we've got players who can...
有着可以一己之力改变战局的球员 Who are comfortable on the ball.
他们最终还是会输的，还有，替补队员们 They do die at the end, so, subs,
你们可能会随时上场，并帮助球队获得胜利 you might come on and win the game, 所以请你们专心的好好看节目 so concentrate, watch the game.
但是这是最后一个赛季， But it's last game this season, 我们想要给球迷留一个好的印象 we want to end on a high.
我们想让曼联的支持者有可谈论比赛的东西 We want to give our fans something to shout about,
曼城和利物浦要争冠了 and City or Liverpool are gonna win the league.
我们的支持一个交代 Give our fans something to shout about.
毕竟这是一个令人失望的赛季 It's been a frustrating season, 但是可以打出一场好的比赛。

打出那种我期望以久的感觉。

我们的球员已经准备好了 that we've got on the pitch.

我还记得在曼彻斯特机场下飞机的时候 Yeah, we got off the plane at Manchester 我和她们一一告别， airport and I was saying goodbye
感谢了他们的辛苦付出 to the players, thanking them.
我想说，这可能是最后一次 Like I say, potentially saying goodbye
向这么多球员告别了，还向一些工作人员 to a lot of players for the last time, 表示感谢 a bit of staff.
（缓口气)
我不是认为自己是情绪化的那种人 I'm not an emotional...

我真的不是情绪化的那种人 I'm not a really emotional person,
但是从机场出来我就想赶紧找到我的车 but my car was parked right outside and I thought, "I need to get in my car here."
我在控制自己的情绪 I could feel myself getting emotional.
我进了车 So I get in my car,
就开始哭了，哭的很难受。

很难受 getting really emotional.
我觉得这个就是 I think it was just
自己憋在心里的各种情绪的 a mixture of what I've just said, saying goodbye to people
的一种爆发，不管是和自己有关的，还是和别人相关的 for maybe the last time and the pressure that I'd put myself under.
这听起来难以理解啊 Sounds stupid now.
一点也不争睹你 But it's just not me, just not me at all.
我从机场出来 I come out of the airport
在夜色中 and I come at the light,
尼克巴特就挨着就坐下了 Nicky Butt's just pulled up next to me and I'm thinking...
你妹啊。

所以我就招了一下手，走其他的路 so l just give him a little wave and just look the other way,
等到灯变绿 waiting for the lights to go green.
大家意料之中的曼联新主帅已经出来了 The new, but expected management line

范加尔 at Manchester United.
现荷兰国家队主教练 Louis van Gaal, currently the coach of the Dutch National Team,
会接替莫耶斯 will replace David Moyes.
吉格斯将会出任助理教练 His assistant will be Ryan Giggs, and with that appointment
顶级联赛活化石吉格斯 the Premier League's most decorated player announced
在24个赛季之后，终于决定挂靴 he is hanging up his boots after 24 seasons with the club.
我和范加尔谈的很投机 The meeting went really well.

我希望和他一起工作， and I'm looking forward to working 并且从他身上学到一些东西 with him and learning from him.
范加尔做了一个正确的决定 He's made a big decision, 我认为作为范加尔的助手去 I think it's a good one,
继续工作是非常不错的选择 to continue as an assistant to Louis van Gaal.
它可以学到很多东西 He'll learn so much,
但是吉格斯，在这四场临时执教的比赛中 but Ryan Giggs has got a lot of good ideas himself, as we saw
已经学到了很多新的东西 during those four games as caretaker.
瑞恩：

这就是一个奇妙的体育，享受整个过程 it was just a brilliant experience and one that I thoroughly enjoyed
这些都会为你下次的成功 and will be all the better for
打下坚实的基础 the next time it happens.
我当然也有过不开心的时候 I had sad moments in there, 当然更多的时候，是非常愉快的时光 but, more often than not, happy moments.
大部分时候都是 Most of them happy, yeah.
大部分赛季都是结束之后都会庆祝 Most of them celebrating the end of a season.
进到更衣室 You come in,
拿上你的浴巾 get your towel,
用浴巾盖住衣服 cover your clothes in a towel 因为你知道的 because you know that
香槟开始乱喷啦 the champagne's gonna be sprayed, so...
有过这种经历的球员们 The experienced players, 他们一从赛场回来 as soon as they'd come in from the pitch,
他们就会这么做 they'd do that straight away.

他们这是在干嘛 who hadn't experienced it, "What are they doing?"
马上你就会感到 And soon find out.
我不用明天再来更衣室了 A strange feeling knowing that
这是一种有些奇怪的感觉 I don't have to come in tomorrow and
对于我老说这是一段新的刺激人生的开始 that it's a new beginning and it's exciting.

会感觉到 it's going into
下个赛季会变得不同 what is gonna be a different season, 自己会过一个不同的夏天 a different summer.
(足球会永远陪伴着你，无论是否远离球场)
对于任何一个球员来说 The defining moment as a player, 在足总杯对阿森纳的进球 there's only one,
绝对是一生一次的高光时刻。

这个是实话，因为人们一直在谈论这个进球 because that's all people talk about.
当然他要从截断维埃拉的传球开始 Of course, he starts on this foray of running the defenders by Vieira,
过了迪克森，过了基翁，又过了迪克森 by Dixon, by Keown, by Dixon,
把球射进。

他用来超乎超人的技术和控球 That extraordinary balance and technique 勇往直前，单骑闯关 and touch and fearlessness
摧毁了那条英超可能是有史以来 to destroy what was probably the greatest defence
最佳的后防线 that the Premier League has ever seen.
然后洞穿了当时英国的最佳门将 And then had to beat the best keeper in England
大卫希曼的城门 at the time, David Seaman, 彻底击垮了他 and he smashed it above him.
当然最精彩的部分，莫过于之后的庆祝 The best thing, obviously, about that was the celebration afterwards.
他脱掉球衣，举过头顶不断绕圈 And he had his top and giving that one around his head.
哈哈，不幸的是 Yeah, unfortunately, 别人一直会以为我有 I will never, ever live down...
那些性感的胸毛了：

这毕竟是足总杯143年历史上最佳进球啊 that Arsenal goal just gets shown so many times.
哥现在想如果那时候胸毛没那么多 I wish they would just cut it 该多好：

所以，我余下的职业生涯 So the rest of my career 需要做的就是忘掉这些 is just forgotten about,
当然哥比较低调啦。

如果你要问我在曼联历史上有些球员是最棒的 If you asked me the three or four best players in United's history,
毫无疑问，吉格斯位列其中 Giggs is definitely one of them, absolutely no doubt.
也许其他人你不同意，但是他毫无争议！

瑞恩：

这是上天给我的恩赐，每一天，我都心存感激 since I left school to now, 40,
一直为自己从小就喜欢的球队效力 and play for a team that I supported as a kid.
这么多年，总是为冠军而战，在 I've also been fortunate to win things,
世界上最佳的主教练带领下比赛， and to play under the greatest manager ever
能够和一些顶尖球员在一起战斗，对我来说，足够了 and to play with some of the greatest players to ever grace a football pitch.
我是那种永远向前看的人 I'm always the kind of person who tries to look forward,
不会沉沦于过去的阴霾 doesn't dwell on things,
因为如果我做了不好的事 because if I did, (喘口气)
那肯定会影响到我 I'd probably get upset
让我变得不开心，但是这无所谓啊。

因为我这一世作为球员，已经无憾了！

963场之后，吉格斯终于告别球员生涯。

他们肩并肩走出球场的那一幕， 画面太美，不敢直视
谁的思绪倒退三十年，那些夕阳下的伙伴， 那些旧日的足迹
那些无与伦比的成长的日子， 那些年在一起踢球，又放学回家的少年。
当你们随着老特拉福德的阶梯步步而上的时候， 真正红魔，是你们称谓，一起进，一起退。

当你们年轻时，可惜，你我已不再年轻。

光荣属于曼联！
