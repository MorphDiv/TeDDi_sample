该死 Damn it.
又来 Again?
医疗中心
我问你 理查德 Let me ask you something, Richard.
你确定这不是尿 You sure it's not urine
你确定你不是尿床了 and you're not just wetting the bed?
我确定 不是尿 Yeah, I'm sure.

只是汗 It's just sweat.
那么你这种情况的医学术语 Well, then the medical term for what you have
是"盗汗" is "Night sweats."
好吧 Okay.
但盗汗可能演变成尿床 But night sweats can be a precursor to bed

那就很严重了 and that is very serious.
有多严重 How serious?
-是说可能是癌症吗

是太丢人了 It's embarrassing.
你都是成年人了 理查德 拜托 I mean, you're a grown man, Richard.

小孩子才会尿床 That's what children do.
但我又没有尿床 But I'm not wetting the bed.
还没有 你的压力水平如何 Yet!

比以前更糟 It's gotten worse.
我的平台需要在一月前 I have to get a working beta of my platform
发布公测版 ready in time for January.
一个噩梦般的家伙刚投资了我 I just took money from a guy who is a nightmare.
我雇了六位新人 I hired six new people.
我们还要花一大笔钱租新办公室 We're going to spend a ton of money on new offices.
就像是每分每秒 It's like every second,
都有新的问题亟待解决 there is a new issue that I have to solve.
我快被压力逼疯了 I am stressed as hell.
理查德 你现在的压力等级在这里 Richard, currently, your stress level is here.
是盗汗的级别 And that's night

但如果你不加注意的话 它就会升高 But now if you're not careful and you let it go up,
变成尿床的级别 bed

我爱死这些墙了 I love these walls.
你知道这是什么吗 这叫暴露砖墙 You know what it is?

为什么会有人想把砖藏起来 Why would anyone ever hide brick?
你看到那个会议角了吗 Did you see the conference nook?
想想在这个角落里开会有多么美妙吧 Just think of the conferences we could have in this nook.
没错 但这里真的很贵 Oh, yeah.

医生怎么说 So, um, what did the doctor say?
没什么 只是压力导致的盗汗 It's nothing.

-我会没事的

-感觉松了口气吗

直到那白痴开始提什么 if that idiot hadn't have mentioned something about
这会演变成尿床 how it can lead to, uh, bed

我只想尽量不去想这件事 I'm just trying not to think about it.
没错 别想了 Good, don't.

因为光是想想就有可能 Because just thinking about it would probably
-增加你的压力导致尿床

你能不能别说"压力"这个词了 Would you

我刚说过我在努力不去想它 I just said that I was trying not to think about it.
理查德 个人管理 Well, Richard, personal management
是首席执行官职责里很重要的部分 is a big part of being a CEO.
你觉得在这儿工作会有帮助吗 You think working here might help?
事实上 会吧 我觉得会 Actually, uh, yeah.

但我们租得起吗 But can we afford it?
这是对你心理健康的投资 Well, this is an investment in your mental health.
理查德 我是说 Richard, I mean,
你能花钱买到不尿床吗 can you put a dollar value on not wetting your bed?
别再说了 Ahh, don't.
如果你想要 理查德 If you want this, Richard,
尽管我们在周边和广告牌上浪费了些钱 even with the money we wasted on swag and billboards,
我觉得我能想办法搞定的 I think I can make the numbers work.
取决于你了 It's your call.
伙计们 这位是叶莲娜 Hey, guys?

她电梯下错楼层了 She got off the elevator at the wrong floor
她的模特经纪公司在楼上 because her modeling agency is upstairs.
理查德 Richard?
拜托 Please?
考虑到其他一些重要原因 Primarily for other reasons,
但 没错 我们就租这里 but, uh, yes!

-我们要了 这办公室我们要了

我得拥抱你一下 I'm gonna hug you.
别 No.
好了 这一箱可以搬到卡车上了 All right, this one's ready to go out to the truck.
很好 搬出去吧 Great.

跟你说 我提议雇几个苦力来 Okay, you know what?

这不是我该干的活 I don't do this kind of stuff.
我是脑力劳动者 不是体力劳动者 I work with my mind, not with my hands.
在巴基斯坦 我们都是雇仆人来做这个 In Pakistan, we had servants who did this.
稀松平常的事 It wasn't a big deal.
我们付的钱很少 但他们都很满足 We didn't pay them very much and they were very happy.
我还是帮你把你的卫生巾搬出去吧 I'll take out your box of tampons.
净化下我的心灵 It's good for the soul.
有趣的展示 Interesting pitch.
我得承认我从没听说过 I will admit, I have never heard
有人想做面向基督徒的狗狗分享应用 a Christian

不过基督教在北加州可以说是非法的 But Christianity is borderline illegal in northern California.
另外你们打算怎么扩展业务呢 Also, how would you scale?
我们可以从分享狗狗 Well, we could expand
扩展到其他类型的宠物上 from sharing dogs to other types of pets

-大肚猪 雪貂

你们知道在加州 You do know that ferrets are illegal
养雪貂是非法的吧 in the state of California?
看来不知道 No.
那我看你也不知道 Well, then I suppose you also don't know
养大肚猪早在2005年 that pot

就已经土得不可理喻了 wildly unfashionable since 2005.
这年头养大肚猪 Owning a pot

就跟信基督教一样没法上街见人 frowned upon almost as much as being a Christian.
谢谢 先生们 日安 Thank you, gentlemen.

严格来讲我并没有拒绝分享狗狗的点子 And technically, I'm not passing on dog dammit.
我只是没同意 I'm just not saying yes.
谁知道呢 天道难测 But who knows?

不用我说你们也知道吧 I don't have to tell you that.
理查德 你有时间吗 Richard, do you have a moment?
我要给你看样东西 I'd like to present you something.
好吧 是什么 Okay, what's up?
-你干什么呢

日本人的商业文化 The Japanese have the most advanced
是世界上最先进的 business culture in the world.
我遵循他们的礼节来表达对你的尊重 I am showing you respect by using their traditions.
而且根据传统 And traditionally,
你需要送出一份礼物来庆祝重大时刻 you give a gift on important occasions,
比如你被孵人生涯正式结束 such as the graduating of an incubee.
被孵人 有这个词吗 "Incubee"?

当然有 就是被孵化的人 Of course it is.

在孵化器里呆过的那种 The inhabitant of an incubator.
好吧 Okay.

-该你鞠躬了

理查德 我需要你鞠躬 Richard, I need you to bow.
-90度

好了 Okay.
现在我把这个赠与你 Now I hand this to you,
根据传统你要礼貌地回绝我 and it is customary for you to politely refuse
并暗示你配不上这份礼物 and weakly say that you are not worthy.
埃利希 我没时间陪你玩了 Erlich, I really don't have time for this.
做得好 给你 That's perfect.

好吧 Good.
日元硬币 最小面值 Japanese coin.

这是和服吗 Is this a kimono?
-试试看

それは名誉でした Sore wa meiyodeshita.
根据谷歌翻译 According to google translate,
这句话的意思是 "我很荣幸" that means, "It has been an honor."
荣幸 荣幸 Yeah, all right.
多谢 多谢 Thank you.

我还得打包东西 可不能把衣服刮坏了 I'm still packing up, so I don't want to damage it.
慢着 传统上和服要卷好 Eh, eh, traditionally it's rolled.
好吧 Okay.
维基上说的 Wikipedia.
谢谢 埃利希 Thanks, Erlich.
我以后再送你点东西 I'll get you something later.
少年 你已经给了我一个礼物 Little Kohai, you've already given me a gift.
我叫诺亚 住隔壁 Noah from next door.
我叫理查德 Richard.
要搬走吗 Moving out?
是的 其中几个人要搬走 Uh, yeah, some of us are, sort of.
我也不想骗你说看到你搬走我很难受 Well, I'd be lying to say I was sad to see you go.
-好吧

你看起来是个好人 You seem like nice guys,
只是出租房太多会影响社区形象 just houses full of renters aren't great for property values.
是啊 你说的有道理 Yeah, that makes sense.
这片大多是住家 This neighborhood is mostly families.
好吧 我们正要搬走 Okay.

养宠物的人 你懂吗 People with pets, you know?
-祝你好运

-什么

-理查德

理查德 那家准备租给我们 Richard, the hosting company
服务器的公司 that was going to be renting us
刚刚撤销了他们的报价 server space just dropped their bid.
好吧 Okay, well,
那就从别家租吧 let's just get servers from some other provider.
我刚联系了五家网络服务公司 Well, I just contacted five other web services companies,
他们都拒绝了 and they're all denying us.
我觉得我知道是怎么回事 I think I know what might be happening here.
所有公司 All of them

'货架空间' '软层' '亚马逊' Rackspace, Softlayer, Amazon.
他们不想失去'互利'这个客户 I mean, they can't afford to lose Hooli's business.
所以盖文·贝尔森只要 So Gavin Belson can just
打个电话 我们就变成 pick up the phone and make us radioactive
所有网络服务商的噩梦吗 to every single web

这些人就是这样做生意的 It's how these guys operate.
当比尔·盖茨在拉奈岛[夏威夷]结婚时 I mean, when Bill Gates got married on Lanai,
他租下了夏威夷群岛的所有直升机 he rented every helicopter on the Hawaiian islands
就为了让狗仔队无法拍到照片 so that paparazzi couldn't use them to fly over.
对那件事而言是有益的 Although in that case, it was a positive,
因为你现在就能任意想象那场婚礼了 because now you can imagine that wedding however you want.
-什么

我们整个平台都是基于网络搭建的 Our entire platform is web

我们需要服务器 We need servers for that.
现在我们该他妈怎么办 What the fuck are we going to do?
我知道我们该他妈怎么办了 I know what the fuck we're going to do.
但你们肯定不喜欢我的方法 But you're not going to like it.
我们自己搭建服务器 We build our own servers.
吉尔弗约尔 服务器基本等同于基础设施 Gilfoyle, servers are essentially a utility.
我是说 你不会为了喝水就去挖井 I mean, you wouldn't dig a well for water
或者为了电造一个发电机 or build a generator for power.
我认为我们应该挖个属于自己的井 I think we should dig our own well
也应该造自己的发电机 and build our own generator.
我还认为我们应该在一个防爆破地窖中 I also think we should store a year's worth of food
储存一年量的食物和枪支弹药 and ammunition in a blast cellar.
但我们没有 But we don't.
所以祝你们遇到大灾变的时候有个好运气 So good luck when the shit hits the fan.
听着 理查德 我们的工作在于准确度 Look, Richard, we're about precision,
在于在堆栈空间中节省 about shaving yocto seconds off latency
10的24次方分之一秒的速度 at every layer in the stack.
如果我们租用公共云服务器 If we rent from a public cloud,
我们就是在使用一些骨子里就很普通 we're using servers that are by definition
以及不稳定的服务器 generic and unpredictable.
是的 但是我们的时间已经很紧了 Yeah, but we're already up against a serious deadline.
我是说 搭建自己的服务器 I mean, how long is building our own servers
又要拖延我们多久 going to set us back?
如果我拼了老命的话 If I busted my ass?
我可以在一周之内完成 I could stand them up inside a week
就在这栋房子里 right here in the house.
听着 理查德 事实上 Look, richard, truth is,
这是一件很好的事 this is a huge positive.
我曾在我的旧比特币矿机上运行我们的平台 I tried running the platform on my old bitcoin rig
每秒浮点运算次数是五千二百兆 at 5200 GFLOPS,
如果在GPU而不是CPU上运行你的程序 your algorithm flies 800 times faster
速度还能再提八百倍 on GPUs compared to normal CPUs.
没有任何运营商能提供 No host could match the config
我在这屋里架设的配置 that I built here in the house.
而且我们好像也别无选择 Oh, and also, we don't seem to have a choice.
可那要花很多钱 But that would cost a ton.
我们没有那么多闲钱 And we don't have that kind of money just lying around.
看来我们确实有 It seems as though we do
这么多的闲钱 have that kind of money just lying around.
可那是用来租办公室的 But that's for the office space.
-是吗

贾里德 我们已经签了合同 Jared, we already signed the lease.
已经太晚了对吧 我们不能毁约 It's too late, right?

我们还没给他们寄支票 I mean, we haven't given them the check yet.
-那就这么定了

以现在的市场需求 他们可能 In this market, they could probably
一天之内就能找到别的租客 find another tenant in a day.
我觉得应该没问题 I doubt there would be an issue.
操 理查德 求你了 Fuck!

服务器或办公室 理查德 It's servers or offices, Richard.
我们只能选一 We can't afford both.
该死 我不知道该怎么办 Damn it, I don't know what to do.
那真是算你们走运 Well, then it's a good thing

算你们走运我在这里 对吧 It's a good thing that I'm here, isn't it?
我虽然很不想附和吉尔弗约尔 As much as I hate to agree with Gilfoyle,
但他说的没错 你们别无选择 he's right

留下来 自己架设服务器 Stay here and build the servers.
你确定吗 Are you sure?
因为我已经雇了卡尔拉 还有另五个程序员 Because I've got Carla and five other coders
过几周就要来上班 starting over the next few weeks.
到时候这里会有点人满为患 Well, it's going to get a little cozy in here,
不过为了你我会尽量容忍的 but I'll endure for your sake.
那你其他的被孵人该怎么办 What about all your other "Incubees"?
我上周听了不少有意思的点子 I've heard quite a few exciting pitches over the last week,
但是为了你们这个平庸的项目 but I'll be forced to forgo those opportunities
我不得不放弃了这些机会 because of your mediocrity.
理查德 我邀请你住进我的孵化器 You see, Richard, when I invited you into my incubator,
我承诺帮你们成长到足以应对外面的世界 I promised to get you ready for the outside world.
但我没做到 我不想把你们扔出去 But I failed to do that.

在这个现实的世界里遭受伤害 in the real world as far as I could throw you.
坦白讲 我其实能把你们 And to be honest, I could probably throw you
扔出我的前院 all the way across the front yard.
好吧 可我不想待在这里 Okay, but I don't want to stay here.
我也不想你留下 理查德 I don't want you to either, Richard.
所以我们达成一致了 So it's agreed.
欢迎回家 伙计们 Welcome home, fellas.
我们要抽点大麻庆祝一下吗 Should we smoke some pot to celebrate?
盖文 多谢你能来 Gavin, thank you for coming.
我确信只要你看到 I am certain that once you
达头蒂先生目前的项目 witness firsthand what Mr.

你会发现他在这里毫无价值 you will see that he is worthless around here.
价值是一个相对的概念 Worth is a relative thing.
对 但毫无价值不是 这是绝对的 Yes, but worthlessness is not.

人们通过很多不同的方式为公司增加价值 People add value to this company in many different ways.
当然 可你看看这个 Of course, but look at this.
达头蒂让他的团队浪费着宝贵的资源 Bighetti has his team wasting valuable resources
-研究土豆加农炮

二 一 Two, one.
开火 Fire.
该死 Shit.
你看到你最优秀的人才都浪费在什么事上了吗 You see what your brightest minds are being wasted on?
发射土豆 Launching potatoes.
-搞毛啊

也许他们想研制一种 Perhaps they're developing it as a
非致命驱散人群的方法 non

我觉得这其实很有杀伤力 I actually think that it could kill somebody.
就算如此 跟我的团队 But even so, compared to what my team
在这几天取得的成果相比 我...

过来 我想让你见见这个 Come here, I want you to meet somebody.
好吧 下一炮一定会打准 All right, I've got a good feeling about this one.
再来一次 所有人准备 开火 One more time.

该死 你没事吧 抱歉 该死 Oh, shit!

这是奇科 This is Kiko.
奇科获救前在尼加拉瓜 Kiko was rescued after a Nicaraguan land

被地雷炸断了双臂 severed both his arms.
我的团队利用在萨莫维尔开发出的科技 My team, using technology developed at Somerville,
构建了一系列传感器 was able to devise an array of sensors
不用植入它身体 即可感知 that can non

大脑运动皮层神经传来的信号 from the neurones in the motor cortex in the brain.
这样不用手术就可给予奇科 So without surgery, we have given Kiko the gift
可用的附加假肢 of a usable prosthetic appendage.
他在干什么 What's he doing?
奇科选择怎样利用科技 What Kiko chooses to do with the technology
并不重要 is not important.
重要的是 What's important here is that,
不管表象如何 in spite of what it may seem like on the surface,
研发出如此功能的设备 building a device that is capable of this
是重大的科研成果 is a remarkable scientific achievement.
您眼前所见无疑证明了我团队的能力 And what you're looking at is really a testament
和我的领导能力 to my team and to my leadership,
我就是觉得 And I just

如果要我留任 I'm going to have to insist
我强烈要求您调走达头蒂 that Bighetti be removed if I continue here.
戴维斯 我要多方考虑 Davis, there are a lot of forces at work here.
很多内情你并不知晓 There's a lot at play that you are not privy to.
这是我的公司 请不要质疑我的运营方法 Please do not question how I choose to run my company.
当然 我只是觉得这样对你我都好 Of course, I just have to think that both of our interests
只需把达头蒂 would be better served if Bighetti was not

他这又是干什么 What is he doing now?
老天 Oh, God.
我必须再次强调 Again, I have to stress that what the monkey chooses
猴子选择如何利用科技 to do with the technology is not necessarily
与科技本身价值无关 an indictment of the technology itself.
盖文 求你了 Gavin, please!
靠墙架子上放80台GPU Okay.

中间放三台主存储器 We'll have three main cabinets in the center.
然后从洗衣机线上 I'll try and pull 220

扯220伏电压跑冷却设备 from the washer/dryer for all the cooling units.
所以你要征用整间车库吗 So you'll need this entire space then?
-是

-我把我的东西搬走

没事 我把东西搬去我车上 很快的 It's okay.

等等 贾里德 Wait, Jared, uh...
你住在车库里吗 are you living here in the garage?
是的 多奢侈 Indeed I am.

老天 真可怜 Jesus Christ, poor fucker.
在外面和啮齿动物住在一起 Sleeping out there with the rodents.
说什么呢 我车库可干净了 Hey, I keep a clean garage.
没什么啮齿动物 There are no rodents out there.
你怎么保证没有啮齿动物 How can you guarantee there are no rodents living there
你连贾里德住在里面都不知道 when you didn't even know Jared was living there?
不管是谁 都赶紧从车库里出去 I need all rodents and Jareds out of the garage.
那地方我有用 I need the space.
还有多余的电源吗 Do we have any extra power strips?
这边没什么插座 There's not a lot of outlets out there.
那里有好多人在玩桌面足球 吵死了 There are a lot of dudes playing foosball, loudly.
不用说了 我去处理 杨靖 I'll take care of that.

让你的人都出去 I need all of your guys out of there,
把那足球桌也拿走 And the foosball table.
不是我的人 Those not my guys.
他们总来这里 那都是些什么人 They're always around.

朋友的朋友 Friends of friends.
朋友的朋...

伙计们 贾里德从自己公寓退租 Guys, look, Jared gave up his own apartment
这样就能少拿点工资 给公司省钱 so he could take less salary and save the company money.
埃利希 他能住在这里吗 I mean, Erlich, can he just stay here?
因为你那可悲的管理能力 Once again, because of your poor managerial skills,
我又自讨恶果了 I've been hoisted upon my own petard.
成 让他住这吧 Yes, he can stay here.
太好了 那他住哪间 Great.

反正不能跟我住 Well, he's not staying in mine.
老子睡觉屌朝天 I sleep dick

这样的话 Okay, so then...
没戏 Uh, not it.
好吧 Okay.
-绝对没门

操 Fuck.
见鬼 Oh, shit.
早上好 室友 我帮你泡了混合咖啡 Morning, roomie.

混合咖啡 只含一半咖啡因的咖啡 针对想喝咖啡却睡不着觉的人
-理查德

我又汗湿了床单 I, um, I sweated through my sheets again.
出汗 你确定没有...

我确定 这都是汗 Yes, I'm sure.

你想过这些汗可能是从尿道里出来的吗 Do you think maybe you sweat from your urethra?
不是 我没从尿道里...

咱们还是别谈这个了 You know what?

因为谈论它只会加重...

-别说了

你什么时候学的德语 Hey, um, when did you learn to speak German?
什么 我不会德语 What?

-你确定

这些硬件才花了七万块 All this hardware for $70,000?
-没错

看看这些好东西 Oh, look at all this stuff.
那是镭7850显卡吗 我们要用它 Oh, is that a Radeon 7850?

只有我用 There's no "We."
你不干这类活 还记得吗 You don't do this kind of work, remember?
你靠头脑赚钱 不是双手 You make a living with your mind, not your hands.
-才不是

你误解我了 我喜欢硬件 You misunderstood me.

我九岁就自己组装了电脑 I made my own computer when I was nine.
自己买元件还是买的套件 From scratch or kit?
买的套件 但是我自己做了改装 It was from a kit, but I did my own mods.
-我就知道

我肯定你也很擅长手指作画 迪尼希 I'm sure you were great at fingerpainting also, Dinesh.
理查德是首席执行官 他把这活指派给了我 Richard is the CEO.

不如你这个小公主进屋写几行代码 Why don't you go inside and write some princess code?
把搬硬件的体力活留给我们这些仆人 Leave the hardware up to us servants.
我拿来了剥线器和热缩管 All right, I got the crimper and some heat shrink.
-很好

说的没错 That's right.
我能一起弄吗 拜托了 Can I help?

不行 Mmm, no.
我说过...

迪尼希 反正你是 Dinesh, you have to hack away
第一个在新系统上编程的人 on the front end of the build anyway.
-不如你就...

-有人吗

-诺亚

但看起来你们又搬回来了 But it looks like you're moving back in.
是啊 情况有点复杂 但是...

你们在里面干什么呢 What are you guys doing in there?
你们在搭建什么电脑吗 What, you building some kind of computer?
其实是服务器和数据中心 Well, more of a server/data center.
其实还挺有意思的 It's actually pretty interesting,
如果你喜欢这类东西的话 if you're into that sort of stuff.
喂 Hello?
马上闭嘴 Stop talking immediately!
进屋来 别看我 别看我 Come inside.

别看我 Don't look at me.
就跟他说你拉裤子了而且膝盖不好 Just tell him that you shit your pants and have weak knees.
你那是在干什么 What were you doing out there?
你为什么要跟他说话 Why were you talking to that person?
因为他住隔壁 我只是想搞好邻里关系 'Cause he lives next door.

邻里关系 首先 这种词根本不存在 Neighborly?

第二 永远不要跟邻居说话 Second of all, you don't talk to the neighbors, ever.
其实 跟谁都不能说 In fact, don't talk to anybody.
我们在干什么不关任何人的事 It's no one's business what we do here.
为什么会有人关心这里发生了什么 Why would anyone care what goes on in here?
因为很明显这里并未划归为办公区 'Cause we're not zoned for business, obviously.
什么叫没划成办公区 What

我刚把整个公司都搬来了 I just moved my entire business here!
你只要什么都别说就没事 You just keep your mouth shut and everything will be fine.
你知道我们这样是犯法的 You talked me into staying here even though you knew
还劝我留在这里 we were breaking the law?
抱歉 埃利希 但我很生气 I'm sorry, Erlich, but I'm pissed.
-你生我的气

我才应该生你的气 I should be pissed at you.
你知道为什么吗 You know why?
因为我送了你离别礼物 Because when one is given a parting gift
而你没走 你不应该还给我吗 and one never parts, shouldn't one return the said gift?
这不是基本的社交礼仪吗 Isn't that what decorum would dictate?
你是因为和服生气啊 Oh, this is about the kimono?
好 我现在就还给你 乐意至极 Okay, I will give it back to you right now, gladly.
现在我真的生气了 Now I'm really pissed.
因为如果你真的很珍惜这份厚礼 Because if one appreciated a gift of such magnitude,
应该在还给我前 努力争取 then one would put up more of a fight
把它留下 不是吗 before returning it, wouldn't one?
好吧 Okay.
邻居如果向 A complaint from the neighbor
规划和社区环境部投诉 to the department of Planning and Community Environment
会引来检查 进而可能收到法院传票 triggers an inspection, which can lead to a citation,
罚款 甚至扣押或没收我们的设备 fines, or even the seizure and impounding of our equipment.
那位邻居先生有能力毁了我们 That gentleman next door has the power to ruin us.
天啊 Jesus.
理查德 我能建议你少喝点红牛吗 Richard, can I suggest you take it easy on the red bulls?
它是利尿的 鉴于你的情况...

我的情况 My issue?
上帝啊 只是盗汗 贾里德 Oh, god.

不管我们决定怎么叫它 Yes, well, regardless of what we've decided on calling it,
狂灌咖啡因和糖对你都没有好处 pounding caffeine and sugar is not exactly going to help.
你知道什么会有用吗 凯格尔运动 But you know what might?

什么 What?
凯格尔运动是一种 Kegels are a form of exercise
用于增强盆底肌的练习 that strengthen the pelvic floor.
常被妇女用于产后复健 Yes, it's most commonly used by women to recover control
来紧缩阴道肌肉 of their vaginal muscles after childbirth,
它真的很有用 But it can really help,
对于"盗汗"来说 you know, "Night sweats."
我们不要再聊这个话题了 Okay, we're not going to talk about this anymore.
我现在就在做 I'm doing it right now.
收紧 放松 收紧...

停下 Stop.
你听到了吗 You hear that?
停下 关掉音乐 Stop it, hey.

快点 关掉它 还有邻居呢 Turn it

你们在逗我吧 吉尔弗约尔 Are you kidding me?

你说你会搭建好所有的服务器并让它们运行 you said that you would have all the servers up and running.
我们已经比预期晚了一周了 And we're already a week behind.
你不该忙于这个工作吗 而不是 Don't you think you should be doing that instead of,
在工作时嗑药 you know, getting high on the job?
我没有在工作时嗑药 I'm not getting high on the job.
我是在家里嗑药 I'm getting high at home.
我住在这 还记得吧 I live here, remember?
是的 好吧 好吧 Right, okay, fair enough.

但是卡尔拉不住这里 这些人也是 But Carla doesn't.

我请他们来我家做客 I'm having them over as guests, at my home.
如果你没意见的话 理查德 If that's okay with you, Richard.
这是你家 This is your home.
-是的

但你也算是在家工作 But you also work from home.
你一定觉得很混乱 That must be really confusing for you.
是的 实际上 是这样 Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
这有点...

你们觉得黑吗 Does it look dark to you guys?
伙计们 Oh, hey, guys.
伙计 怎么回事 Dude, what the fuck?
停电了 The power's out.
好吧 我想配置好一个GPU Okay, fine, I wanted to set up one GPU,
就一个 所以我打开电源 just one, and so I turned the power on
然后整个系统都启动了 再然后 and the whole system lit up.

当然启动了 你个傻逼 Yeah, it did, you dick.
因为我为了省钱在偷电 'Cause I bypassed the meter to save money
在没装好不间断电源时就接入了电网 and went directly to the feed without the UPS ready.
刚才的电涌一下就把整个系统弄瘫了 That surge just fragged the whole fucking system.
见鬼 Holy shit.
你们到底搞什么 What the hell did you guys do?
