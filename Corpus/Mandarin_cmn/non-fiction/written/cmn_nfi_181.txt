这不奇怪 我们可以让事情水落石出 That's expected.

你呢?

这个Santos在哪里?

这地方曾经的主人 Used to own the place.
不论他在哪儿 他都不会回来的 Wherever he is, he ain't coming back.
这是堕落之都 Frank This is backslide city, Frank.
我知道赌场里在发生什么 I know what's going on out there in the poker room now.
我们不只是运营夜店 对吧 We're not just running some club.

现在是 我们在谋生 What's happening now is we are surviving.
知道吗?

我们相遇的时候 你几乎脱离这一切了 You were almost out of this kind of thing when we met.
你是有规划的 It was like you had a design.
一旦有人偷走了我们所有钱 That design does not work
那个规划就实施不了了 once someone has stolen all of our money.
当我深陷泥潭时 规划也实施不了 The design does not work when I am knee

你不会想把一个孩子带到这种环境中来 You don't bring a kid into a situation like this.
什么环境?

打断一下 Excuse me?
首先 我认为这是我们俩的事 I thought this was a you and me thing, first off.
没错 但肯定有不止于此的事情 It is, but it has to be about something more than this.
天啊 Frank 我是帮了你 God, Frank, I helped, I know,
但我不想成为一个街头混混的妻子 but I don't want to be some fucking gangster's wife.
你知道那个词会让我不高兴 You know that word bothers me.
因为我没有向这个世界索求什么 Because, me, I didn't ask for this world.
我拿到了就是... "混混"吗?

我生来就处在阶级斗争的错误那一方 I was born drafted on the wrong side of a class war.
所以别说混混这种词 So fuck that gangster shit.
你现在是个拉皮条的 Frank 交易者 You're a pimp now, Frank.

我不会跟那些人混在一起 I don't mix with those people.
你知道的 You know that.
我一直都在努力挣扎 好让我们可以...

那些人 他们做的一切 不管怎样都会做 those people, everything they do, they would do anyway.
犯罪是存在于人类欲望之上的 Crime exists contingent on human desire.
这是给我留的活路 These were the avenues left me.

又或许...

你爱我 但不想支持我 you love me if you're not with me.
我理解 I understand.
但说出来 But say so
这样我们就不必提心吊胆 so we don't have to be on these goddamn eggshells.
仿佛我不是我 你不是你 Like I'm not me and you're not you.
我觉得我不会有孩子了 Frank I don't think I can have kids, Frank.
我一直假装 骗自己不是那样的 I've been pretending that it might not be that way.
我以为有可能...

但我独自找过医生 but I went to the doctor alone.
我做过不止一次 I had more than one.
我做过不止一次手术 I had more than one operation, I mean.
- 我做过三次

- 你他妈...

我们都认为我不会有孩子了 我生育不了 We don't think I can have one, a child.

你...

你 可为什么现在告诉我?

也许我现在没那么有魅力了 Maybe I'm less appealing in current circumstances.
为什么不在我当时最得意的时候告诉我这个?

现在 我是我 Well, now I'm me.
你是你了 And you're you.
现在我们都打开天窗说亮话了 And here we both are out in the open.
所以谁爱谁?

这只鸡看起来不错 This chicken looks good.
你用了那本食谱还是...

- 是的

是的 我希望成品跟她做的一样好 I did.

- 给

- 哦

谢谢 Thank you.
我们在说 生完孩子后 You know, we were just saying that it'd be a good idea
让妈咪来住段时间是个好主意 for Mami to come stay with us a while after the baby comes.
婚礼呢?

你正在筹备 要加快速度啊 You're doing it, get on with it.
你会希望我在这里的 And you're gonna want me here.
你不知道自己面对的是什么 You have no idea what you're in for.
夜长梦多啊 Long nights.

也许会有点挤 Might get kind of cramped.
我睡客厅的沙发 我不会抱怨的 I'll take the sofa in the living room.

我四岁时 在船上待了一整个星期 我都没抱怨 An entire week on a boat, I'm four.

在船体下层八天 Down in the hull eight days.
- 妈妈

他会逮捕我吗?

感谢上苍 你不用骑摩托车了 Thank Jesus they got you off that motorcycle.
好多了 现在你穿西装了 Much better.

他很帅 He's very handsome.
几个月前 A couple of months back.
我说起领养的事情 When I talked about adoption.
Jordan 我不想...

我一直在想 你还小的时候 I was thinking about you as a kid,
要是有人照顾你 what it would have meant
那会怎么样呢?

要是有人照顾你 If somebody had taken care of you.
现在说已经晚了 There's no bandwidth for that right now.
我跟你一起 Frank I'm with you, Frank.
我爱你 I love you.
但我不想看见你迷失现在的自己 But I don't want to see you lose who you've become.
我说的不是钱 And I don't mean the money.
我想谢谢你这样看待我 And I want to thank you for seeing me like that.
你现在一定要这么活着 让我崩溃 It fucking tears me up the way you're having to live now.
我的问题是 你不上床 My problem is with you not coming to bed.
我们俩每天晚上都喝得烂醉 With both of us being half in the bag each night.
我会找到解决方式 I will find a way out.
领养的事 你态度很明确 The adoption, you were so definite.
我想你是在跟曾经孩童时的自己说不 I think you were saying no to the kid that you once were.
你当时说是别人的问题 You were saying he was somebody else's problem.
我要回家了 I'm going home.
你应该花点时间跟我在一起 You should make some time to join me.
# 很难醒来...

在证物室查了一整天 Spent all day in state's evidence control.
然后去了Vinci警局 Then Vinci PD.
没有人知道 Nobody had an answer.
凭空消失了 They just vanished.
好吧 看着很像 Well, looks like them.
但这些可以在Caspere死之前就被拿走的 But these would have to be taken before Caspere died.
最近怎么样?

酒喝得更多了 Drinking more.
我的手已经废了 My hands get fucked up.
不停颤抖 你呢?

跟自己说了很多 Talking to myself a lot.
又开始嗜酒 算是个变化吧 Sticking to booze, though.

那么Caspere保险箱里的钻石不在证物室了 So the diamonds from Caspere's safe deposit went missing from evidence.
也不是不可能发生的 It ain't exactly unheard of.
这个女孩消失了 This girl's missing.
就在Caspere的尸体出现之前不久 Disappeared shortly before Caspere's body turned up.
那些援交聚会 我们听说的都是?

有势力的人 Powerful men.
我不能找出所有人 但这是州参议员 I couldn't make them all, but that's a state senator.
看这个 Look at this one.
是Caspere Caspere.
这种聚会肯定不许拍照的 This ain't the type of party allows cameras.
你怎么看?

你真的以为我们理清了Caspere的案子吗?

那些墨西哥人?

他们手里有Caspere家里的东西 They had items from Caspere's house there.
还有指纹 你在乎他们?

是这些人把你困在笼里的 Bezzerides These people put you in a cage, Bezzerides.
这个女孩失踪了 This girl's gone missing.
没人在乎 Nobody cares.
