我在客厅里发现了更多血斑 I found some more blood spots in the hall, too.
和鞋印吻合 Shoe prints match.
所以 妻子雇凶杀人 So, wife gets someone to do the deed.

顺便说一句 从海军研究办公室那里 By the way, got a response
得到了回复 from the Office of Naval Research.
"考虑到中校 "Given the access
所拥有的权限 我们担心 "the commander had, we are concerned
敏感信息可能 "about the sensitive information
从他的家用电脑里泄露" that might have been taken off his home computer."
如果他们担心 If they're concerned,
我想知道他们担心的是谁 I want to know who they're concerned about.
你们两个去ONR You two go to ONR.
我去跟那个2万美金的妻子谈谈 I'll talk to the $20,000 wife.
你们调查了我的银行记录 You looked into my bank records?
是的 We did.
可以解释一下 Mind explaining why...
你上周为什么提取2万美金么 you withdrew $20,000 last week?

看起来不是给我的 Not for me, it seems.
除非你要逮捕我 Unless you'd like to arrest me...

我们都十分震惊 We're...

Wilson中校和Rebecca Commander Wilson and Rebecca were...
都是很棒的人 amazing people.
Wilson中校在军中 Commander Wilson had...
前途光明 a bright future in the service.
中校知道哪些敏感情报 What kind of sensitive Intel was the commander privy to?
无人机 导弹防御 Drones, missile defense,
所有最新的技术 all the latest technology.
Wilson中校出现过任何问题 或泄露过情报么 Any issues there or breaches of intelligence with Commander Wilson?
我也很想具体谈谈 Well, I'd love to talk specifics,
但那些信息是机密 but that information's classified.
你能告诉我们什么 Is there anything you could offer us?
Darby和Rebecca去年和一个私人国防承包商 Darby and Rebecca spent much of the past year on

合作了很久 with a private defense contractor.
Axelrod工业公司 Uh, Axelrod Industries.
如果有什么问题 你应该跟他们谈谈 If there were issues, they'd be someone you should talk to.
还有一个问题 One other question.
你是否感觉Wilson中校 Did you get a sense that Commander Wilson
和Ortega女士有超出工作的关系 and Ms.

抱歉 上将需要您签字 Um, excuse me.

Darby和Rebecca十分亲密 但是 Darby and Rebecca were close, but...
鉴于我们严格的信息披露政策 given our strict disclosure policies,
他们如果恋爱 需要向我们汇报 they'd have to come to us with a relationship.
或保持地下恋情 Or keep it an office secret.
我想万事皆有可能 I suppose anything's possible.
我们需要打包标记 We're going to need to bag and tag
文件 平板电脑 the files, the tablet,
中校办公室的所有东西 everything in the commander's office.
请等一下 Excuse me.
女士 Miss?
我是NCIS的特别探员Brody Special Agent Brody with NCIS.
我在想 你是否想告诉我什么事 I was wondering if there was something you might want to tell me.
我 我没有 I...

恰好那个时刻需要签字么 Just needed a signature at that exact moment?
那么赶时间 Time

Darby和Rebecca之间没有什么 There was nothing going on between Darby and Rebecca.
你怎么知道 How do you know that?
因为我才是那个地下恋情 Because I'm the office secret.
你和Darby You and Darby?
我和Becca Me and Becca.
Darby和Becca十分亲密 Darby and Becca were very close.
他们工作到非常晚 They worked crazy hours together.
她有时候睡在他那儿 但是相信我 She slept there some nights, but trust me...
Rebecca不喜欢他 ...Rebecca wasn't into him.
我太痛苦了 I'm in so much pain.
我们彼此相爱 而现在她...

她...

走了 ...gone.
对于您的损失 我非常抱歉 I'm so sorry for your loss.
所以并没有婚外情 So there was no affair?
不代表他妻子也这么认为 Which doesn't mean the wife didn't think there was.
对于那次取款 我想了解更多信息 And I'd like to know more about that withdrawal.
但我认为 这位女士不会凭直觉 But she didn't strike me as the kind of lady that would...
就干掉两个人的 bump off two people on a hunch.
啊 说起直觉 Ah, speaking of hunches

我不知道这意味着什么 and I don't know what this means

但我在中校的右手腕上 but I found a small patch of a sticky substance
找到了一小片黏性物质 on the commander's right wrist.
测试过了么 Run any tests?
用最传统的方式 嗅觉 The old

-烟草

这很奇怪 Which is odd,
因为中校有我见过的最干净的肺叶 because the commander has the cleanest lungs I've ever seen.
不禁使人好奇 它为什么出现在那儿 又来自哪里 Makes you wonder why is it there, and where exactly did it come from?
Sebastian正在进一步化验凝胶 Sebastian's running further tests that resin
以得到更多信息 so we could learn more.
谁都别动 Nobody move.

咱这是干嘛呢 What are we doing?
试图抵抗最高统治者 Trying to beat back the prying eyes

Sebastian Sebastian.
抱歉 这是我的反黑客程序 Sorry.

如果有人试图从我手机里窃取信息 When someone tries to steal information from my phone,
这程序就会嘀嘀响 它在告诉我 the app starts beeping, and it's telling me
黑客源头就在这个房间里 that the source of the hack is somewhere in this room.

在尸体里 In the body?
是的 那儿 Yeah.

就在那儿 Right...

我正好要检查胃容物 I was just about to check the contents of the stomach anyway.
噢 Oh.
有东西嵌到了胃粘膜里 Something's imbedded in the stomach lining.
看起来像是微芯片 Looks like a microchip.
我可以看一下么 May I see that for a second?
噢 哇哦 Oh, wow.
说真的 哇哦 Seriously, like, wow.
我听说过这种东西正在研发当中 I

但亲眼看到一个...

看到一个什么 Sebastian See one what, Sebastian?
一个生物追踪器 Uh, a biotracker.
这是一种间谍工具 It's a spy tool

用来植入另一个人的身体中 something that you put inside another person.
当那人靠近电脑或电话之类的电子信号时 And then when that person is near an electronic signal,
这个生物追踪器就会从信号中窃取信息 like a computer or a phone, the biotracker steals that signal.
窃听电话 拦截邮件 Phone calls are tapped, e

就像吞下了一个记录装置 Like swallowing a recording device?
-没错

Wilson中校被人监视了 Commander Wilson was being spied on?
我的确是说Wilson中校被监视了 I am saying that Commander Wilson was being spied on...
被自己体内的东西监视了 from inside his own body.
生物追踪器是生物学和电子学的完美结合 Biotracker is the purest fusion of biology and electronics.
有一系列技术 There's a whole branch of tech
用来制造这样的疯狂产品 devoted to craziness just like this.
对我们来说 这是当下最潮的东西 It's all the rage with guys like me.
和你一样的黑客们 Hackers like you.
是计算机调查专家 Investigative computer specialists.
完全是正当职业 Too legit to quit.
有首歌叫 演唱者是MC Hammer
好了 MC Hamme Okay, MC Hammer,
怎么把生物追踪器植入人体 how do you get a biotracker into someone?
如你所见 它们非常小 Well, as you can see, they're very tiny.
通常被藏在药片里 Normally, they're hidden in a pill.
有没有可能 是他自己吞下去的 Any chance he could have swallowed it himself?
不可能 除非他疯了 Not unless he's a crazy

这些东西没有经过检验 它们很危险 Those things are not tested;

Wilson中校在服用胆固醇药 Commander Wilson was on cholesterol meds.
也许有人把生物追踪器 Maybe somebody slipped the biotracker
-藏在那里面了

他们可能在多个药片里植入追踪器 they might have planted trackers in multiple pills.
就像除芝士以外的所有东西 Like anything other than...

生物追踪器几天内就可以排出体外 biotrackers can pass through your system within days.
所以生物追踪器窃取的信息 So the info the biotracker steals
可以被发送到某个地方 你能追踪信息的下落么 can be transmitted somewhere

不 超出我的超级能力范围了 Nah.

不过 But this is not
这不像是一个妒妇会用的东西 something a jealous wife would be using?
除非这个妻子 Not unless she's a wife with
有数百万的科研经费 multimillions in research funding.
ONR的人就有这等资源 The people who work with the ONR have those resources.
Wilson被派遣去的地方 And the place Wilson was assigned

-Axelrod工业公司也有

你俩查一下 除了他妻子 You two figure out who, other than his wife,
还有谁能接触到他的药物 had access to his meds.
你对Wilson的电脑处理得怎么样了 How you doing with Wilson's computer?
噢 我已经进去了 Oh, I'm into it.
我跟你说 I'll tell you what,
这小家伙守口如瓶 this puppy is buttoned up tighter than a...
比一只非常...

好吧 我把自己绕迷糊了 Okay, I got lost in the middle of that one.
Pride探员 欢迎 Agent Pride.

我是Oscar Randolph 安全主管 Oscar Randolph, head of security.
抱歉得扫一下 Got to do this sweep.

我理解 Understood.
目前 我们想要尽可能了解 At this point, we're trying to learn everything we can about the work
Wilson中校参与的工作 Commander Wilson was involved in.
好的 Right.

他是我们许多海军项目的中间人 on a number of projects we were building for the Navy.
Darby负责协助我们 Darby was charged with helping us
把工作项目合并进海军系统 integrate the work into the Navy's systems.
激光直升机助降系统 Laser

超高速导弹系统 hypervelocity missile system...
生物追踪器呢 How about biotrackers?
不在我们工作范围内 Not on our radar.
但它们很酷 But they're cool.
Pride探员 你认为他们被杀 Agent Pride, do you think they were killed
是由于Darby在这里工作 because of Darby's work here?
我们正在调查所有可能性 We're exploring all possibilities.
你的担忧也很正常 You'd be right to be concerned.
我的下属都经历过很多事情 My employees have had issues in the past.
例行尝试入侵我们的系统 Routine attempts at hacking into our system,
-勒索 间谍

从基地组织到北京的红色黑客联盟 From al

我们的员工都是袭击对象 Our employees have targets on their backs

所以我们尽全力保护他们的人身安全 we do everything in our power to keep them safe.
但事实就是 我们的研发技术 But the truth is, the technologies we develop
是最前沿的 are the cutting edge.
大家不惜性命 试图获取我们的技术 They're worth killing for

必须得承认 a fact we're, admittedly,
我们为此感到十分骄傲 quite proud of.
我的问题是 Here's my problem.
要调查不存在的东西 实在很困难 It's hard to investigate what's not there anymore.
Darby的整个系统 Darby's entire system was wiped remotely
在他死前三小时被清空了 three hours after his death.
全都没了 So all gone?
没了 但不是真的消失了 Gone, but not really gone.
你看 东西永远不会彻底消失的 See, gone is never totally gone.
我可以用 I use some...
编译器代码 比如包嗅探器 compiler code, maybe a packet sniffer.
如果幸运的话 If I'm lucky,
就能找到"零天攻击"的漏洞 I'll find a zero day exploit.
我在假装我明白 And here's where I pretend like I know
-你说的话

我会全力以赴 I'm gonna be on it,
就像一位骑自行车的女士 like a woman on a bicycle,
心中有着目标 with somewhere to go.
你真不擅长做类比 Analogies are not your strong suit.
实验室叫我们 The lab wants us.
午安 朋友们 Afternoon, friends.
Lund先生 Mr.

Plame先生 Mr.

我最爱的"阴谋论者"怎么样了 How's my favorite conspiracy theorist doing?
我更喜欢"创意现实主义者" I prefer the term "creative realist."
我认识的现实主义者一般不会认为 Well, not many realists I know believe that the government
政府在51区研发时间旅行技术 is developing time travel technology in Area 51.
美国一处空军基地 据称与不明飞行物阴谋论有关
我认识的怀疑论者多半也拿不到 Yeah, not many skeptics I know have read
我拥有的被涂改文件 所以...

你叫我们有事么 There is a reason you called?
是的 Wilson手腕上的物质 Yes.

其实是烟草黏液凝胶 was, in fact, tobacco resin.
我分离了其中的可替宁 I isolated the cotinine properties
尼古丁的主要代谢产物
发现这种 and found that this particular type,
名为Romman Shisha的烟草 十分罕见 the Romman Shisha, is somewhat rare.
而且也仅用于水烟 It's also only used for hookah smoking.
本地只有几个地方售卖 It's only sold in a few local spots.
这种凝胶可以轻易被擦掉 And the resin can be wiped out quite easily,
却仍留在Wilson中校身上 but it was still on Commander Wilson,
说明他应该是死前几小时内 which means he likely encountered it
才接触到这种烟草 within hours of his death.
没错 所以我用Lasalle下载的 Yeah, so I grabbed the log that Lasalle downloaded
Wilson中校车载GPS记录 from the GPS in Commander Wilson's car,
与城里的水烟坊进行交叉比对 and I cross

看好咯 boom

Boom啥 Boom what?
Boom

我在寻找合适的词 I'm working on catchphrases
来表示有重大发现 to punctuate meaningful discoveries.
在此案中 这个发现就是...

Wilson中校在身亡前一天晚上10点 That Commander Wilson parked his car near a place called
把车停在了一个名叫"撒哈拉室"的地方 the Sahara Room at 10:

在水烟坊的深夜会谈 Late meeting in a hookah bar?
-一个非吸烟者

也还是很奇怪 at Area 51, but still it's odd.
够了 我跟你说 那是真的...

这一切跟生物追踪器 And how this is all connected with the world
-和高科技有什么关系

不过值得深入调查 Sebastian but it's worth looking into.

在 Yeah?
把那个水烟坊的地址发给我 Send me the address to that hookah bar.
明白 I got you.
这是"撒哈拉东"的监控录像 Surveillance camera footage from Sahara East.
水烟坊主说Wilson中校在那里 Hostess says Commander Wilson was there
跟这个人见面 meeting this guy.
他们的交谈十分激烈 They were having an intense conversation.
但坊主听不到内容 因为他们压低了声音 But hostess couldn't hear them, 'cause they were whispering.
他看起来就像烧焦的棉花糖 He looks like a burnt marshmallow.
摄像头上蒙了厚厚一层灰 Camera had an inch of dust over the lens.
就连Bruce也没法子 Even Bruce is stumped.
Bruce能修好那辆车么 Think Bruce could fix the car?
只有我叫他Bruce Only I call him Bruce.
Pride考虑过请个机修工么 Pride ever consider a mechanic?
我问了 他说不 I asked.

我不明白 虽然我认识Pride才几个月 I don't get it.

但是如果他真心想把车子修好...

他就不会 He wouldn't be
因为我把机修工号码给他而发火 snapping at me for giving him the number of my mechanic.
他来了 Incoming.
监控录像上有什么线索么 Anything on the surveillance video?
没 没有 长官 啥也木有 Nope.

问题 Wilson见到神秘男人时 确切是几点 Question:

时间戳显示 是谋杀案前一晚10:

Wilson的妻子提到 Wilson's wife mentioned meeting her husband
在那天早些时候见过她丈夫 earlier that same day.
不知道Wilson是否跟她说了晚上的会面 Wonder if Wilson told her anything about his other meeting.
问问总没错 Never hurts to ask.
-Christopher

Christopher 我找到追赶Wilson中校的车了 Christopher, I got the car that chased Commander Wilson
停在Wilson夫人的住所前 parked in front of the wife's house.
-需要支援

海军罪案调查处 NCIS.
-你没事吧

好 待在这儿 All right, stay here.
你还好么 You okay?
我完全不明白怎么会这样 I don't get any of this.
那个人杀了我丈夫 The

现在又来杀我 is also coming after me?
目前 我们主要在考虑 At the moment, we're focused on the possibility that
可能是你丈夫的工作 something about your husband's work
导致他被杀害 was the reason for his death.
他有没有告诉过你什么 Is there anything he might have told you
或者在你家留下什么 或者让你保管 or left at your house or

任何可能带来危险的东西 could put you in danger?
不 他已经好几周没来过我家了 No.

而且我们根本不怎么说话 and we don't really talk much.
更不会聊他的工作 Certainly not about his work.
根据Wilson夫人的描述 已经发布通缉令 BOLO's out based on Mrs.

正在进行地面和空中搜寻 Got eyes on the ground and in the air.
别担心 夫人 我们会抓住凶手的 Don't worry, ma'am, we'll find the guy.
Katherine 我需要你再好好回想一下 Katherine, I need you to remember anything you can.
一切都发生得太快了 Uh, it just happened really fast.
我在努力想 我...

我回到家 I came home, and...
他已经在那儿了 he was there.
他抓住我的头发 然后他...

-抱歉

没事的 你现在安全了 It's all right.

-最后一个问题

你最后一次见到你丈夫时 The last time you saw your husband,
他有没有说过 did he mention anything about meeting someone
之后要和别人见面 later in the day?
Shang 他是个...

有个人叫Shang Someone named Shang.

Wilson说是个同事 said he was a colleague.
好 很好 All right, all right,
非常不错 that's good, that's good.
在通缉令中加上Shang Add Shang to the BOLO.
我和ONR谈谈 And I'll talk to ONR.
交叉比对Wilson同事的名字 Cross

两起谋杀 Yeah.

还有对Wilson夫人的谋杀未遂 and an attempt on Mrs.

我觉得应该把她送去安全屋 I think it's time maybe we move her to the safe house
直到把凶手绳之以法 till the killer's in custody.
我会安排 I'll set it up.
让Brody帮她收拾行李 Have Brody pack her a bag.
没问题 King You got it, King.
你可以后退几步吗 You mind taking a couple steps back?
以防万一 Just a precaution.
我小时候也有一个这样的收音机 I used to have a radio like this growing up.
父母吵架时 我就把它开得超大声 Turn it up real loud when my parents would argue.
妈妈酗酒 爸爸大吵大嚷 音乐能让一切都好过些 Mom drank too much, Dad yelled and the music just made it easier.
好了 There.
我喜欢那首歌 I love that song.
Darby不喜欢音乐 Darby didn't like music.
他向来一本正经 直入正题 He was no

我遇见他时 很爱他这点 Which, when I met him, I loved.
但是相处久了 But time passes
你当初爱上的那些不同点 and the differences you fell in love with just...
就变成了隔阂 oh, start to be differences.
你结婚了 You're married.

嗯 感情破裂时 Yeah, it's tough
日子很难熬 when things get broken.

那些情报专家 The intelligence specialists

他们拿了我的土豆沙拉 they took my potato salad,
都没问过我 didn't even ask.
少来了 Come on.
你不吃土豆沙拉 Well, you don't eat potato salad,
我没吃 而King不在这儿 I didn't eat it, and King ain't here.

我们中间出了贼 We got thieves in our midst.

这位是Shang Lee Meet Shang Lee.
Wilson中校的同事 Commander Wilson's colleague.
Wilson在水烟坊里的朋友 Wilson's friend from the hookah bar.
Shang以前就职于Axelrod工业公司 Shang used to work at Axelrod Industries

技术官 technology officer.
Axelrod先生说他一年前开除了Shang Mr.

控告他企图把蓝图卖给竞争对手 Accused him of trying to sell blueprints to a competitor.
那个生物追踪器可能与此有关 Could be what the biotracker is about.
试图了解Wilson在Axelrod公司的工作内容 An attempt to learn what Wilson was working on
这样Shang就可以转售 at Axelrod so Shang could resell it.
-也许被Wilson发现了...

-Shang Lee现在在哪儿

我们会逮到他的 Well, let's find him.
以及偷了我土豆沙拉的家伙 And whoever stole my potato salad.
存在着数十亿星系 There are billions of galaxies out there.
你怎么能不相信外星生命的存在呢 How can you not believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life?
有数十亿生命成长的机会 I mean, there are billions of opportunities for life to grow.
-数十亿的...

不是让你一直说"数十亿"的 not to say "billions" a billion times.
我们不可能是宇宙中唯一的星球 We just...

其居住者在天空下起舞 你明白吗 whose inhabitants get their celestial groove on, you know?
其鱼儿逆流而上 Whose fish swim upstream.
其唯一目的 Whose sole purpose
就是繁育延续紊乱的物种 is to procreate and continue a dysfunctional species.
Wilson电脑上有什么进展 Any progress with Wilson's computer?
就快好了 Sebastian有个很不错的主意 We're getting there.

土豆沙拉 Potato salad.
来点儿不 Want some?
为了破解加密的51区文件 So, to get into encrypted Area 51 files,
黑客使用了一种神经网络解密算法 hackers used a neural network decryption algorithm.
"据称如此" 无论如何 Allegedly.

我们对中校的电脑应用了 we applied the same algorithm to the commander's
-同样算法

Boom

这个...

Boom

不准再提了 Don't ever say that again.
好吧 All right.
我们有Wilson的下载记录 We got Commander Wilson's download history.
他最后一次下载是在8:

他在SD卡里存了一些文件 He put some files on an SD card.
文件是什么内容 What was on the files?
我们还不知道 文件进行了多重加密 We don't know yet

看起来是机密信息 Looked like some classified stuff.
不过我们很快就能破解了 But we're getting into it.
第二轮 Seconds?
我得承认 食物还不赖 I got to admit, the food's not terrible.
过奖 High praise.
你拿的是什么 What you got there?
在橱柜里发现的 Found it in the cabinet.
这不是个安全屋么 Thought this was a secure safe house.
我们和其他机构共用 We share it with other agencies.
不能担保所有人都守规矩 Can't vouch for everyone.
-我可以...

不 我带着枪呢 No.

这次就免了 Got to take a pass.
Darby曾经上过一次烹饪课 Darby took a cooking class once.
简直糟糕极了 He was so bad.
我是说 他真的尽力了 I mean, he really tried.

他想学我最爱的菜肴 红酒牛肉 He wanted to learn my favorite food

在我生日的时候表现一下 and cook it for my birthday.
听起来是个好男人 Sounds like a good guy.
确实是 He was.
我不想结束 I didn't want it to end.
和Darby的关系 With Darby.
而离婚 The divorce was...
是我们唯一的选择 all we could think to do.
几周前 我想注册 Couple weeks ago, I tried signing up for an online
在线约会服务 dating service,
但当我填写个人资料的时候 but when I went to complete the profile, I...
我实在做不到 couldn't do it.
不知为什么 这一步 甚至超过了离婚 Somehow that step

感觉像是...

一条 A line you...
迈过去就无法回头的线 just can't uncross.
你懂我 You get it.
Katherine Katherine.
我...

-我得处理这个

一个马夫发现了他 One of the stable hands found him.
为马钉蹄铁的时候 闻到了这股难闻的味道 Was shoeing a horse, noticed this horrible smell.
就像是...

-经常使用这些马厩么

这是个藏东西的好地方 This is a great place to hide something you don't want found.
谢谢你 先生 Thank you, sir.
就是这股味道 There's the smell.
绝对是...

下午好 Loretta Good afternoon, Loretta.
Brody Christopher 来见见Shang Lee Brody, Christopher, come meet Shang Lee in the flesh.
腐烂如斯 Rotting as it is.
我们发现他淹没在这个臭水槽里 We found him submerged in this trough of fetid water.
死因是胸口的两枪 Cause of death is two gunshot wounds to the chest.
口径应该是9毫米 Caliber appears to be nine millimeter.
和杀害Rebecca Ortega的武器一样 Same weapon that killed Rebecca Ortega.
我会让Sebastian核对弹道 但我猜测 I'll have Sebastian check ballistics, but I'm guessing...
弹痕会匹配 Striations match.
死亡时间 Time of death?
根据腐烂 肿胀和变色情况判断 我认为 Based on decomp, bloating and lividity, I'd say Shang Lee
Shang Lee比其他两名受害者要早遇害几个小时 died hours before the other two victims.
也许该打给Pride Might want to call Pride.
告诉他凶手仍然逍遥法外 Tell him the killer's still on the loose.
好 就这么办 Yeah.

看来这通电话意味着 危险尚未结束 I take it that call doesn't mean the danger's over?
还没有 Not yet, no.
趴下 Get down!
现在怎么办 So, what happens now?
不管凶手是谁 If...

如果他能在那么偏僻的地方找到你 can find you out here in the middle of nowhere,
那我们带你回办公室更好 it's better we bring you back to the office.
更安全 More security.
我们将对你进行24小时监控 We'll keep you under 24

听着 我...

很抱歉之前...

别在意 Don't give it another thought.
我能问你个问题么 Can I ask you a question?
你那条手链是哪儿来的 Where'd you get that bracelet?
Darby送的 我30岁生日 Darby, my 30th.
你的耳环呢 Your earrings?
-也是Darby送的

这是我唯一能带的首饰 It's the only kind of jewelry I can wear
带别的材质我会起疹子 without breaking into hives.
那个盒式吊坠就是银质的 That's what the locket was made of.
很明显不是给Rebecca的 It clearly was not for Rebecca.
它和你其它首饰都相配 It matches everything else you wear, and...
-你觉得他...

而且也许 And maybe
它成了藏东西的完美之处 it became the perfect hiding place for something else.
他逃命时携带的唯一东西 The only thing he took as he ran for his life
就是那条吊坠 was the necklace.
而SD卡可以非常小 And an SD card can be very small.
Pride说再检查一遍盒式吊坠 Pride says recheck the locket.
他不是在现场就检查过了么 I thought he checked it at the scene.
里面什么都没有 Nothing in here.
一张SD卡能有多大 How big is an SD card?
差不多像拇指的指甲那么大 Can be about the size of your thumbnail.
这东西卡住了 This thing's stuck.
-我能试试么

我母亲总担心丢失她的吊坠 So, my mother was always worried about losing her locket.
对于打不开的卡扣 她都是这么办的 This is what she would do with a faulty clasp.
好了 Mm.

看来里面有什么东西 Looks like there's something in there.
姐姐厉害吧 How do you like them apples?
给我瞧瞧 Let me get that, kids.
我们看看这些杀戮究竟是为了什么 Let's see what all this killing is about.
好 开始了 Okay.

这特么是啥 What the hell is this?
不妙啊 So, that ain't good.
等等 Wait a minute.
这里还有个文件 There's another file on here.
是个没写完的备忘录 It's a memo.

是Wilson身亡前两天 Dated two days before Wilson's death...
要发给海军的 to the Navy.
有一封带有Axelord导弹系统视频的邮件 Wilson was accidentally cc'd
不小心抄送给了Wilson on an e

导弹定位系统出了问题 There's a defect with the targeting mechanism,
但他在等另一个人的意见 而非立刻向上级报告 but he's waiting on a second opinion before notifying his superior officer.
Shang Lee可能就是他在等的那个人 Shang Lee could have been that second opinion.
他知道Axelord如何运作 He knew how Axelrod worked.
他们在铲除一切后患 They're cleaning up all their loose ends,
也因为如此 他们想除掉Katherine which is probably why they went after Katherine.
她在Wilson死前一天 在家见过他 She met with Wilson at his house the day before he died.
他们一定是担心 Wilson跟她说了什么 Must be scared they told her something.
没错 但问题是 Yeah, but the question is:
究竟是Axelrod里的谁 把事情搞砸了 Who at Axelrod screwed up big

发了那封邮件 然后试图掩盖痕迹 sent that e

我查查看 I'm on it.
太棒了 把设计规格发给我 This is great.

NCIS 不许动 NCIS.

你们干什么 Whoa.

嘿 Hey.
Schwartz小姐 你得跟我们走一趟 Miss Schwartz, you need to come with us.
等等 什么 Wait.

Jason 我相信一定是哪里出错了 Jason, I'm sure this is a terrible mistake.
简直太疯狂了 我不知道你们在想什么 This is insane.

但我可以保证 你们抓错人了 but I can promise you, you have the wrong person.
等一下再说吧 Hold that thought, please.
你认识他么 You recognize him?
允许我帮你恢复一下记忆 Allow me to refresh your memory.
Oscar Randolph 你们公司的安全主管 Oscar Randolph, head of security for your company,
在意识到Wilson中校无意间接收了 the man you e

那封导弹测试失败的邮件后十分钟 Commander Wilson had accidentally
你给Oscar发了邮件 received the failed missile test.
前准军事部队 训练有素的杀手 Ex

有使用九毫米手枪和狙击步枪的经验 experience using nine

鞋码与我们发现的脚印相符 Shoe size matches the prints we found.
而且他干净利索地坦白了一切 And he sings like a canary.
比如往中校办公室的胆固醇药片里 About biotrackers in cholesterol meds
放生物追踪器 kept at work,
比如雇凶杀人 murder for hire,
还有如果导弹生意败北 and lost million

就会失去的百万奖金 if a missile deal were to go south.
交易是这样的 如果你在Pride探员进来前坦白 Here's the deal.

我们会告诉法官宽大处理 如果你保持沉默 and we'll tell the judge to show leniency;

就祈祷不会被判死刑吧 Take your chances with the needle.
好好 求求你们 Okay, please, please, please.
你要知道 我从来没让他去杀Rebecca You have to know, I never told him to kill Rebecca.
她本不该在那儿 She wasn't supposed to be there.
你会告诉法官这个吧 You'll tell the judge that, right?
Randolph先生在那儿 他要找律师 Mr.

他什么也不肯说 He's not talking.
等等 什么 Wait.

是的 我们的谈话 Yep.

没什么成效 不过倒是给了我点时间 wasn't very fruitful, but it did give me
整理了一下购物清单 time to put together my grocery list.
需要什么吗 Need anything?
Katherine Katherine?
你现在可以回家了 You can go home now.
结束了么 It's over?
什么也不需要担心 Nothing else to worry about.
我得说 I got to say, though,
保护性监禁也有它的好处 protective custody has its advantages.
陪同的伙伴真不错 Company wasn't half bad.
噢 我觉得你可能想要这个 Oh.

很好看 Looks nice.
Dardy品味不错 Darby had good taste.
我该走了 I should go.
你还在弄这个呢 You still at it?
是啊 车子很顽固 Yeah.

顽固的不只是车子 That ain't the only thing.
我在想 你为什么还没有修好车 I've been thinking why you haven't fixed the car yet.
你有什么见解 What'd you come up with?
如果车不好使 Linda会一直打给你 Well, if the car doesn't work, Linda's gonna keep calling.
她就一直存在于的生活中 Keeps her in your life.
一旦修好了 就没什么理由打电话了 Once it's fixed, less reason to call.
啊 Ah.
不是要还给Linda的 我要卖掉它 Not going to Linda.

她收拾了东西 Yeah, packed her things,
关上家门 去她姐姐家了 closed up the house, went to her sister's.
我们都认为这是最好的选择 We both decided it was for the best.
就这样了么 So, is this permanent?
怎么能不爱这声音 Don't you love the sound of that?
兜个风不 Go for a ride?
你让我开车么 You gonna let me drive?
门儿都没有 Not a chance.
