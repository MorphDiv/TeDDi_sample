《小镇疑云》前情回顾 Previously on Gracepoint...
你得改变 卸下所有压力 You have to change all this.

否则你会死的 If you don't, you'll end up dead.
是我妈妈 It's about mom.
我昨天去提款机取钱 分文不剩 I went to the bank machine yesterday.

-想暂时摆脱烦恼吗

账户余额 透支1011元 可用余额0元
你邀请他来吃顿晚餐 Why don't you invite him to dinner?
-邀请谁来吃晚餐

他当时在船上 或是被放在了船 It's like he was in a boat, or he was put in a boat.
-马克 你有船吗

这边有什么发现 What have we got here?
这是拍到丹尼在加油站的录像 Danny in the gas station,
正如迪恩所说 just like Dean said.
你还认定他的罪只有出轨吗 You're still sure that's all he's guilty of?
还觉得他与此事毫无关系 He's got nothing to do with this?
我不知道 I don't know.
向我保证你没有别的事瞒着我 Promise me there's nothing else I don't know about.
就在这 He's here.
一艘夜间行船报的警 One of the night boats called it in.
没有迹象表明船里有人 No sign of anyone on it.
我们应该找谁 Who do we call?
港务局还是海岸警卫队 The Harbor Master, Coastguard?
他们得去把每一块碎片都捞回来 I need people out there collecting every piece.
现在在涨潮 残骸很快就会被冲走 The tide's coming in.

不行 都得给我捞回来 No, get it done!
打给港务局 Call the Harbor Master.
我需要一队人到北沙滩来打捞残骸 I need a marine crew to north beach.
贝丝·索拉诺
我睡不着 I couldn't sleep.
我能理解 That's understandable.
昨天你在场 看到马克有多生气了 You saw yesterday.

我觉得你俩都很生气 I think you're both angry.
你们排除他的嫌疑了吗 Have you ruled him out?
贝丝 现在可是凌晨四点 Beth, it's 4:

那名背包客呢 Well, what about the backpacker?
还不清楚 We don't know yet.
艾莉 求你告诉我 Ellie, please tell me something.
马克被你们审问了一整天 You had Mark in for a whole day.
接着也没有任何说法 Then without saying anything,
你们就继续调查其他人 you move on to these other guys.
至少告诉我 我丈夫还是不是嫌犯 At least tell me if my husband is still a suspect.
事情远没有这么简单 It's not that simple.
就这么简单 It is very simple.
你们认为是他杀了丹尼吗 Do you think he killed Danny?
我不这么认为 I don't.
但他当天的行踪有一段空白 But there were gaps in his movements
我们想让他解释清楚 we needed to know about
可他拒绝配合 that he did not want...

什么时候的行踪 丹尼死的那晚吗 Movements when?

-贝丝

你最好自己去问他 You need to ask him.
你们 I saw him
放他走的那晚 with Gemma Fisher
我看到他和嘉玛·费舍在一起 the same night you let him go.
马克知道你看到他们了吗 Does Mark know that?
贝丝 你得告诉他 Beth, you have to...

和他谈谈 You have to talk to him.
天呐 Oh, God.
那是保罗吗 Is that Paul?
他站那多久了 How long has he been standing there?
半夜这个点他为什么醒着 Why is he awake at this time of night?
有一大半都烧焦了 Over half of it was burnt.
现场调查员正在处理剩下的残骸 CSI's going through what's left.
你起晚了 You're up late.
怎么回事 你们怎么又来了 What's going on?

想要知道案件的最新进展 You wanted up

你就该料到会常常见到我们 You should expect to see a lot of us.
昨天深夜有人在港口点燃了一艘船 Someone lit a boat on fire out in the harbor late last night.
不过不是我的船 我的船还停在码头 But it's not mine, 'cause mine's still in the marina
被严密监视着 under close watch.
另外 我们中午将在学校召开公开会议 Also, we're holding a public meeting at the school at noon,
好让镇民了解案情进展 fill in the town on where we are.
我会解答镇民的疑问 I'll let people ask questions,
但你们都不用去 but none of you needs to be there.
媒体会去吗 Is the press coming?
我们没邀请他们 We haven't asked them.
-为什么不

我只是不懂为什么报道那么少 I just

就连今天的《恩点镇日报》上 Even in the Journal today,
四页的报纸只有六行字的报道 like, six lines on page four.
就像丹尼的死根本不足轻重 It's like Danny doesn't even matter.
我就不会凭小报的报道来判断调查的力度 I wouldn't judge this investigation by what's in the press.
我只是觉得 I think what we're all wondering
增加此事的报道率 is if there were more in the papers,
是否可以唤醒人们的记忆 wouldn't it jog people's memories?
如果把背包客的照片印在...

我们一直在讨论这件事...

我们希望皮尔森再次现身 We want Pierson to reappear.
要是他在报纸上看到自己的照片 If he sees his face in the papers,
他现身的几率会有多大 what are the chances he reveals himself?
媒体方面就交给我们吧 Let us handle the media.
早上好 Morning.
有个女人在我的公寓里 There's a woman in my apartment.
这很少见吗 Is that a rare occurrence?
不如说恩点镇上的选择...

或许她们也是这么看你的 Well, maybe they feel the same way about you.
一定是的 I'm sure they do.
过来一下 Come here for a sec.
怎么了 What is it?
你刚刚找到的吗 Did you just find this?
是的 Yeah.
值得深入调查 Could be worth looking into.
是的 Yeah.
我知道你让索拉诺家的姑娘周末在这打工 I know you've got that Solano girl here most weekends,
但她最近做不了那么多活了 but she can't be much use to you these days.
我一直在给她点时间调整 Well, I've been trying to give her some time.
或者我来干厨房的活 洗碗...

最近生意真的不好做 所以...

你让那个警探住在这里 对吗 You got that detective staying here, don't you?
非常感谢你跑这一趟 I really appreciate you dropping by.
这份简历我会留着 I will keep hold of this,
要是生意好转了 我会找你帮忙的 and maybe I can call you if business picks up.
好的 You do that.
就这些吗 This it?
早上好 Good morning.
你好 How you doing?
我早跟他说过了 都是白费口舌 I've told him.

跟我说说这艘船 Talk to me about the boat.
船被淋过汽油 Well, it was doused in gasoline.
火最终是被海水扑灭的 The seawater eventually put out the fire.
如果有人把船划向离岸那么远的地方 But if they took it out at,
大概凌晨四点时 把船点燃 say, 4:

他们是怎么返回的 how did they get back?
船尾的痕迹表明舷外发动机被拆下来了 Rear section has marks where a motor might've been.
可能是把发动机装在另一艘船上开回来的 Could've used that to get back on another boat.
或者用船拖回来 Or could be they just towed it.
但为什么要把船烧掉 Any hint why they burned it?
看这一片 Take a look at this piece.
已经把样品送去分析了 We sent samples off for analysis.
看这木纹里 Check in the grain.
几缕头发 Strands of hair.
赌一百块这就是他们用过的船 100 bucks says that's the boat they used
那些头发一定是丹尼·索拉诺的 and those hairs belong to Danny Solano.
他们开始慌了 米勒 They're panicking, Miller.
狐狸尾巴终于露出来了 Starting to show themselves.
这正是我们想要看到的 That's exactly what we want.
真是外行 就这样把船烧掉 That's an amateur move, burning it like that.
走吧 米勒 Come on, Miller.
别打扰他工作了 This guy's got work to do.
我刚才在码头 I was just at the pier.
那里有取证车和封锁带 There's a forensics van there, more police tape

昨天晚上有新的证据出现了 New evidence has come in overnight,
我们需要封锁保护现场进行取证 and we have to examine it without disruption.
是昨晚着火的那条小船吗 Was that the boat that was on fire last night?
我哥哥放鱼笼时看到了 My brother saw it when he was out with his traps.
现在谈具体证据还为时尚早 It's too early to talk about specific types of evidence.
搞清楚这个问题的真正答案 Find out the real answer to that question.
照片里的小伙子是谁 Who is the young fellow in the photo,
就是你到处让人看的那个 the one you've been showing around?
一名嫌疑人 A person of interest.
别的信息无可奉告 I'm not prepared to say more than that.
你说了 You said
沙滩上的帐篷会很快拆除的 the tents on the beach'd come down any day.
你这耽误的可是我们的营生啊 This is our livelihood you're stomping on.
请你谅解 哪怕是每一粒沙 You have to understand that every grain of sand
我们都得仔细检查 has to be sifted.
每根头发 每块塑料碎片 Every stray hair, every shard of plastic,
手指甲 脚趾甲 fingernail, toenail,
每片皮肤碎屑都要检验 every piece of skin has to be tested.
沙滩上的犯罪现场 A crime scene on a beach
对我们工作人员来说是最难处理的现场之一 is one of the very toughest for our officers to deal with.
我们会尽可能地不影响你们的生意 We'll do everything we can to minimize the effects on your business.
希望如此 I hope so.
在座的人没有谁会希望恩点镇 No one here wants the name Gracepoint
变成谋杀案的代名词 to become just another word for murder.
告诉过你那里有一艘船了 I told you there was a boat.
你在开玩笑吗 Are you kidding me?
恩点镇一半的人有船 Half of Gracepoint owns a boat.
你去找过吗 Did you look for it?
贝丝·索拉诺知道你没有跟进 Does Beth Solano know that you didn't follow up
我给你的线索吗 on the information that I gave you?
不不不 你没有给我任何线索 No, no, no.

你只是猜测 You took a guess.
别卷进这事来 不然你会后悔的 Do not get involved or you will live to regret it.
回家去 Go home.
-艾莉

能帮我带口信给贝丝和马克吗 Will you pass a message to Beth and Mark?
无论他们什么时候想发声 Whenever they feel able to talk,
来找我们 找我 please come to us, to me.
我们会妥当处理的 We'll do things properly.
我会替你转达的 Uh...

这案子拖得越长 Longer this goes on,
就有越多的人想掺合进来 the more everyone wants to stick their nose in.
-我知道

意见太多 我很不喜欢 Too many opinions.

-卡弗警探

你俩一拍即合 You two have found each other.
真暖心 That warmth the heart.
欧文有发现 我们觉得应该让你们知道 There's something Owen found we think you both need to know about.
又来了 Here we go again.
我们调查了皮艇店的杰克·莱因霍尔德 We did some digging on Jack Reinhold from the kayak shop.
他在这里住了很多年 He's lived here for years,
但没什么人知道他的事 but nobody really knows anything about him.
原来他来这里之前曾经蹲过监狱 Turns out he was in prison before he moved here.
他被定了罪 He was convicted.
与未成年人发生性行为 Sex with a minor.
恩点镇警局
请坐 Take a seat.
谢谢 Thank you.
这是关于那个 Is this about the, uh, backpacker,
跟丹尼说过话的背包客吗 the one who was talking with Danny?
背包客还是没找到 Our backpacker is still MIA.
说说你与未成年人发生性行为的罪行 杰克 Tell us about your conviction for statutory rape, Jack.
穷途末路了 是吗 Getting a bit desperate, are we?
只是想要确认事实 Just trying to establish the facts.
之前谈话的时候你没提到过 You didn't mention it when we spoke.
因为这事跟任何人都没关系 Because it's got nothing to do with anybody,
跟丹尼无关 nothing to do with Danny.
你负责野生动物社团 You run the Wildlife Club.
这得到犯罪记录署查证 That requires a criminal background check
是否有性犯罪记录 cross

但我不是性犯罪者 Yeah, but I'm not a sex offender.
那罪名简直荒唐 我可没有罪案记录 That trial was a farce, and I'm not on any registry.
那是因为你犯事时还没有实施这一套记录程序 Only because it happened before the registry got started.
你应该说出来的 杰克 You should've just declared it, Jack.
什么 艾莉 我刚来镇上的时候 What, Ellie, when I first come to town,
就应该做块小牌子吗 I should've made a little sign?
供参考 "有前科" FYI:

不 不 No.

我来这里就是为了摆脱过去 I was trying to get away from that,
也真的摆脱了 and I did.
二十年来 20 years
相安无事 and no complaints.
我不是你说的那种人 I'm not what you're insinuating.
杰克 你最后一次 Jack, when did you
见到丹尼·索拉诺是什么时候 last see Danny Solano?
发现他尸体的前一天 A full day before his body was found.
早上他过来 He showed up in the morning
照常做记录 and did his log as usual.
丹尼死的那天夜里呢 What about the night of Danny's death?
你在哪 Where were you then?
我一个人在家看书 I was in on my own reading a book.
有人能证明吗 Anyone vouch for that?
只有书 Only the book.
-什么书

你不会爱看的 You might not like it.
没什么图 Hardly any pictures.
听说你喜欢摄影 We hear you like photography.
给社团里的孩子们拍了不少照片吧 You take a lot of pictures of the boys in your group?
我很同情你 I pity you,
把很正常的举动想得如此邪恶 seeing depravity in perfectly normal behavior.
如果你要起诉我 If you have an accusation
或是有证据指证我 or any real evidence,
那就说吧 let's hear it.
不然我还有事要做 Otherwise, I've got work to do.
恩点镇
动作真快 That was quick.
是啊 我手机没带 Yeah, I left my cell.
你已经想办法从卡弗那里 You manage to get an answer
得到了被烧毁小船的答案吗 out of Carver on the combustible boat?
没 还没有 我会去的 No, not yet, but I will.
我以为你在学校是问他这个 I thought you were asking him in the school.
给我一个小时 Just give me one hour.
问题很简单 Simple question.
你有那么忙吗 Are you too busy?
一个小时 我就要一个小时 One hour, that's all I'm asking for.
六十分钟 到时候我会回答你的问题 60 minutes, and then I will answer your query,
而且我想我还有别的消息给你 and I think I might actually have something else for you.
跟丹尼·索拉诺有关吗 Something to do with Danny Solano?
也许吧 Maybe.
据我所知 我是你的编辑 Last I checked, I was your editor.
你不仅仅是我的编辑 You're not just my editor.
还是我的良师 我的偶像 You're my mentor, my idol,
我知识和耐心的源泉 font of knowledge and patience.
我爱你 I love you.
滚出去 Get out of here.
-你先请

没事 Yeah.
准备好了吗 Ready?
无可奉告 No comment.
你有空吗 Hey, have you got a minute?
怎么了 What's up?
苏珊·怀特 她好像住在房车停车场 So Susan Wright, I think she lives over the trailer park.
总闷闷不乐的小个子 有条德国牧羊犬 Short and scowly, german shepherd?
对 就是她 至少我认为是她 Yeah, that's her.

她今天来旅馆 She stopped by the inn this morning
想找个打扫卫生的工作 looking for some cleaning work.
然后呢 Okay.
她提起了克洛伊·索拉诺 She brought up Chloe Solano.
她希望能顶替她的工作 She was hoping to pick up her hours.
我给了她一份申请表 I gave her an application.
我查她的社会安全号码时 When I ran her social security number,
查出来的是另一个名字 a different name came up.
露丝·厄利克 Ruth Erlick.
很奇怪 对吧 Strange, right?
是啊 Yeah.
-谢谢

我冰箱里还有些鹿肉 You know, I got some venison in the freezer.
你应该让我给你们做顿饭 You should let me cook for you guys.
周日午餐什么的 You know, like a Sunday lunch or something.
好了 试一下 All right, try it now.
好了 太棒了 Yep, there it goes.

多谢 老板 All right.

我永远都没法弄好这鬼东西 I can never get this damn thing to work.
这东西这么进到这里的 How'd this get down there?
天啊 Ah, Jeez.
我妈妈 你也知道 My ma, you know?
永远也猜不到她会干什么 You never know.
你是不是故意堵住下水道的 Did you clog the sink on purpose?
我干嘛那么做 No, why

我不知道 你想让我忙起来 I don't know.

就不会胡思乱想了 Take my mind off things?
我给你们做饭吧 Look, why don't you let me cook for you guys, huh?
总要吃东西吧 对吧 You still got to eat, right?
你请我们吃过多少次饭了 How many times have you fed us?
我知道不可能回到过去 不过...

你是个好人 文斯 You're a good man, Vince.
一个好人 A good man.
我很感激你所做的...

你所做的工作 all the work you've been doing,
包括那些额外的工作 and the extra work.
只是 And just...
我一直想给你这个 I've been meaning to give you that.
六十块钱 60 bucks.
我知道这不算多 但是...

听我说 你还是...

你还是先把这个拿回去 Why don't you hold on to it?
等事情过去了 Then when all this is in the past,
我们再好好讨论我升职的问题 we can have a real conversation about that promotion.
周日的事情我去问问贝丝 I'm gonna ask Beth about Sunday.
请进吧 Hey, come on in.
你叫我们来就因为他 This is what you called us back here for?
告诉他们 Tell them.
丹尼希望大家知道 他认识凶手 Danny wants to tell people that he was killed by someone he knew.
太过分了 All right, this is offensive.
这次会面到此为止 I'm ending this right now.
不 雷蒙德知道船的事情 No, Raymond knew about the boat.
他说他告诉过你们 He says that he told you.
-你不听

就听他说完 拜托了 Just hear him out, please.
告诉她 Go ahead.
贝丝 我们调查了康奈利先生的背景 Beth, we checked into Mr.

他已经两次申请破产 He's declared bankruptcy twice.
不 不 等等 No, no.

他有盗窃 He has prior convictions for theft
和预谋诈骗的前科 and conspiracy to commit fraud.
-什么

出去 快走 Out, now.
我的前科...

我的前科跟这事没关系 That has got nothing to do with this!
你还让他进来 真是太傻了 You're a moron for letting him in.
站起来 Get up.
我不知道你是精神不正常 还是爱说谎 I don't know if you're mentally ill, a liar,
或以为自己满口真理 Or someone who actually believes they're telling the truth.
我不关心 I don't care.
我的工作是抓到凶手 并在庭上指认他 My job is to find this killer and prove my case in court.
放开我 Let go of me.
我基于事实 I deal in facts.
但你对她说的都是幻象 All you've given her is fantasy.
现在 皮特会开车跟着你 Now, Pete is gonna follow you as you drive
直到你离这间房子远远的 very far away from this house.
最后一次警告你 Final warning.
再看见你 I see you again...
我一定把你送进监狱 I will lock you up.
他为什么要那么做 艾莉 Why would he do this, Ellie?
他想要得到什么好处 What does he have to gain?
我又没给他钱 I haven't paid him anything.
我知道 但两周后 两周后 I know, but two weeks from now

他就会去找媒体 给他们内幕消息 he goes to the press, and he gives them an exclusive.
他将在半年内出传记 Six months from now, he writes his memoir.
名曰《恩点镇谋杀案破案记》 "How I Worked to Solve the Gracepoint Child Murder Case."
我孤立无援了 I am so alone in this.
你和马克谈了吗 Have you talked to Mark yet?
不 没有 我做不到 No.

贝丝...

你必须得谈 You have to.
你确定你家人同意吗 You sure your family's okay with it?
你问过你妈妈了吗 Have you checked with your mom?
好 一会儿见 Okay, good.

开饭了 Sustenance.
-谢谢

我饿了可不是什么好事 Me hungry isn't good.
我向你保证 I promise you.
听我说 我在想 So listen, I was thinking
在我们写报道之前 我们应该先和 we should probably talk to Jack Reinhold,
杰克·莱因霍尔德谈一谈 听听他的说法 get his side of the story before we write anything.
越快越好 Mm

我们吃完午饭 然后你去和他谈 Let's finish lunch, and you'll go talk to him.
我一个人吗 You mean like alone?
你看到他是怎么对我的了 You saw the way he treated me.
就好像我是个害虫 I'm like vermin to him.
这任务交给你了 This one's on you.
不过我认识这家伙 I

我和他一起观察野生动物 I mean, I did wildlife observation with him
一直到六年级 till I was in, like, sixth grade.
所以他才会和你谈 Exactly why he'll talk to you.
反正我还有别的事 I have something to do anyways.
要告诉我是什么事吗 You gonna tell me what?
我们上了一次床 你就开始监视我吗 We sleep together once.

快点吃完去干活 Eat and get on it.
恩点镇日报社
社会安全号码 925

感谢你们接受我的采访 Thank you for speaking to me.
我不是来给你们压力的 I'm not here to pressure you.
实际上 案发第一天我就来镇上了 In fact, I've been in town since day one,
但我没来打搅你们 and I've left you alone.
没错 Yeah, it's true.
我把丹尼的玩具留在了海滩上 I left one of Danny's toys at the beach,
是她还给我的 才没有被人偷走 and she brought it back to me so it wouldn't get stolen.
简单地说 我认为丹尼的案子 Look, very simply, I think Danny's case
应该得到更多报道 should be getting more coverage.
你来就是为了报道吗 And you're here to help with that?
我要说的话你们可能不爱听 Well, you're not gonna like hearing this,
但你们儿子被杀这件案子 but part of the reason your son's death
得不到应有的社会关注度的原因之一 isn't getting the attention it deserves is,
是因为他没有合适定位 he's not the right profile.
如果丹尼是女孩 You know, if Danny were a girl,
金发 再小几岁 blonde, few years younger,
记者们会蜂拥而来挤爆这个小镇 this town would be crawling with reporters.
我希望你是在说笑 I hope you're kidding.
抱歉但事实如此 I'm sorry I'm not.
12岁男孩 有时候 12

人们已经不把他们当孩子看待了 don't really see them as kids anymore, you know?
他们可能会破坏公物 沾染偷窃 They can get into vandalism, steal things;
要是你想让这个案子获得更多的关注 if you want more focus on this case,
贝丝 这其实完全取决于你 Beth, it's really gonna come down to you.
我 为什么 Me?

你以你的立场来讲诉这件事 You tell your side of things,
你儿子真实的形象 who your son really was,
你们的母子深情 how it's been for you,
你会得到全国的母亲的响应 every mom in the state will respond.
我不知道 我们应该先取得警方同意吧 I don't know.

当然可以 You can, absolutely.
但你得知道 他们十分谨慎 But I will say they're being very cautious,
尤其是卡弗警探 Detective Carver in particular.
他禁止局里的任何人接触媒体 He won't let anyone in the department speak to the press.
保罗·科茨还不是一样有办法搞到消息 That doesn't stop Paul Coates.
好吧 如果 Okay, well, what if
在她上交稿件前先拿给我们看呢 she shows us what she writes before she sends it in?
我一般不这么做 不过...

这次可以破例 只要你们愿意提供 maybe this time, if you'd consider giving me
一张你和丹尼的合照作为报道插图 a picture of you and Danny for the article.
你觉得呢 What do you think?
我们之后回复你吧 Why don't we just get back to you,
明天或者...

就这么办吧 Let's do it.
我们为什么要来询问牧师 What are we asking the priest?
他是丹尼被杀当晚 He's one of the few without an alibi
少数几个没有不在场证明的人之一 the night Danny was killed.
和他熟吗 Know him well?
一般 A bit.
他在这儿长大 He grew up here,
不过比我小很多 but he's a lot younger than me.
这时候你应该说 That's where you're supposed to say,
"他看起来可没你年轻啊 米勒" "But he doesn't look it, Miller."
没听出来 Ah, missed my cue.
总之 他高中毕业后就离开镇子了 Anyway, he left right after high school.
才回来了两三年 He's been back two, three years.
汤姆参加着他的主日学校 Tom goes to his sunday school.
丹尼也是 So did Danny.
艾莉 Ellie.
贝丝一家从来不错过礼拜的 Beth's family's been coming here forever.
玛丽还是董事会成员呢 You know, Mary is on our board.
你每周至少会见丹尼一次 And you saw Danny at least once a week,
对他相当熟悉了 knew him really well.
非常了解不敢说 Well, I wouldn't say really well.
他是个好孩子 和汤姆一样 I mean, he was a good kid, same as Tom.
牧师会来主日学校上课吗 Does the priest normally teach sunday school?
我以为只有没转正的牧师会去上课 I thought that happened during services.
是我后来安排的 I've arranged to have it afterwards.
如果我能让孩子们 You know, if I can personally convey
也感受到 哪怕只有一点 just a bit of the comfort and joy
信仰给我带来的这种慰藉与欣喜 my faith brings me to the kids in the community,
我觉得整个恩点镇都将获益匪浅 then I think all of Gracepoint benefits.
丹尼死亡当晚你在哪 Where were you on the night of Danny's death?
像我跟警员说的那样 我一个人在教区 Like I told your officers, in the rectory on my own.
熬夜写一则布道 I was up late trying to write a sermon.
"努力" 就是那则布道的关键词 "Trying" being the operative word.
你经常熬夜吗 Did you often stay up late?
前几天晚上凌晨四点的时候 Because I was down on the corner
我走到那个街角 at 4:

看到你就站在那扇门外 and I saw you right outside the door there.
那是你啊 Oh, was that you?
好吧 Okay, um...
没错 我患有严重的失眠症 Yeah, I have terrible insomnia
这些年时不时会发作 off and on for years.
我找不到治愈办法 I can't find anything to cure it,
所以就起床 到处逛逛 so I get up, wander around.
这次失眠发作有什么特殊诱因吗 Anything specific that triggered it this time?
没有 Not really, no.
那个周四晚上你也出去闲逛了吗 Were you up wandering on that thursday night?
应该没有 I don't

可能有时候我会出去透透气 I mean, I could've gone outside for some fresh air
但我不记得了 at some point, but I don't remember.
是苏珊吧 Susan, yes?
经验丰富的家政保洁工求职
你要说 我不能把海报贴在这吗 You gonna tell me I can't put this here?
这是个公共广告亭 It's a public kiosk.
请便 我只是想和你打个招呼 Oh, go ahead.

我是凯西 日报的编辑 I'm Kathy.

你确定名字没有写错吗 You sure you have the right name on there?
是苏珊还是露丝 Is it Susan or Ruth?
我无意间发现了一些关于你的文章 Came across something written about you
几年前的东西 用的却是另一个名字 from several years back under a different name.
一定是谁写错了 Somebody must have written it wrong.
我很好奇为什么会写错 Wonder why that would happen.
我不知道你想从我这里问什么 I don't know what you want with me.
我还有活要干呢 I got business to conduct.
好吧 或许下次我们能有机会聊聊 All right.

回见 I'll see you around.
你曾是田径运动员 不会吧 You ran track, really?
是的 现在看起来难以置信吧 Yeah, tough to believe now, huh?
