你怎么回事 What is your problem?
如果你再打给我...

我得挂了 I got to go.
非常抱歉 I'm so sorry.
凶杀案 Ah, homicide.
没有途径90多米的 What morning's complete
垃圾堆去看尸体 算什么圆满的早晨 without a 100

你接的电话 You picked up.
我接电话时 When I pick up,
犯罪现场是喷泉或博物馆 不错的地方 the crime scene is a fountain or a museum, someplace nice.
你接电话 就是鸟不拉屎的窝或隧道 You pick up, it's a crack den or a tunnel.
几个意思 我有不良环境犯罪现场的诅咒吗 What?

我只是说说 I'm just saying.
没有钱包 没有身份证 No purse, no I.

不过某人喜欢拍照 Someone liked to take pictures, though.
你认为她是鸡吗 What do you think?

她不是第一个被弃尸在这里的妓女 Well, it wouldn't be the first prostitute to end up here.
喂 可疑凶器 H

那是什么玩意儿 What is that thing?
奶酪火锅叉子 Fondue skewer.
搞什么鬼 What the hell?
她的发型 裙子 Her hair, her dress

像是准备参加七十年代化妆舞会 it's like she's ready for a '70s costume party.
可能是电影的临时演员 Could be an extra in a movie.
也许他们在重制《周末夜狂热》 Maybe they're finally remaking "Saturday night fever."
我告诉过你那是我看的第一部限制级电影吗 Did I ever tell you that was my first r

想起来了 这宗案子我需要亨利帮忙 It's come up.

他们常说我的头发和特拉沃尔塔很像 They used to say my hair and Travolta's was identical

厚实 乌黑 透着完美光泽 thick, jet

这个也告诉过你吗 Tell you about this, too?
已经想起来了 It has come up.
抱歉 Sorry.
亚伯古董行
我的天哪 亚伯拉罕 什么味道 Oh, goodness gracious, Abraham, what's that?
先生 是湿纸箱和霉菌的味道 That, sir, is the aroma of, uh, wet cardboard and mold.
昨晚太冷了 阁楼有一根水管爆裂了 It was so cold last night, one of the pipes burst in the attic.
幸运的是 只有这个箱子被浸湿了 Fortunately, this is the only box that got soaked.
但愿你的棒球卡不在里面 Not your baseball cards, I hope.
没有 我把它们放在保险箱里了 No, those I have in a safety

这都是些旧杂物 This is just some old junk.
小亚伯拉罕的铜色婴儿袜 Baby Abraham's bronzed booties.
是的 别乘机提起往事 Yeah.

只是让人徒增伤感的杂物 It's just sentimental garbage, you know,
没有任何实际价值 without any real value.
这是你过去的一部分 Well, it's part of your past.
我想保存的 我都保存在这里了 Yeah, well, what I want to keep, I keep up here.
否则 我就忘了它 给新记忆腾出空间 If not, I just forget it, make room for the new.
又一件属于垃圾填埋地的东西 The other stuff belongs in a landfill.
妈妈的烹饪书 Mom's cookbook.
阿比盖尔·摩根
我没看见它 I, uh, didn't see that.
抱歉 Um...

这不是垃圾 That was not junk.
也许你说得对 亚伯拉罕 Perhaps you're right, Abraham.
新的一天 It's a new day.
有新的记忆等着我们 There are new memories to be made.
我去上班了 I'm off.
人们常说忽略过去的人 We are told that those who ignore the past
注定会重蹈覆辙 are doomed to repeat it,
而沉浸在过去的人 while those who dwell in the past
则只爱重蹈覆辙 would love nothing more than to repeat it
一遍又一遍 over and over again.
但记忆就像照片 会随着时间褪色 But memories, like photographs, have a way of fading with time.
根据出血量判断 Well, based on the amount of blood,
她被这支凶器刺穿颈部大量失血致死 we figure she bled out from her neck wound, made by this.
我喜欢奶酪火锅 Oh, I love fondue!
可以跟干酪一起作为开胃菜 You can go, like, savory with cheese
跟巧克力一起甜滋滋 or sweet with chocolate,
最重要的是大家一起吃 but the best part

所以它是传染病的培养皿 And, therefore, a Petri dish for communicable diseases.
我拿这个去化验 I'll get this tested.
医生 她的手腕有瘀青 So, doc, bruises on her wrists
她可能被禁锢过 suggest she might have been held down.
太神奇了 That's amazing.
什么神奇 What's amazing?
她的头发 Her hair.
闻起来...

有垃圾味吗 Garbage?
含氯氟烃 Chlorofluorocarbons,
在七十年代用于像发胶那样的喷雾剂产品 used in aerosol products like hair spray in the '70s,
之后被禁用 before it was banned.
我在想...

我们认为她穿着旧时代的服装 Yeah, we were thinking the vintage outfit she's wearing
可能表明她是穿着戏装的演员 might point to an actor in costume.
没有戏装能做到如此准确 Well, no costume is this exact, no.
被害人的指甲油含有酞酸酯 Our victim's nail polish contains phthalate ester,
一种塑化剂 a plasticizer,
因为含致癌物质被禁用 discontinued due to its carcinogenic properties.
不合时宜的远不止于此 The anachronisms don't stop there.
外衣是冯芙丝汀宝的原货 This wrap is a Von Furstenberg original.
每件物品都是那个时代的产物 Every item is vintage.
你在说什么 医生 难道她穿越了吗 What are we talking about here, doc

或者被害人对过去痴迷 Or a victim who was obsessed with the past,
说到痴迷 and speaking of obsessions,
鉴于这些照片展现窥阴本质 due to the voyeuristic nature of these photographs,
我推断被害人是某人的幻想对象 I'd wager that our victim was the object of someone's fantasy.
结果发展成一场恶梦 Which turned into a nightmare.
被害人颈动脉被割穿 失血过量致死 The victim bled out when her carotid was cut.
我们找到的奶酪火锅叉子跟伤口吻合 And the fondue skewer we recovered matches the wound.
你以为你已经掌握全局 Just when you think you've heard it all.
调查她的卖淫过去了吗 Have we run her past vice?
调查了 但不能确定她是不是妓女 Yeah, but we're not sure she's a prostitute.
根据她的装束 Based on her wardrobe,
亨利认为她沉浸于七十年代的奇怪幻想中 Henry thinks she was part of some weird '70s fantasy.
也许我们楼下的验尸房放着的是 Well, who knew we had Anna Wintour downstairs
安娜·温图尔(时尚界人物)呢 doing our autopsies?
失踪人士档案中 Missing persons came back with reports
有跟我们的无名女死者符合的描述 matching our Jane Doe's description.
名字叫莎拉·克兰西 We got a match

纽约大学大三学生 室友报的失踪 junior at N.

不敢相信她们是同一个人 It's hard to believe it's the same girl.
乔 去跟室友聊聊 Jo, talk to the roommate.
汉森 回去垃圾填埋地 Hanson, go back to the landfill.
看能不能从弃尸处 See if you can trace back from the dump site
找回被害人被杀的凶案现场 to find out where our victim was murdered.
瞧你接电话的后果 See what happens when you pick up the phone?
我们在报到日认识的 We met our first day.
我们都来自小镇 We were both from small towns,
第一次进城 in the city for the first time.
能成为室友 是因为我跟莎拉的合拍程度 The fact that we ended up as roommates, it was perfect...
就像已经做了一辈子的朋友一样 like Sarah and I had been friends our whole lives.
最近在莎拉身上有发生什么事吗 Had Sarah been dealing with any personal issues?
比如跟新男友不愉快地分手了 New boyfriend, bad breakup maybe?
我不知道 I don't know.
我以为你们是最好的朋友 I thought you were best friends.
以前我们很亲密 之后就不亲了 We were v

莎拉刚到纽约时是个小镇的姑娘 Sarah may have arrived in New York a small

但她变了 不是吗 but she was changing, wasn't she?
相当精致的服装 Rather a sophisticated wardrobe.
不像是出自当代设计师之手 对吧 Not exactly contemporary couture, is it?
詹妮弗 你无需对我们隐瞒 Jennifer, you can talk to us.
我们只想找出杀害她的凶手 We just want to find the person who did this.
她变了 She had changed.
不止是外表 And not just the way that she looked.
你知道是谁还是什么 Do you have any idea who or what
造成这样的转变呢 would be responsible for this transformation?
她变得很神秘 She had become so secretive.
她缺席所有的课 除了一门课 Dropped all of her classes, except for one.
她似乎对那门课很痴迷 It was like she was obsessed with it.
哪门课 Which class?
是什么创造了这些幻想 What urge creates these fantasies?
是控制 Is it control,
权力 转化吗 power, transformation?
如果我们的幻想是我们最深切的欲望 If our fantasies are fed by our deepest desires...
是我的问题 还是大学已经不一样了 Is it just me, or has college changed?
理解他们能告诉我们真实的自己...

自弗洛伊德以来 心理学就开始侧重于性 Since Freud, psychology has become obsessed with sexuality.
-开灯

刺激 stimulating.
我们都有幻想的对象或者事物 We all have someone or something we fantasize about.
问题是如果我们屈服于这些欲望 The question is, what could we learn about ourselves
我们能对自己有何了解 if we gave in to that desire?
今天的课就上到这里 谢谢 That's all I have for today.

伊奥娜 Iona.
课堂上要称我为道斯教授 Oh, that's Professor Dawes in the classroom.
你可以叫我莫莉 You can call me Molly.
很高兴又见到你 莫莉 Well, it's a pleasure to see you again, Molly.
你可以叫我亨利 You may call me Henry.
你真是充满惊喜 You are full of surprises.
治疗师 施虐者 Therapist, dominatrix,
教授 professor?
我有耶鲁大学心理学博士学位 Well, I do have a PHD in psychology from Yale,
所以系主任在某些不是她手底下的老师 so the head of the department calls me in
擅长的课题时 any time there's subject matter
会打电话叫我来 her staff isn't as well

比如说性幻想 Such as sexual fantasy.
这也正是我们要来跟你讨论的话题 Which is exactly what we've come here to discuss.
当然是以专业的角度来探讨 Professionally, of course.
我不敢相信她死了 I can't believe she's dead.
你跟莎拉很熟吗 Did you know Sarah well?
我们有很多相似点 We had a lot in common.
我们俩都有被人收养的童年 She and I both had very sheltered childhoods.
她跟我其他的学生不同 She was different from the rest of my students.
她很成熟 She was very mature.
她常聊自己的私人生活吗 Did she talk a lot about her personal life?
我们想找出...

是谁拍的照片 who took these.
她几周前在我上班时间来找过我 She did come to office hours a few weeks ago

无关课业 Not about class.
她告诉我她现在在谈 She told me that she was involved
一段角色扮演的恋爱 in a role

她知道这本质上来说很不寻常 and she knew it wasn't normal, per se.
她知道你的...

另一份工作吗 secondary occupation?
作为施虐治疗师吗 That I'm a domination therapist?
这就是为什么我觉得 That's why I felt obliged
有义务问她是否享受 是否感到安全 to ask her if she enjoyed it and if she felt safe,
她回答说是的 and she said yes.
但是...

如果她是错的 而我没有...

这不是你的错 It's not your fault.
也许我有办法能帮你们 Perhaps there's a way I can help.
如果你们能 I mean, if there's anything
告诉我犯罪现场的情况 那...

多谢 教授 Thank you, professor,
但是纽约最好的人员正在调查中 but we have New York city's finest on it.
谢谢 Thank you.
你确定他们只给了我们一套防护服 You sure they only gave us one hazmat suit?
什么 我想是因为经费紧张 What?

美著名男演员 代表作《教父》
我觉得我找到什么了 I think I found something

一个犯罪现场的可能位置 A possible location for the crime scene.
我在尸体位置的附近 I did a reagent search
对所有废弃物做了反应物试验 on all the debris near where the victim's body was found
发现在这堆垃圾邮件上有血迹 and picked up traces of blood on this junk mail.
这些都来自同一栋公寓楼 All from the same apartment building.
我想也许那就是她被杀的地点 Thinking that's where she was killed
然后她的尸体和这些垃圾都被丢弃在这 and then dumped the body here with the rest of the garbage?
我们有地址了 庆祝下 We got an address.

你需要洗个澡 You need a shower.
我打电话给乔 I'm calling Joe.
我很快就需要我自己的警徽了 I'm gonna need my own badge soon.
对 想多了 卢卡斯 Yeah, aim high, Lucas.
拜托 就荣誉警徽之类的 Come on, an honorary badge, something.
莎拉是个好房客 Sarah was a real good tenant.
总是准时交房租 很安静 Huh, yeah, always paid on time, quiet.
她有男朋友吗 或者有个老年绅士 Was there a boyfriend, an older gentleman perhaps?
没有 No.
你们有监控录像吗 Do you have surveillance?
这是栋老公寓 This is an older building.
刚建成的时候 是当时最好的 Well, when it was built, it was state

你应该见过 You should've seen it.
就好像...

搞什么 What the hell?
谢谢 Thank you.
这个衣橱里一件衣服都没有 There is not one article of clothing in this closet.
一台工艺为SL

40年的历史了 40 years old.
就好像这刚从盒子里拿出来 Like it just came out of the box.
我们有台一模一样的 We had the exact same one.
在店里 In the shop.
看看这些杂志 Check out these magazines.
都出版于同一年同一月份 They're all from the same year and the same month.
这个奶酪火锅装置也是原版的 This fondue set is original, too.
这地方的每个物品都经过精心挑选 Every item in this place has been carefully chosen
以营造一种70年代末的完美相似感 to create a perfect simulacrum of the late 1970s.
每样东西都是按照这个设计来摆设的 Everything is in accord with that design.
除了这个 Everything except for this.
小地毯 The little rug?
这是个流苏编制的壁挂 It's a macrame wall hanging

在当时非常流行 very popular at the time
而且从不会被放在地板上 and never ever placed on the floor.
不会 那样就太奇怪了 No, that would be insane.
我相信我们找到犯罪现场了 I believe we've found our crime scene.
但是如果这个受害者是慢慢流血而亡 But if the victim bled out slowly,
为什么血集中在这块 why would the blood be concentrated here?
她为什么不站起来寻找帮助 Why didn't she get up, go for help?
难道她那会被弄晕了 You think she was knocked out?
也许是凶手制住了她 看着她死的 Perhaps the killer held her down and watched her die.
来看看这个 Look at this.
另一张宝丽莱相片 Another polaroid.
这张看上去不一样 This one looks different.
宝丽莱照片会褪色 Polaroids fade.
而从这张照片的褪色程度来看 And judging by the deterioration of this image,
这张真的是在70年代拍摄的 I'd say this one was actually taken in the '70s.
这不是同一个女孩 This isn't the same girl,
但他们穿的是一样的衣服 but they're both wearing the same dress.
那这个女人是谁 So, who is this woman?
莎拉要假扮的女人 The woman Sarah was supposed to be.
这公寓是70年代房子非常好的翻版 The apartment was a perfect replica of a 1970s home,
连细节都很到位 exact in every detail.
什么意思 比如说 迪斯科 What do you mean, like, disco,
涤纶 尼克松 uh, polyester, Nixon?
1969

不是20世纪最好的年代 但是...

伊奥娜 莫莉 相信这是 Iona

类似角色扮演幻想的一部分 some sort of role

伊奥娜 Iona.
那个施虐治疗师 As in your dominatrix gal pal?
教授 Eh, professor.
她在纽约大学教心理学课程 She teaches a psychology class at N.

我懂了 Oh, now I get it.
新围巾 New scarf.
你这么穿是为了给她留下好印象 亨利 You're dressed to impress, Henry.
我承认莫莉是个 Look, I'll grant you
很有魅力的女人 that, uh, Molly is a fascinating woman,
但我对她的兴趣仅限于专业问题 but my interest in her is strictly professional.
我听说她很严 I hear she's very strict.
我知道我知道 我懂我懂 No, I know.

你害怕了 已经过了很久了 You're scared.

你已经手生了 and you're out of practice.
我又不是和尚 I'm not a monk.

我知道 No, no, I know.
你跟无数个美丽的女人上过床 You've had sex, yeah, with countless beautiful women.
你拥有永恒的魅力 Oh, you've got that immortal charm going for you, I know,
但是你跟她们都没有结果 亨利 but none of them have ever gone anywhere, Henry.
我说你还记得 I mean, do you even remember

我们是一对引人注目的夫妇 We're a distinguished couple
出来享受一顿高级的晚餐 out for a sophisticated dinner
再跳点不那么高级的小舞 and a spot of unsophisticated dancing,
拜我有两只左脚所赐 courtesy of my two left feet.
你是位很棒的舞者 But you're a marvelous dancer.
人人都会盯着我们瞧的 Everyone will stare at us.
我们一起经历了战争的风雨 We've braved a war together,
一起养育了一个孩子 raised a child together.
我确信我们 I'm sure we can
也可以一起从纽约的一晚中生存下来的 survive a night out in New York together.
来吧 会很有趣的 Come on.

你说得对 You're right.
我们去找点乐子吧 Let's have fun.
我有个想法 I had a thought.
新围巾 New scarf?
没错 Yes.
我一般不对我们如何查案 Now, I don't usually have a say
发表意见 in how we manage an investigation,
但是我有个想法 but I had a thought.
你说过了 You mentioned this thought.
我们能不能请道斯教授 What if we were to involve Professor Dawes
作为心理侧写师 as a psychological profiler
专注于对性幻想的分析 with an eye toward sexual fantasies?
谢谢你 亨利 Thank you, Henry,
但我觉得不用莫莉我们也搞定了 but I think we have it covered without Molly.
乔 有发现了 Jo!

鉴证人员从莎拉的笔记本电脑里提取了视频 Forensics pulled video from Sarah's laptop.
你一定累坏了 亲爱的 You must be exhausted, dear.
把外套脱了吧 Take off your jacket.
如今在59街和列克星的地铁建设真是太讨厌了 Subway construction was just awful today at 59th and Lex.
我得走两个街区才能回家 I had to walk two blocks to get home.
可怜的宝贝儿 Poor baby.
你看上去精神紧张 You look tense.
我知道这个能让你放松下来 I know just the thing to calm you down.
抱歉 Sorry.
我室友回来了 My roommate's home.
我不是什么好演员 I'm not much of an actress,
但我对你的建议很感兴趣 But I'm interested in your offer.
希望我们能一起玩 I hope we can play together.
她看起来像是在试镜 Almost like she's auditioning.
什么样的杀手会发试镜广告 What kind of killer puts out a casting call?
也许一位专家的真知灼见会有所帮助 Perhaps the insights of an expert would be helpful.
好吧 亨利 Okay, Henry,
我们去和你的女朋友谈谈吧 let's go talk to your girlfriend.
请吧 博士 说说吧 Oh, please, Doctor, do go on.
大部分幻想都是异想天开 Well, most fantasies are flights of fancy.
它们是 They're scenarios
幻想者平日里遇不到的场景 that the participants can't live out in their normal lives.
但这个可算得上是普通至极了 But this one couldn't be more ordinary.
没错 所以...

炮制了这出戏的男人 他的幻想在于控制 The man who concocted it, his fantasy is about control.
他打扮她 让她住在这个公寓...

并且告诉她要说些什么 and tells her what to say.
有些男人就是追求这个 控制女人 Some men seek that out, to dominate a woman.
其他人则想要被控制 Others look to be dominated.
简单说来 At its simplest,
这只不过是谁想在上面的问题 it's really just about who wants to be on top.
新围巾 New scarf?
新香水 New fragrance?
道斯教授 Professor Dawes?
在这个视频中你还看出来什么了吗 You see anything else in the video?
这个幻想和控制无关 This fantasy isn't about domination,
而是关乎于再造 It's about re

一份记忆 A memory.
他过去的某个时刻 A moment from his past.
他上一次感到幸福的时刻 The last time he was happy,
沐浴爱河的时刻 之类的 in love, something,
你们要找的是一个65岁左右的男子 But you're looking for a man in his mid 60s,
也许...

反正是某个在工作中和生活中 but somebody who employs exacting control
严格控制他人的人 in their work and their life.
如今在59街和列克星的地铁建设真是太讨厌了 Subway construction was just awful today at 59th and Lex.
我得走两个街区才能回家 I had to walk two blocks to get home.
假如这个幻想 If this fantasy
是关于我们的凶手过去的某一时刻 is about a moment from our killer's past,
那么所有这些细节都是有意义的 Then all of these details are meaningful.
等等 Wait.
1979年时在59街和列克星敦 There was a massive subway construction
有大规模的地铁建设 at 59th and Lexington in 1979,
就在犯罪现场之外的几个街区 blocks away from the crime scene,
那么问题来了 which begs the question...
1979年时谁租了那间公寓 Who rented that apartment in 1979?
您能确定1979年时 Can you confirm that you leased an apartment
你租用了东61街112号的一间公寓吗 at, um, 112 east 61st street in 1979?
我不记得了 I don't remember.
租赁合同上将你列为了 The lease has you listed
1978年至1982年的租户 as tenant from 1978 to 1982.
那是很久以前的事了 That's a long time ago,
但听起来是那么回事 but it sounds right.
那不是用来看景的 That is not for sightseeing.
所以 这是怎么回事 So, what is this about?
一名女子在你的老公寓里被杀了 A woman was murdered in your old apartment.
她叫莎拉·克兰西 Her name was Sarah Clancy.
也许你记得在哪里见过她 Maybe you remember seeing her somewhere?
那这个女人呢 How about this woman?
谢谢您费时 内维尔先生 Thank you for your time, Mr.

等等 别 不要 Hey, wait.

停下 Stop.
你会毁了那张照片的 You're gonna destroy that.
它很脆弱的 It's very delicate.
求你了 Please.
把照片给我 Give me the picture.
她是谁 Who was she?
我的妻子...

她是什么时候过世的 When did she die?
1981年 乳腺癌 1981, breast cancer.
你刚刚毁了的那张照片 The picture you just destroyed
是我在她确诊前几周拍的 I took a few weeks before she was diagnosed.
前天晚上你在哪里 内维尔先生 Where were you two nights ago, Mr.

我在那里 I was there.
和莎拉一起在公寓里吗 With Sarah in the apartment?
莎拉出什么事了 内维尔先生 What happened to Sarah, Mr.

我想我杀了她 I think I killed her.
您能告诉我们想您这样的一位男士 Can you tell us how a man like you
怎么会认识一位20岁的大学生 came to meet a 20

莎拉·克兰西呢 Sarah Clancy?
我当时去市中心进行一次房屋检查 I was downtown for a building inspection,
然后我看见了她 and I saw her.
起初 我觉得她一定是...

你妻子 Your wife?
真的好像 So much alike,
我第一眼看见她就觉得昨日重现 the pieces fell into place as soon as I saw her.
我可以租下那间公寓 重新装修 I could rent the apartment, remodel.
我希望尽可能的真实 I wanted it to be as real as possible.
好吧 你强迫莎拉做了什么 Okay, what'd you make Sarah do,
除了让她模仿你的亡妻以外 other than impersonate your dead wife?
我没有强迫她做任何事 I didn't make her do anything.
我雇了她 她是拿了工钱的 I hired her, and she was compensated.
我确信这一切原本都是很浪漫的 Oh, I'm sure it was all very romantic
直到她最终死了 till she ended up dead.
好了 凶案发生的那一晚 Okay, night of the murder

告诉我们发生什么事了 tell us what happened.
和往常一样 我回到公寓 The same thing as always

他当天重现的不是随便哪一晚 It wasn't some random night he was re

而是那一晚 It was the night.
他人生中最美好的时刻 The best moment in his life.
那莎拉做了什么 And what did Sarah do?
她告诉我她刚刚发现自己怀孕了...

我怀孕了 I'm pregnant.
就像我亡妻当时告诉我那样 just the way my late wife told me.
我处于狂喜之中 And in my excitement,
我给她拍了一张照 I take her picture
因为我想在剩下的日子里永远铭记那一刻 because I want to remember that moment for the rest of my life.
但是每一次...

那一刻都像是在记忆的长河中越滑越远 the moment seemed to slip farther and farther into the past.
不知怎么的变得越来越模糊 it felt fainter somehow.
那就是你杀了她的原因吗 Is that why you killed her?
就因为幻想不够真实吗 The fantasy wasn't realistic enough?
她当时在用手机 但是...

我不允许莎拉日常生活中所有东西的出现 I forbade any items from Sarah's regular life,
所以她当时的行为让我心烦意乱 and that threw me off.
让你愤怒 Made you angry.
她毁了你的幻想 She ruined your fantasy.
所以你刺伤她了是吗 So, you stabbed her, didn't you?
我想是吧 I think so.

用什么刺伤她的 With what?
奶酪火锅用的烤肉叉子 The skewer from the fondue set.
给我们示范一遍 Show us how you did it.
在脖子上刺了一次 In the neck once...
就像这样 like that.
干得好 警官 Nice work, detective.
谋杀供认总是无懈可击的 You can't beat a murder confession.
除非他招供的是事实 If only it were true.
亨利 他承认人是他杀的 Henry, he said he did it.
凶器从下方进入莎拉的脖子 The murder weapon entered Sarah's neck from beneath,
但从内维尔的刺入动作来看 yet based on Neville's pantomime,
进入的角度是向下的 the angle of entry was downward.
他在79年租下了那间公寓 We have the man who owned the apartment in '79,
并且制造一些幼稚的幻想 who created some whack

然后把一名年轻的女学生扔进垃圾运送槽 and then dumped a young co

如果你是在找借口 Listen, if

想多见莫莉几次 to spend more time with Molly,
你只要约她出去就行了 all you got to do is ask her out.
你和阿比盖尔分开多久了 How long has it been since you and Abigail split up?
有一段时间了 It's been a while.
也许是时候走出悲伤了 Well, maybe it's time you get yourself back out there.
这案子完结了 你也戴上了新围巾 We have a closed case, and you have a new scarf.
还能有什么更坏的事发生呢 What's the worst that can happen, huh?
我都说了这不是什么好主意 Oh, I told you this was a terrible idea!
女服务员以为你体贴入微 The hostess thought you were so sweet
带你的母亲去参加晚宴 to take your mother out to dinner.
当你挽着我的手时 你有没有看到 And did you see the way everyone looked at us
那些人看我们的眼光 when you took my hand?
没人在看我们 No one was looking.
亨利 你是真的看不到吗 Henry, you really are blind, aren't you?
是的 Yes.
自从见到你之后 Since the moment I first saw you.
亨利 看看我们俩 Henry, look at us.
我们俩太可笑了 We're ridiculous.
可笑的爱情故事 A ridiculous love story.
所以这让我们俩很特别 That what makes us so special.
我想要相信你 Look, I want to believe you,
可我每次看着你 but every time I look at you

那就别看 Then don't.
闭上眼睛 Close your eyes.
想象一下我们在哪 And where do you imagine us?

格伦·米勒在演奏 Glenn Miller is playing.
我们今晚就在那 Then that's where we are tonight.
你在想那件案子是吧 You're thinking about the case, aren't you?
那件案子 是的 抱歉 The case, yes.

不不 没关系 No, no, it's okay.
我也一直在想莎拉 I can't stop thinking about Sarah, either.
我的拍档马丁内兹警探让我承诺 Detective Martinez, my partner, made me promise
在我们约会时不谈任何谋杀案 that I wouldn't talk about any murders on our date.
所以你才闭口不提吗 Oh, is that what this is?
是的 Yes.
我对最新的这些礼仪不熟悉 I'm not up on all of the latest rituals...
但是请注意 最近有人在追求你 but be aware, you're currently being courted.
注意到了 Duly noted.
为了命运让我们回到一起 正义也得以伸张 Here's to fate bringing us back together
我们干一杯吧 and justice served.
我不确定那就是案子的真相 I'm not quite sure that's the case.
什么意思 凶手不是认罪了吗 What do you mean?

是的 可是 We do, but...
亨利 等等 Henry, stop.
你可以在约会的时候谈论凶案 没关系的 You can talk murder on our date.

他回忆的往事里有些事不太对劲 There's something off about his recollection of events.
有没有可能他有心理上的崩溃 Is it possible that he had a psychological break
令他不记起 that would have prevented him from remembering
他刺伤她时的方式 the manner in which he stabbed her
然后把她控制住 让她失血过多而死呢 and then held her down while she bled to death?
抱歉 先停一停 I'm sorry.

你是说内维尔制住了她 You're saying that Neville held her down
眼睁睁地看着她死吗 and watched her die?
是 我想那是他执迷不悟的幻想中的一部分 Yes.

不 基于他的资料 这说不通 No, that doesn't make any sense, not based on his profile.
他的幻想都是关于保护 I mean, his fantasy was all about preservation.
他在借由莎拉来怀念他已故的妻子 He was immortalizing his late wife through Sarah.
你想不想听听我的专家看法 Would you like my expert opinion?
请说 博士 Please, Doctor.
唯一能真正了解一个人幻想的方法就是 The only way you can really understand someone's fantasy...
进入这个角色 is to inhabit it.
这听起来才像是个约会 Now, that sounds like a date.
我对强迫性人格并不陌生 Well, I'm no stranger to obsessive personalities,
但是这里看起来 but this seems...
就像是回到了过去 Just like stepping into the past.
你出去 然后再进来一次 All right, you go outside and come back in again.
记住 这次你是内维尔 Remember, this time, you are Neville.
亲爱的 我回来了 Hi, honey.

你在办公室经历了漫长地一天 回到家中 Did you come home from a long day at the office?
挂好你的外套 You hang up your coat,
和我说我煮的饭菜香气四溢 you tell me how wonderful my cooking smells.
这味道是熔化的奶酪 Is that the smell of molten cheese
在化学火焰上冒泡沸腾吗 bubbling over a chemical flame?
奶酪火锅 我的最爱啊 Fondue

不亲吻我一下吗 What?

抱歉 Sorry.
先生 好好享受你的酒 You, sir, go enjoy your cocktail
让你的小女人 and let your little lady
去换一件更贴身舒适的衣服 slip into something more comfortable.
我想她这一刻应该会脱光 It's at this point I think that she would disrobe,
虽然我没穿内衣 although I am not wearing any lingerie.
我的想象力可是非常丰富的 Well, I have a very vivid imagination.
我想也是 医生 I'm sure you do, Doctor.
他坐在这 请注意凹陷处 He sat here.

好 那我坐哪呢 All right, well, then where do I sit?
只有一个凹陷处 There's only one indentation.
我想你是坐在我的腿上 Well, I believe I'm your seat.
我们要精准到位 Well, we must be precise.
我的杯子 My glass.
让它去 Forget it.
污渍 A stain.
凶案发生当晚 内维尔可能把酒弄洒了 Perhaps Neville spilled his drink the night of the murder.
好 他笨手笨脚 Okay, so he's clumsy.
不不不 他讲求精确 No, no, no.

严格 Exacting.
他对清洁一丝不苟 He's meticulous about cleaning.
他到底是怎么留下这个污渍的呢 Why on earth would he have left this stain?
也许他不记得自己把酒弄洒了 Well, perhaps he didn't remember spilling it.
又或者他的酒中含有 Or perhaps there was another ingredient
另一种成分 in his evening cocktail.
喝酒 然后造访太平间 Drinks and a trip to the morgue?
这是我多年来最棒的约会 This is the best date I've had in years.
我就知道我闻出了这气味 是氯胺酮 I knew I recognized the odor

一种麻醉剂
闻起来像洗洁精 It smells like dish detergent.
内维尔说他喝酒的杯子有肥皂味 Neville said he was drinking from a soapy glass,
事实上 他是被下药了 when, in fact, he was drugged.
那是谁呢 Well, by whom?
一个想毁掉他幻想的人 Oh, someone who wanted to destroy his fantasy,
不止是想陷害他谋杀 not only frame him for murder,
并且让他相信自己就是凶手 but make him believe he was responsible.
之前你戴着新围巾迷倒了我 但是我必须承认 You had me with the new scarf, but I must admit...
现在你是真的迷倒我了 I am genuinely impressed.
我也是有那么些迷人瞬间的 Well, I...

此时此刻就有 And right now's one of 'em.
我睡懒觉的一天 My day to sleep in,
结果却接到你打来愤愤不平说着内维尔的电话 and I get a call with him raving about Neville.
我真不明白 他不是认罪了吗 You know, I don't get it.

然而在内维尔的幻想公寓里重组当时的场景 However, in re

我们发现了条线索 we discovered a clue
这对他的认罪会做进一步揭示 that will shed new light on his confession.
我们 就是 We?

在道斯教授的陪同下 她给予了很大的帮助 Professor Dawes accompanied me.

你带莫莉去了犯罪现场 You took Molly to the crime scene?
是你建议我约她出去的 Well, you're the one who suggested I ask her on a date.
可大多数人都是以吃晚饭和看电影开始 医生 Most people start with dinner and a movie, Doc.
不 我可不是 可预知性太高了 Nope, not me

不 害怕是一种被低估的催欲剂 No, fear is an underrated aphrodisiac.
策略让你受益了吗 So, did the strategy pay...

然后...

我带她回了实验室 做了毒药检测 I brought her back to the lab, and we ran a tox report
发现内维尔中毒了 which proves that Neville was poisoned.
漂亮 我猜她被迷得七荤八素了吧 Smooth!

有人能告诉我 Can someone please tell me
为什么我会在网球赛中被叫出来 why I got called in from my tennis match
查一个已经结案的案子 to work a closed case?
我们 有了新发现 We...

是 Yeah.
医生觉得有人给我们的杀人犯下了药 Doc thinks someone slipped our murderer a mickey.
准确来是氯胺酮 Ketamine, to be precise,
大概有250毫克 in the neighborhood of 250 milligrams,
当内维尔发现莎拉的尸体躺在面前 and when Neville came to with Sarah's body before him
自己手里握着一根奶酪火锅烤肉叉子时 and a fondue skewer in his hand,
他自己得出了残酷的逻辑结论 his mind leapt to the grim, logical conclusion.
结论就是他杀了她 That he killed her?
有人趁内维尔晕过去的时候 While someone else snuck in
溜了进来 while Neville was knocked out.
并且杀了他的假妻子 And killed his fake wife.
对 没错 还把凶器放在了他的手里 Yeah, right, and left the murder weapon in his hand.
我不知道 听起来...

我同意 听起来很牵强 I agree.

再跟内维尔谈谈也没有坏处 Well, it couldn't hurt to talk to Neville again.
我的下午的比赛又泡汤了 There goes my afternoon match.
内维尔先生 你有服用任何药物

比如安眠药 镇定剂吗 sleeping pills, tranquilizers?
任何 娱乐性药物[毒品]吗 Any...

案发那晚 你有喝什么东西吗 Did you have anything to drink the night of the murder?
曼哈顿鸡尾酒 跟往常一样 My usual manhattan.
怎么了 Why?
我们在现场又发现了洒掉的波本威士忌 We recovered spilt bourbon at the scene.
里面有镇静剂的成分 It was laced with a sedative.
什么镇静剂 What sedative?
氯胺酮 是一种麻醉剂 也可以用于 Ketamine.

娱乐 Recreationally.
我知道氯胺酮 I know what ketamine is.
你听到了吗 他...

你当然听到了 Of course you did.
你愿意验一下血吗 Would you be willing to subject yourself to a blood test?
我们可能会发现 We may be able to prove
有人在你的酒里加了氯胺酮 that someone slipped ketamine into your drink.
但我告诉过你们了 是我做的 But I already told you, I did it.
我杀了莎拉 I killed Sarah.
内维尔先生 我不确定你明白我说的意思 Mr.

他知道他在做什么 He knows what he's doing.
他在掩护别人 He's covering for someone.
陷害他谋杀 毁灭了他幻想的人 Someone who framed him for murder, destroyed his fantasy?
他可能会在掩护谁 Who could he possibly be covering for?
另一个因为丧妻 生活被毁了的人 Another person whose life was ruined when his wife died.
记得内维尔的幻想吗 Remember Neville's fantasy?
他得知他妻子怀孕的那晚 The night when his wife told him that she was pregnant.
塞西莉·内维尔生于1979年11月20日 Cecily Neville, born November 20, 1979.
内维尔希望永远保留的那个晚上之后九个月 Nine months after the night Neville wanted to immortalize.
难怪他想回到过去 看看这个 No wonder he wanted to go back in time.

女儿在十五岁时离家出走 轻盗窃罪 Daughter ran away from home at 15, petty larceny charge.
两年前 她因为藏毒被捕 Two years ago, she was arrested for possession.
氯胺酮 Ketamine.
难怪内维尔会背这个黑锅 No wonder Neville took the blame.
他在保护自己的女儿 He was protecting his daughter.
她现在在哪 Where is she now?
上个月假释 Paroled last month.
假释官给她在10街的咖啡屋找了个工作 P.

三天前 Three days ago,
有个女人在你以前住的公寓里被杀了 a woman was murdered in an apartment you used to live in.
好的 Okay.
对不起 那太可怕了 Sorry, that's terrible.
那个晚上 The same night,
你爸爸在同一间公寓里被下毒了 your father was drugged in the same apartment.
这越来越奇怪了 This is getting weird.
塞西莉 我们希望你能告诉我们 Cecily, we'd like you to tell us
你和你父亲的关系如何 about your relationship with your father.
没什么关系 There is none.
为什么 出什么事了吗 Why?

我爸爸不是坏人 My father wasn't a bad person.
只是他像...

他好像从来不在我身边 he wasn't ever there,
自从我妈妈去世后 not after my mom died.
我知道他不想要我 I knew he didn't want me.
我只会让他想起我妈妈 所以我离开了 I just reminded him of her

你肯定恨过他 You must have hated him.
糟糕的是那天从中午到午夜我都在这里 Too bad I was here from noon to midnight,
如果你觉得我杀了他女友 你可以问我老板 so check with my boss if you think I killed his girlfriend.
马丁内兹警探说的是"女人" Detective Martinez said "Woman,"
但你却知道你父亲和她上了床 But yet you knew he was sleeping with her.
这是我唯一一张我妈妈的照片 The only photo I have of my mom.
我从来不觉得她是真的直到...

有一天 one day,
窗外走过一个女人 长得和她一模一样 a woman walks past the window looking exactly like her

同一件外套 same jacket.
太怪异了 It was eerie.
所以我跟踪了她 So I followed her,
她进了我们以前住的大楼 and she walked into the building we used to live in.
当然 她不是我妈妈 Of course, it wasn't her,
只是个我爸爸打扮得像妈妈 just some girl my dad had dressed up to look like my mom
然后他就可以睡的女人 so he could bang her.
你看到的是这个女人吗 Is this the woman you saw?
不是 No.
对不起 Sorry.
一个健康的幻想把我们带回现实 A healthy fantasy returns us to reality.
我们也能在幻想中迷失自我 We can also lose ourselves in fantasy
并且做出理性情况下 and behave in ways
绝不会做出的行为 that our rational selves could never imagine.
下次课再见 I'll see you all next time.
道斯教授 Professor Dawes?
我在考虑转专业 I've been thinking about switching majors,
我能不能咨询下您的意见 and I was wondering if I could pick your brain?
当然 来我办公室谈吧 Sure.

内维尔说没人知道他们的七十年代秘密爱巢 Neville said no one knew about their secret '70s love nest.
没错 但是塞西莉 Yeah, yet Cecily
跟着一个穿得和她妈妈一样的女人到了这 followed a woman dressed as her dead mother there.
但如果莎拉不是神秘女子 那她是谁 But if Sarah wasn't our mystery woman, who was she

我们要找的凶手 Our killer?
我知道了 I've got it.
如果有人在模仿模仿者呢 What if someone was impersonating the impersonator?
好吧 我的脑子已经乱了 Okay, that just hurts my head.
莎拉打扮得和内维尔去世的妻子一样 Sarah was dressed as Neville's dead wife.
因为他迷恋他的妻子 Because he was obsessed with her,
那谁迷恋莎拉呢 so who was obsessed with Sarah?
谁穿得和她一样 Who dressed up as her?
还有谁能拿到她的衣服 Who else had access to her clothes?
她的室友 Her roommate.
所以你想专攻心理学 So, you want to be a psych major?
也许吧 Maybe.
我不知道 I don't know.
我在尝试不同的事物 I'm trying different things out.
大学不都是这样吗 经历 Isn't that what college is all about

教育就是教育 Well, education is what it's about.
没错 Right.
当然了 Of course.
我只是想突破我自己 I just thought maybe I could get outside myself.
你给我朋友的人生造成了巨大的影响 You made such a huge impact in my friend's life,
我很敬仰她 someone I really looked up to.
你朋友 Your friend?
莎拉·克兰西 Sarah Clancy?
你穿着她的衣服 You're wearing her coat.
我穿的时候觉得离她更近 It makes me feel closer to her when I wear it.
就像她还活着 Like she's still here.
詹妮弗 很抱歉 亲爱的 Jennifer, I am so sorry, honey,
我还有约会 要迟到了 But I'm late for my next appointment,
我们下次再聊 好吗 so let's talk later, okay?
当然 Sure.
谢谢能和我聊天 Well, thanks for chatting.

卢卡斯 Lucas.
好 我会告诉他的 Okay, I will tell him.
是卢卡斯 That was Lucas.
他说接到了一个你的骚扰电话 He said you got a crank call.
来电显示来自纽约大学心理系的 Caller I.

怎么了 What's wrong?
詹妮弗打印了莎拉今天的课表 Jennifer printed Sarah's class schedule for today.
莎拉放弃了所有课 除了一门 Sarah had dropped out of all her classes except one.
莫莉的课 Molly's.
我做了什么 What did I do?
你为什么要给警察打电话 Why did you try and call the police?
我真的搞砸了 I really messed up.
我只是想救她 I just wanted to rescue her,
让她远离那个恶心的糟老头 to get her away from that disgusting old man!
是你杀了莎拉 You killed Sarah?
我不是故意的 I didn't mean to!
我是想救她 I was trying to save her
让一切都回到原来的样子 so that things could go back to the way they were,
但她非常生气 而...

我做了什么 What do I do?

我们说实话 我陪你一起 We tell the truth.

我认识警察 I know the police.
我可以跟他们说你当时精神崩溃了 I can just tell them you had a psychotic break.
我不是什么精神病人 Look, I'm not some sort of psycho!
我没说你是 No, I'm not saying that you are.
我没有 亲爱的 这是借口 I'm not, honey.

这是一种辩护方式 That's

我们都会犯错 We all make mistakes.
会被我们的幻想蒙蔽 We

但重要的是 But what's important
我们得回到现实 is that we have to come back down to reality, okay?
无论有什么样的结果 我们一定要回到现实 No matter what the consequences, we have to.
莫莉 Molly!
莫莉 你在吗 Molly, are you there?
教授 我是马丁内兹警探 Professor?

莫莉 Molly?

天呐 Oh, god.
转身 把手放到背后 Turn around!

我是乔·马丁内兹警探 这里需要一辆救护车 This is Detective Jo Martinez.

我的大英雄 M

我已经忘了这种感觉了 I forgot what this feels like.
什么感觉 What's that?
害怕 Being scared...
不堪一击 Vulnerable.
当你敞开心扉时就会这样 Well, that's what happens when you open yourself up.
我想是这样 Yeah, I suppose.
这是好事 亨利 It's a good thing, Henry.
我相信莫莉会...

摩根医生 Dr.

病人手术结束了 Patient's out of surgery.
失血过多 但没有生命危险 She lost a lot of blood, but she's gonna be okay.
我能去看看她吗 Can I see her?
最好让她休息 Uh, it's best that she rests.
纽约警局 N.

让他进来 Let him in.
你好 亨利 Hello, Henry.
想知道个秘密吗 You want to know a secret?
我一直都有一个"遇难少女"的幻想 I've always harbored a "Damsel in distress" fantasy.
被一个英俊的医生所救 Being saved by a dashing doctor was...
太棒了 tt was kind of hot.
我不会告诉任何人的 I won't tell anyone.
不会毁了你在女性施虐界的 Wouldn't want to ruin your credibility
良好口碑的 with the dominatrix community.
谢谢 Thank you.
不过被人刺破喉咙的是我 But I'm the one that got my throat slashed,
怎么你反而看上去更憔悴呢 but, honey, you look terrible.
谢谢你 Well, thank you.
我经历了非常痛苦的一晚 It's been a harrowing evening,
坐在外头 为你担心 sitting out there, worried about you.
我不知道该怎么说 I don't know how to say this...
但我已经开始 ...But I've started to...
真的对你有感觉了 莫莉·道斯 develop real feelings for you, Molly Dawes.
这不是好事吗 Isn't that a good thing?
通常来说是的 Yes, usually.
但你不是常人 You're not a usual man, though,
也不惜代价避免任何真感情 and you avoid real feelings at all costs.
是的 Yes.
无论她是谁 都伤你伤得很深 Whoever she is, she hurt you pretty bad,
要我说就是 Let's just say the...
伤口还没愈合 wounds haven't healed yet.
我懂 I understand.
但麻烦你 亨利 But do me a favor, Henry

一旦你决定没有那么喜欢我了 就给我打电话 好吗 you ever decide you don't like me so much, you call me, okay?
所以是那个室友 So, it was the roommate,
她对我们的被害人莎拉·克兰西 She developed an unhealthy obsession
产生了一种病态的痴迷 with our victim, Sarah Clancy,
当她成了别人的幻想时 And when she lost her to someone else's fantasy,
她恼羞成怒 she snapped.
女生完全是疯子 Girl's a complete whack job.
这是术语 老大 That's the technical term, boss.
严肃点 她很可能尝试用精神疾病借口脱罪 Don't joke.

道斯教授怎么样了 So, how's Professor Dawes doing?
莫莉恢复得很好 Molly's recovering well.
那就好 我很乐见她和亨利在一起 That's good.

警署里发生的所有事都逃不过我的眼睛 I know everything that goes on in my precinct.
亚伯拉罕 Abraham?
这是...

妈妈的千层面 Mom's lasagna!
撒了独门酱汁 With secret sauce.
-惊到了我

到头来尽管 It turns out that despite
我有无比年轻 前卫的 my ever

21世纪想法 ...21st

等到要扔掉妈妈的老菜谱时 when it came down to throwing away mom's old recipes,
还是做不到 I just couldn't do it!
我把这本老菜谱拿在手里 Now, I held this old cookbook in my hands,
突然 and all of a sudden...
就想起了放学回家后的情景和那种香味 ...I remembered coming home from school and that smell.
阿比盖尔的厨艺 Abigail's cooking.
我就立马开始流起了口水 My mouth started watering right away.
我还发现 You know...

稍微怀怀旧也不是什么坏事 a pinch of nostalgia might not be such a bad thing.
有一瞬间 感觉她还在这里 For a moment, it felt like she was still here.
我了解你的感受 老爸 I know just how you feel, pops.
有些记忆非常强大 Some memories are so powerful
永不褪色 that they never fade...
好香 妈妈 Smells great, mom.
谢谢 Thank you.
绝对是巴甫洛夫风味的 It's positively Pavlovian.
每次闻到这味道 Every time I smell it,
我就会非常想 I experience this overwhelming desire
和这个漂亮的女人跳舞 to dance with a beautiful woman.
不要 No.
-要

要 Yes.
我一身油烟 I'm a mess.
你很美 You're perfect.
哪里都完美 Everything is perfect.
没想起一次 ...Memories which become more powerful
那些记忆就会更清晰一点 every time we remember them...
这只是暂时的 This can't last forever.
不要想这些 Let's not think about that.
因此也让我们现在的生活 ...Thus making our present lives
显得更加黯淡 seem a little more faded.
不过也先别想这个了 But let's not think about that now.
