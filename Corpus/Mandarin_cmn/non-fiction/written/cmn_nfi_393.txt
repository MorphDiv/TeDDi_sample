我们将繁星摘下 We pulled the stars from the skies...
用来装点地球 ...and brought them down to Earth.
代价是什么呢 But at what cost?
当我们点亮所有的灯同时 When we turned on all these lights...
也失去了一些宝贵的东西 we lost something precious.
繁星 The stars.
很久以前 只靠火光照亮 A long time ago, in a world lit only by fire,
我们和繁星之间的关系 our relationship with the stars
非常的 was far more...
贴心 personal.
几千代人以来 For thousands of generations,
我们将繁星视作生活不可或缺的部分 we watched the stars as if our lives depended on it.
确实如此 Because they did.
我们人类不算最大 We humans were not the biggest,
也不是最强壮或者最快的 the strongest, nor the fastest
相比其他动物而言 of all the animals we competed against.
但我们有个特长 But we did have one thing going for us...
我们的智慧 our intelligence.
其中一点就是识别图形的天赋 One aspect of that was a genius for pattern recognition
夜复一夜 我们仰望星空 Night after night, we watched the stars.
逐渐的 我们的祖先注意到 And over time, our ancestors noticed
夜空中星星的移动预示着地球上的变化 that the motions of the stars across the nights of the year foretold changes on Earth
威胁或者增加我们生存的机会 that threatened or enhanced our chances for survival.
在我们只能依靠想象力来体会故事的年代 In a time when our imaginations were the only stage where stories came to life,
那时没有电影或者电视 before there were movies or TVs
也没有其他的电子设备 or electronic devices of any kind,
不同的文明将这些点连成各自不同的图案 every human culture connected the dots to form their own pictures.
这些图案变成故事书中的插图 These images became the illustrations of a storybook
更深层面说来 也是一本生存手册 that, on a deeper level, was also a survival manual.
天神和英雄们的名字个性 The names and personalities of the gods, heroes,
还有动物或者类似物体的名字和个性 farm animals or familiar objects
在各个文化中各不相同 varied from culture to culture.
除了一组特定的美丽星团 But there was one particularly gorgeous group of stars
从古希腊人到现在的我们都叫它 known to the Ancient Greeks and to us today
昴宿星团 as the Pleiades,
大约1亿年前形成的星团 a star cluster formed about 100 million years ago.
每颗星都比太阳明亮40倍左右 Each of them is some 40 times brighter than our Sun.
昴宿六是最亮的一颗 And Alcyone, the most luminous,
比太阳亮1000倍 outshines our Sun 1,000 times.
以前昂宿星团被用来检测视力 For ages, the Pleiades have been used as an eye test
世界通用 for people all over the world.
能看到6颗 If you could see at least six of them,
就是普通人的标准 you were considered normal.
看到超过7颗 If you saw more than seven,
就符合战士或者侦察兵的标准了 you were an ideal candidate for a warrior or scout.
对于古凯尔特人和不列颠群岛的德鲁伊特来说 Among the Ancient Celts and Druids of the British Isles,
他们相信昂宿星团和亡魂有关 the Pleiades were believed to have a haunting significance.
一年中它们升到天空最高点的那一晚的午夜 On the night of the year that they reach the highest point in the sky at midnight,
亡魂会在地球上游荡 the spirits of the dead were thought to wander the Earth.
据信这是一个节日的起源 This is believed to be the origin of the holiday
以前叫萨温节 once known as Samhain,
现在叫万圣节 now called Halloween.
在世界各地 我们的祖先用 All over the Earth, our ancestors told
各种神奇的故事 wonderful stories to explain
来解释昂宿星团的来历 how the Pleiades came to be in the sky.
以北美洲的基奥瓦人来说 For the Kiowa people of North America,
故事是这样的 it happened something like this.
很久很久以前 一些小姑娘 Long, long ago, some young women
溜出他们的营地 snuck away from their campsite
在星空下无拘无束的跳舞 to dance freely beneath the stars.
山神 救命啊 Rock, save us!
山神 可怜可怜我们吧 Rock, take pity on us!
山神听到了她们的哭声 升起了一座高高的山峰 The rock heard their cries and grew taller.
变成了今天的魔鬼峰 Until it became what is today known as the Devil's Tower.
这些姑娘变成了昂宿星团的星星 The maidens were transformed into the stars of the Pleiades,
冬至的时候可以看到她们高高的挂在山峰上 which may be seen hanging above the tower in midwinter.
古希腊人也将这7颗明珠 The Ancient Greeks also saw those seven jewels
看做7位少女 as seven maidens,
阿特拉斯的7个女儿（负责以肩顶天的神） the seven daughters of Atlas,
不是被熊追 而是被俄里翁追 （猎户座的那个猎户） pursued not by bears, but by...

他出来溜达的时候看到了她们 who spied them when he was out walking one day.
俄里翁这个猎户兽性大发 Orion became mad with desire.
追了她们7年 For seven years, he chased them relentlessly.
精疲力尽了 "宙斯 救命啊"

她们向宙斯呼救 ...they prayed to Zeus for deliverance.
众神之王宙斯大发慈悲 Zeus, the king of the gods, felt sorry for them,
把她们7个 and transformed those seven maidens
变成了昂宿星团 into the Pleiades.
但是 神就是神经病 But the gods are, if anything, capricious.
俄里翁被蝎子蛰死后 When Orion was killed by the sting of a scorpion,
宙斯把他放在上天 让他可以继续追逐这7位姐妹 Zeus placed him in the sky where he could resume his pursuit of the seven gorgeous sisters
我们的祖先编织了各种美丽的传说 Our ancestors, they wove brilliantly imaginative stories
但是除了想象 并不能让我们更接近这些星星 But they can bring us no closer to the stars than our dreams
又过了几年前 It took yet another few thousand years
3位聪明的科学家揭开了这些星星的神秘面纱 until three brilliant scientists unlocked the secrets of the true lives of the stars
1901年 In 1901,
哈佛是男人的天下 Harvard was a man's world.
直到一位名叫爱德华・查尔斯・皮克林的天文学家 But an astronomer named Edward Charles Pickering
打破了这个规矩 broke that rule.
噢 皮克林的办公室就在走廊尽头 Oh, Pickering's office is just down the hallway.
那扇门的后面 And that door over there leads to the room
就是他的机房 where he keeps his computers.
说起来 这些女人都是"计算机" 但是 We're supposed to call those women "computers," but, uh,
我听到不少人叫她们 I've heard more than one fellow refer to those gals
皮克林的后宫 as "Pickering's Harem."
皮克林招募了一群妇女 Pickering assembled a team of women
给星星分类 绘制星图 to map and classify the types of stars.
其中一位为我们了解恒星的物质提供了 One of them provided the key to our understanding
关键的钥匙 of the substance of the stars.
还有一位给我们提供了计算 And another devised a way for us to calculate
宇宙体积的方法 the size of the universe.
你可能从没听说过她们 For some reason, you probably never heard of either of them.
想知道原因吗 Wonder why.
这个小组的组长名叫安妮・坎农 That's Annie Jump Cannon, the leader of the team.
完成时 Before she was through,
她分类了25万颗恒星 she catalogued a quarter of a million stars.
11号是一颗B7星 Number 11 is a B7.
那是昂宿星团的昂宿六 That's Alcyone in the Pleiades.
坎农因为感染猩红热而丧失了听力 Cannon lost her hearing during a bout of scarlet fever
那时她还年轻 when she was a young woman.
12号是一颗B6星 Number 12 is a B6.
那是亨丽爱塔・勒维特 也是失聪 That's Henrietta Swan Leavitt.

她就是这里另一位伟大的科学家 And she's the other great scientist in the room.
勒维特发明了天文学家沿用上百年的方法 Leavitt discovered the law that astronomers still use more than a century later
用来测量恒星之间的距离 to measure the distances to the stars
还有宇宙的体积 and the size of the cosmos itself.
安妮・坎农在一张贺卡中说明了 Annie Jump Cannon sent out a Christmas card explaining
她们正在从事的工作 what she and her sisters were actually doing.
恒星发出的光可以 The light from a star is allowed
通过望远镜中的棱镜 她写道 to fall through a prism placed in the telescope, she wrote.
经过放大 星光可以分解成一组色带 Thus magnified, the starlight is split up into a band
显示出组成的颜色 showing its component colors,
红光和紫光分别处于两端 the red rays going to one end and the violet to the other.
这就是恒星的光谱 This is the spectrum of the star.
由深色细线表示 It shows the presence of fine, dark lines.
将这些细线与实验室中发光物质做对比 By comparing them with lines given by glowing substances in the laboratory
我们可以断定这些地球上熟悉的物质 we can determine that the same elements familiar to us
同样存在于遥远的恒星上 on the Earth also exist in the outermost star.
这是12358B号 This is plate number 12358B.
这块板上的第一号是颗B类星 Number one at this plate is a B

定为B2 Make that a B2.
坎农用了几十年 It took Cannon decades
按照光谱特性 to classify the spectral character
为成千上万的恒星分门别类 of hundreds of thousands of stars
根据她制定的方法 according to the scheme that she devised.
坎农认为恒星可以 Cannon discovered that the stars fell
根据它们的光谱线图被分为7大类 into a continuous sequence of seven broad categories according to their spectral line patterns.
每个大类由一个字母代表 Each was designated by a letter.
但是相同类别的两颗恒星的光谱线 But the spectral lines of two stars in the same letter class
可能有着细微的区别 could differ in subtle ways,
坎农根据记忆察觉到的细微变化 minute variations that Cannon learned to recognize from memory.
为了区分这些光谱 To distinguish these spectra from one another,
她又将每大类分为10个用数字代表的小类 she assigned ten numerical subcategories for each class.
安妮・坎农将恒星归类 Annie Jump Cannon organized the stars,
另一位科学家负责解密她的成果中隐藏的含义 but it would fall to another scientist to decipher the hidden meaning in her work
1923年的英格兰 妇女无权 In the England of 1923, women were forbidden
在科学上获得高级学位 from pursuing advanced degrees in science.
但是塞西莉亚・佩恩在伦敦参加了一个讲座 But Cecelia Payne had attended a lecture in London
由亚瑟・爱丁顿爵士演讲 by the astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington,
他是首位证实 the first scientist to provide evidence
爱因斯坦广义相对论的科学家 that Einstein's revolutionary General Theory of Relativity was correct.
从那时起 From that moment on,
她知道没什么可以阻挡她 she knew that nothing would deter her
追求她的梦想 from pursing her big dreams.
她决定移居美国 She resolved to emigrate to America,
在那里妇女已经有了研究恒星的自由 where women had already gained the freedom to study the stars.
哈佛大学接受了她的申请 Her application was accepted at Harvard.
她随后的发现改变了一个天文学的基本观点 What she would discover there would challenge one of the central beliefs of astronomy.
造成的影响就如同现代天文物理学的曙光 The resulting impact would be the dawn of modern astrophysics.
几十年过去了 As the decades passed,
安妮・坎农和她的组员不断的筛分恒星 Annie Jump Cannon and her team kept sifting the stars,
检查每一颗的光谱特征 checking each one's spectral signature
并将它们归入 with a fleeting glance and then dropping them
7大分类中 into one of seven categories.
它们变成了图片中成千上万的像素 They became hundreds of thousands of dots
在当时还没人能够了解它的含义 in a larger picture which no one could yet understand.
这支队伍中又来了一位新的成员 Into this community of women came one more.
哈喽 Well, hello there.
你就是佩恩吧 You must be Miss Payne.
等你好久啦 We've been waiting for you.
快进来 Come on in.
塞西莉亚・佩恩第一次在科研环境中受到这样的欢迎 Cecilia Payne had never experienced such kindness in a scientific setting before.
姐妹们无私的与她分享研究成果 This sisterhood generously shared the fruits of their labors with her,
她将她们的观察结果 and she turned their observations
转化成一种对恒星的全新认识 into a radical new understanding of the stars.
两个女人变成了非常要好的朋友 The two women became great friends.
坎农把恒星光谱对佩恩倾囊相授 Cannon taught Payne everything she had learned about stellar spectra
佩恩着手分析坎农的数据 And Payne began to analyze Cannon's data
尝试着判断恒星中的化学成分与物理状态 to see if she could determine the actual chemical composition and physical state of the stars
她发挥了她的理论原子物理学专长 She brought to this work her expertise in theoretical and atomic physics
恒星光谱中最突出的特征 The most prominent features in the spectra of stars
显示了重金属元素的存在 比如钙 和铁 showed the presence of heavy elements such as calcium...

地球上最常见的那些元素 which are among the most abundant elements in the Earth.
天文学家自然而然的得出结论 So astronomers naturally concluded
恒星是由与地球相同的物质组成 that the stars were made of the same elements as the Earth
就连比例都大致相同 and in roughly the same proportions.
1924年 当时的美国天文学泰斗亨利・诺利斯・罗素 In 1924, Henry Norris Russell was the dean
为我们对于恒星的了解做出了重大的贡献 of American astronomers having made major contributions to our understanding of the stars.
地球上的40到45号化学元素 40 to 45 of the chemical elements that we have here on Earth
一样存在与太阳的光谱中 are also present in the spectrum of the Sun.
所以我们可以推断太阳的成分 So we can assume that the composition of the Sun
与地球类似 resembles that of the Earth.
如果有人能把地壳加热到发出光芒 If one were to heat the crust of the Earth to incandescence,
它的光谱就会和太阳类似 its spectrum would resemble that of the Sun.
安妮 我明白了这么多年来你的工作成果的真正意义 Annie, I think I now understand what it all means.

说来听听 Tell me.
我计算了不同温度下的光谱 I've calculated what the spectra should look like across a wide range of temperatures,
它们和你的分类法完美吻合 and they match your system of classification perfectly
恒星的光谱可以表示它的温度 The spectrum of any star tells you exactly how hot it is.
你的OBAFGKM（哈佛分类法）就是恒星的温标 Your "O

从最热到最冷 from the hottest to the coldest.
重点来了 安妮 多亏了你 Here's the headline, Annie.

我发现 恒星几乎全部是由氢和氦组成 I've discovered that the stars are made almost entirely of hydrogen and helium.
恒星中的氢和氦比金属多上百万倍 There's a million times more hydrogen and helium than the metals in the stars
我知道听上去好像挺傻 I know, it sounds daft.
你确定吗 Are you certain?
有人核对过你的计算结果吗 Has anyone else checked your calculations?
还没 我都写进我的论文里了 Not yet, but it's all in my thesis,
已经寄给罗素教授了 which is already on its way to Professor Russell.
倒霉孩子 Poor woman.
罗素对她表示遗憾 Russell felt sorry for Cecilia Payne.
在他看来 她的论文从根本上就是错的 Her thesis appeared to him to be fundamentally flawed.
显然氢和氦不可能比金属多上百万倍 It is clearly impossible that hydrogen should be a million times more abundant than the metals.
她仔细收集的证据与传统的科学观点不相符 Her carefully gathered evidence flew in the face of conventional scientific wisdom.
我怎么可能是对的 她问 "How could I be right," she asked,
那就意味着 "if that must mean
那么著名的科学家错了 that such a distinguished scientist was wrong?"
尽管她对自己的研究结果很自信 Despite her confidence in the quality of her research,
她还是在她的论文里加上了一句 "高的几乎可以肯定不真实" she caved and added a sentence to her thesis
动摇了这个非常伟大的观点 that undermined its greatest insight.
4年后 It would be four years
罗素才意识到佩恩是正确的 before Russell realized that Payne was right.
值得表扬的是 他一认识到这点 To his credit, as soon as he did,
他就承认了 这是佩恩的发现 he acknowledged that it was her discovery.
佩恩的《恒星大气》被普遍看做是 Payne's "Stellar Atmospheres" is widely regarded
天文学有史以来最杰出的博士论文 as the most brilliant PhD thesis ever written in astronomy.
它成了这个领域里教科书 It became the standard text in its field.
没有坚持我的观点是我的责任 I was to blame for not having pressed my point.
尽管我相信自己的正确 却还是屈服于权威 I had given in to authority when I believed I was right.
如果你对自己的结论有把握 If you are sure of your facts,
你就应该坚持你的立场 you should defend your position.
在其他领域 权威的言论可能占优势 The words of the powerful may prevail in other spheres of human experience
may prevail in other spheres of human experience,
但对科学来说 最关键的是证据 but in science, the only thing that counts is the evidence
以及争议本身的逻辑性 and the logic of the argument itself.
佩恩解释了安妮坎农的恒星光谱序列 Cecilia Payne's interpretation of Annie Jump Cannon's sequence
使我们可以理解恒星生命的故事 of stellar spectra made it possible for us to read the life stories of the stars
并且根据这个从它燃烧的终点追溯到它的起源 and to trace the story of life itself back to its beginnings in their fiery deaths.
有很多种恒星 There are many kinds of stars.
一些像太阳般明亮 Some are bright like the Sun.
有些暗淡 Some are dim.
最大的恒星比最小的要大上千万倍 The greatest stars are ten million  times larger than the smallest ones
有些恒星古老的超出想象 Some stars are old beyond imagining,
超过100亿岁 more than ten billion years of age.
有些才刚刚诞生 Others are being born right now.
当原子在恒星的核心中融合 When atoms fuse in the hearts of stars,
它们发出星光 they make starlight.
恒星从杂物中诞生 Stars are born in litters,
由星际云的气体和灰尘组成 formed from the gas and dust of interstellar clouds.
不同恒星的质量差异 The mass of the individual stars in a litter
从小的那些 并不比最大的行星大多少 can range from the runts

到大的那些超巨星 让太阳都相形见拙 to the supergiant stars that dwarf the Sun.
猎户座腰带下方星云中的恒星刚刚诞生 The stars in the nebula below Orion's Belt are newborns,
差不多500万岁 around five million years old,
还被包裹在诞生时的气体和灰尘中 and still swaddled in the gas and dust that gave birth to them.
昂宿星团中的恒星已经到了蹒跚学步的年纪 The stars in the Pleiades are already toddlers,
1亿岁左右 about 100 million years old.
它们已经甩开了气体和灰尘的遮盖 They've shed their blankets of gas and dust,
但依然被彼此的引力束缚在一起 but they're still bound together by their mutual gravity.
再过几亿年 Another few hundred million years,
它们才会各奔东西 and they'll drift apart and go their separate ways,
从此再不相见 never to meet again.
北斗星中的大部分恒星已经是青少年了 Most of the stars of the Big Dipper are adolescents,
5亿岁左右 roughly half a billion years old.
它们已经离开了出生时的星团 They've already drifted apart from their birth cluster,
不过 我们还是能找到它们共同的祖先 although we can still trace their common ancestry.
最终 它们会散落在银河系中 Eventually, they'll spread out around the Milky Way galaxy.
但是大部分常见的星座 But most of the familiar constellations
是由完全不相关的恒星混合而成 are a mix of entirely unrelated stars,
有些暗淡而相距不远 some faint and nearby,
有些明亮远远相隔 others bright and far away.
我们的太阳呢 Our own Sun?
从几光年开外看去 也很难找到其他相近的恒星 From the distance of even a few light

那个 It's that one.
我们的太阳已进中年 Our Sun is middle

离开出生地也很远了 and a long way from where it was born.
从同一个星际云诞生的姐妹星们 Its sister stars hatched from the same interstellar cloud,
分散在银河系各处 are dispersed throughout the galaxy.
许多都有它们各自的行星 Many of them have their own planets.
或许有些已经孕育了 Perhaps some of them nurture
智慧生物和生命的进化 the evolution of life and intelligence.
夜空中的大多数恒星 Most of the stars in our night sky
会环绕一个或多个恒星小伙伴运行 actually orbit around one or more stellar companions.
在这种双星或者多星的系统内 靠我们的肉眼 With the naked eye, we usually can't see the fainter members
通常看不到较暗的那些星 in such double and multiple star systems.
在有3个太阳的世界里 （三体！

很少有夜晚 the nights would be rare
白天也在红色和蓝色中交替 and the days might alternate between red and blue.
恒星的坍缩是注定的 It is the destiny of stars to collapse.
抬头看向夜空 所看到的成千上万的星星 Of the thousands of stars you see when you look up at the night sky,
每一个都活在两次坍缩之间 every one of them is living in an interval between two collapses...
黑暗的星际气体云团的第一次坍缩 an initial collapse of a dark, interstellar gas cloud
形成了恒星 to form the star,
明亮恒星的最后一次坍缩 and a final collapse of the luminous star
是它的生命尽头 on its way to its ultimate fate.
没有外力干扰的情况下 引力使恒星收缩 Gravity makes stars contract, unless some other force intervenes
太阳是个炽热气体组成的大球体 The Sun is a great, big ball of incandescent gas.
核心的超高温气体 The super hot gas in its core
促使太阳向外扩张 pushes the Sun to expand outward.
与此同时 太阳的引力 At the same time,the Sun's own gravity
又使它向内收缩 pulls it inward to contract.
我们的太阳处在两种力稳定平衡的状态 And our Sun is poised between these two forces in a stable equilibrium
引力和核爆炸 between gravity and nuclear fire,
这种平衡会继续 a balance it will maintain
保持40亿年 for another four billion years.
太阳消耗氢气 But as the Sun consumes hydrogen,
它的核心慢慢的收缩 its core very slowly shrinks,
而它的表面却在逐步的扩张 and the Sun's surface gradually expands in response.
在几百万年的时间里 过程很缓慢 不易察觉 It happens very slowly,imperceptibly, over the course of millions of years
但对于10亿年来说 But in about a billion years,
太阳会比现在亮出百分之10 the Sun will be ten percent brighter than it is today
百分之10 听上去不多 Ten percent may not sound like much,
但这些额外的热量会对地球造成很大的影响 but that extra heat will have a big effect on Earth.
当太阳最终耗尽它的核燃料 When the Sun finally exhausts its nuclear fuel
40或者50亿年后 four or five billion years from now,
气体会冷却 压力会下降 its gas will cool and the pressure will fall.
太阳的内部无法继续支撑外层的重量 The Sun's interior can no longer support the weight of the outer layers
最初的坍缩再次继续 and the initial collapse will resume.
万物都没有永恒 Nothing lasts forever.
恒星也会死 Even the stars die.
氦 100亿年来氢聚变的灰烬 Helium, the ash of ten billion years of hydrogen fusion,
在核心中汇聚 has built up in the core.
没有核爆炸支持它的重量 With no nuclear fire to sustain its weight,
内核坍缩 温度高的开始将氦聚合成碳和氧 the core collapses until it becomes hot enough to start fusing helium into carbon and oxygen
太阳内核的温度比以前高很多 The core of the Sun is now much hotter than it was before.
它的大气急剧膨胀 Its atmosphere rapidly expands.
在接下来的10亿年里 它膨胀到 Over the next billion years, it'll become bloated
超过现在体积的100倍 to more than 100 times its original size
变成一颗红巨星 a red giant star.
它将会覆盖并吞噬 It will envelop and devour
水星 the planets Mercury...
金星 ...and Venus...
很可能还有地球 ...and possibly the Earth.
我认为 I like to think that
在那之前的几千万年 tens of millions of years before that far distant future,
如果地球上还有生命诞生 if there still be life born of Earth,
它们应该已经在其他星球找到了新家 it will have found new homes among the stars.
一旦太阳燃尽所有的氦 Once the Sun burns through its helium,
它就开始变得非常不稳定 it will become highly unstable,
将它的外围甩向太空 casting off its outer layers into space.
超级炙热的裸露核心 The exposed, super hot core
发出高能量的紫外线潮水般的淹没四周 will flood its surroundings with high

原子们发着光 疯狂的剧烈活动 The atoms will perform a wild, fluorescent dance.
太阳会像蛋奶酥一样的收缩塌陷 The Sun will collapse like a souffle
缩小到地球体积的几百倍 shrinking a hundredfold to the size of the Earth.
到那时 太阳极度紧密 过度拥挤的电子开始相互排挤 And at that point, the Sun will be so dense that its overcrowded electrons will push back,
一切收缩都停止了 stopping any further contraction.
只有太阳中心的光核还依然坚持在那里 The kernel of light at the center will be the only part of the Sun that endures
变成了白矮星 它还会继续发出微弱的光 a white dwarf star that will go on shining dimly
再持续1千亿年 for another 100 billion years.
遥远未来的生命 Will the beings of a distant future,
从这颗星的残骸旁路过 sailing past this wreck of a star,
会想到它曾经照耀过得那些生命和世界吗 have any idea of the life and worlds that it once warmed?
普通恒星死亡时的炫目光罩转瞬即逝 The psychedelic death shrouds of ordinary stars are fleeting,
只会延续几万年的时间 lasting only tens of thousands of years
然后消散成星际气体和灰尘 before dissipating in the interstellar gas and dust
新的恒星又会从中诞生 from which the new stars will be born.
联星系统中的恒星 The stars in a binary star system
可以有不一样的命运 can have a different fate.
天狼星 夜空中最亮那颗星 Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky,
又一个非常暗淡的伴随者 has a very faint stellar companion

一颗白矮星 a white dwarf.
曾经像太阳一样 It was once a Sun

有一天 天狼星耗尽了燃料 Someday, when Sirius runs out of fuel
变成了红巨星 and becomes a red giant,
它的物质会流向白矮星 it will shed its substance onto the white dwarf.
这位伴随者的强大引力会吸引气体 The intense gravity of the companion will attract that gas,
使它们形成一个螺旋状的圆盘 pulling it into a spiraling disk.
从较大恒星出来的气体 When the gas from the larger star
落在白矮星的表面 falls onto the surface of the white dwarf,
引发核爆炸 it will trigger nuclear explosions.
最大规模的爆炸会释放 The greatest burst will release
超过太阳10万倍的能量 100,000 times more energy than the Sun.
每一次的爆炸被称为 新星（Nova） Each one of those star bursts is called a "nova,"
在拉丁语中就是 新 的意思 from the Latin for "new."
一颗质量相当于15个太阳的恒星 A star about 15 times as massive as the Sun,
比如参宿七 一颗蓝超巨星 one like Rigel, the blue supergiant
猎户座的右脚 that forms the right foot of Orion,
就有着不同的命运 has a different fate in store.
电子的压力不会使它的坍缩停止 Its collapse will not be stopped by the pressure of electrons.
它持续坍缩 The star will keep falling in on itself,
直到原子核过度拥挤 until its nuclei become so overcrowded
开始相互排斥 that they push back.
参宿七会缩小差不多10万倍 Rigel will shrink down about 100,000 times,
直到原子核之间没有距离 until there's no space left between the nuclei
无法再缩小 and it can shrink no more.
到那时 它引发 At that point, it ignites
一场更强烈的核反应 超新星 a more powerful nuclear reaction, a supernova.
大部分的恒星演变 Most stellar evolution
要经历几百万或者几十亿年 takes millions or billions of years.
但是内部的坍缩 But the interior collapse
引发超新星爆炸只需要几秒钟 that triggers a supernova explosion takes only seconds.
只剩下一个原子核 What remains will be an atomic nucleus
一个小城市那么大 the size of a small city

急速旋转的中子星被称为 脉冲星 a rapidly rotating neutron star called a pulsar.
但对于质量超过太阳30倍的恒星 But for a star more than 30 times as massive as the Sun

比如参宿二 在猎户座的腰带上 a star like Alnilam, in Orion's Belt

没什么可以阻止它的坍缩 there will be no stopping its collapse.
几百万年后 In a few million years,
参宿二燃烧殆尽 when Alnilam runs out of fuel,
它也会变成超新星 it, too, will go supernova.
崩溃的参宿二核心 The imploding core of Alnilam
质量大得 即使核力也不足以承受它的坍缩 will be so massive that not even nuclear forces
质量大得 即使核力也不足以承受它的坍缩 will be strong enough to hold off its collapse.
没有什么可以抵抗这种引力 Nothing can withstand such gravity.
密度如此惊人的恒星 And such a star has an astonishing destiny.
它会持续坍缩 It will continues to collapse,
超越时空的界限 crossing a boundary in space

称为 视界（黑洞表面） called the "event horizon,"
我们无法看到内部 beyond which we cannot see.
当它贯穿那个界限 When it traverses that frontier,
星星从我们的视线 消失得无影无踪 the star will vanish completely from sight.
它在黑洞内 It will be inside a black hole,
那里的引力无比强大 即使光也无法逃脱 a place where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.
还有一种罕见的恒星有着更戏剧化的命运 But there's an even more dramatic fate that awaits a rare kind of star
我们的银河系就有一颗 There's one of them in our galaxy.
它很不稳定 当它爆炸时 It's so unstable that when it goes,
它不会变成新星或者超新星 it won't become a mere nova or supernova.
它变成更大的灾难 It'll become something far more catastrophic...

在我们这辈子就可能发生 And it could happen in our lifetime.
澳洲内陆是地球上最好的星空观测地点之一 There are few places on Earth to get a better view of the night sky than the Australian Outback.
没有建筑物 No buildings,
没车 没路灯 什么都没有 no cars, streetlights, nothing out here;
只有星光 just lots of starlight...
偶尔有几只袋鼠 and the occasional kangaroo.
在这里 你可以非常好的观察银河系 You can get a particularly good view of the Milky Way from down here.
银河的中心 The center of our galaxy
高悬在空中 rises high in the sky,
拱形穿过天空 and it arches across the heavens
就像黑夜的脊梁 like the backbone of night.
我们的银河系是个螺旋星云 We live in a spiral galaxy.
我们看向银河时 And when we look at the Milky Way,
我们可以看到螺旋圆盘中几十亿颗恒星发出的光 we're seeing light from billions of stars in its spiral disk.
在这样美丽的夜空下 And under this beautiful dark sky,
你能看到银河并不是一片明亮 you can see that the Milky Way isn't a uniform band of light.
有些黑色的斑块遮掩了星光 There are dark patches, breaks in the starlight.
那些黑色的斑块就是星际尘埃 Those dark patches are caused by interstellar dust.
数量众多的尘埃阻挡了星光 The dust blocks the starlight, and there's lots of it.
大部分的文明中 将星星相连 Most cultures looked up at the stars and connected the dots
在夜空中组成熟悉的图案 to form familiar images in the sky.

上百万年的时间里 For a million years or more, we've watched the sky.
发生了很多事 And a lot's happened in that time.
我们的银河系中超新星爆炸大约100年一次 Supernova explode in our galaxy about once a century.
如果我们把所有遥望星空的夜晚压缩成一分钟 If we could compress all those nights of stargazing into a single minute
这是我们可以看到的景象 this is what we would see.
如果把我们的眼睛比做望远镜 Now, if our eyes were telescopes,
口径和车轮一样大 if they were light buckets as big as wagon wheels
我们又可以识别不仅仅一种光时 and our vision was not limited to just one kind of light,
我们看到的银河系就是这样的 then this is the Milky Way we would see.
近红外光中的星系 A galaxy in near

触手般四处蔓延的尘埃 with streaming tendrils of dust
被爆炸的超新星猛烈地甩出 hurled outward by those exploding supernovas,
在无数星星的映衬下显现出来 silhouetted against a backdrop of countless stars
大约7500光年以外 About 7,500 light

银河系的另一端 in another part of our galaxy,
有一场巨变 there is a place of upheaval

由恒星变成尘埃 Stars to dust
再由尘埃变为恒星 and dust to stars.
宇宙中 没有废物 In the cosmos, nothing is wasted.
但是恒星的质量有一个上限 But there's an upper limit to how massive a star can be.
17世纪时 爱德蒙・哈雷 Back in the 17th century, when Edmond Halley
跨过赤道 绘制南方的星座图 crossed the equator to map the southern constellations,
海山二（位于船底星座）看上去只是一颗暗星 Eta Carinae seemed like just another faint star.
但到了1843年 海山二 But in 1843, Eta Carinae
突然变成了天空中第二亮的星 suddenly became the second brightest star in the sky,
只是比天狼星稍暗 outshined only by Sirius.
从此开始爆发 And it's been flipping out ever since.
那个哑铃形的云团 That dumbbell

就是爆发的膨胀残余 is the expanding remnant of that event.
中心是一颗疯狂的恒星 At its center is one crazy star.
说到不稳定 Talk about unstable
海山二比太阳的质量大出至少100倍 Eta Carinae is at least 100 times more massive than the Sun,
并且发出比太阳多500万倍的光 and pouring out five million times more light.
它一直在挑战恒星质量的上限 It's pushing the upper limit of what a star can be.
还有 有证据显示 海山二 What's more, there's evidence that Eta Carinae
饱受它那邪恶兄弟的重力折磨 is being gravitationally tormented by an evil twin

那是一颗绕它运行的恒星 another massive star in orbit around it
之间的距离就像土星到太阳的距离 as close as Saturn is to the Sun.
超级巨大的恒星内核发出大量的光 The core of a supermassive star pours out so much light
以致向外的压力盖过了恒星的引力 that the outward pressure can overwhelm the star's gravity.
如果恒星过于巨大 If a star is too massive,
它的辐射压力超过它的引力 its radiation pressure overpowers its gravity
就会将这颗星炸裂 and blows the star apart.
海山二的命运 The fate of Eta Carinae was sealed
在几百万年前诞生时就已经注定 when it was born millions of years ago.
当它最终爆炸时 When it finally does blow up
说不定 已经爆炸了 and who knows, maybe it already has;
毕竟 我们看到的光 after all, we're looking at it by light that left the star
是7500年前发出的 7,500 years ago

那会是我们从没见过的大灾难 it will be a cataclysm unlike anything we've seen before.
极超新星 A hypernova.
爆炸威力大得使超新星看上去就如同鞭炮一样 An explosion so powerful, it'll make a supernova seem like a firecracker by comparison.
如果附近有太阳系 If there are nearby solar systems

都会丧失它们的大气层 could be stripped of their atmospheres
然后被死亡辐射笼罩 and bathed in deadly radiation.
它可以肆虐周围几千个恒星系统 It would wreak havoc in thousands of nearby star systems.
现在 你可能好奇 Right about now, you're probably asking yourself,
我们安全吗 "Are we safe?"
如果海山二爆炸 If Eta Carinae blows up,
地球怎么办 what happens to Earth?
放心吧 地球不会有事 Rest assured, Earth will be just fine.

然后到达表面 before making its way to the surface.
然后获得自由 And once there, it's free to fly
直接向地球飞来 straight from the Sun to the Earth
就是可见光 as visible light.
如果它撞击在叶子的表面 If it should strike the surface of a leaf,
它就被作为化学能量保存在了地球 it will be stored in the plant as chemical energy.
