AMC台"行尸走肉" 前情提要...

我要借机逃出去 I'm out of here when the time is right.
- 你家在哪?

你得和过去说再见了 You got to say goodbye.
让我来帮你 You let me help you.
我说谎了 我不是科学家 I lied.

我不知道怎么阻止这一切 I don't know how to stop it.
一个换一个 One of yours for one of mine.
好的 All right.
我现在明白了 I get it now.
"我们不是顾念所见的 "We look not at what can be seen,
乃是顾念所不见的 but we look at what cannot be seen.
因为所见的是暂时的...

所不见的是永远的 but what cannot be seen is eternal.
我们原知道 若我们居住的尘世庇护被摧毁 For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed,
必得上帝所造 we have a building from God,
不是人手所造 a house not made with hands,
在天上永存的房屋" eternal in the heavens."
她本来要和我一起走的 She was gonna come with me.
去哪儿?

弗吉尼亚 里士满郊外 Outside Richmond, Virginia.
那里很安全 It was secure.
有高墙 房屋 有20人左右 It has a wall, homes, 20 people.
Beth想和他一起走的 Beth wanted to go with him.
她想帮他到达那里 She wanted to get him there.
旅途很长 但是假如成功了 It's a long trip, but if it works out,
就是我们最后一次长途跋涉了 it's the last long trip we have to make.
假如那地方不再安全了呢?

那我们就继续旅途 Then we keep going.
找一个新的地方 Then we find a new place.
现在好多了 It's better now.

行尸走肉 第五季第9集
还有多远 How far out?
五英里 Five miles.
嘿 Carol Hey, Carol.
收到 I'm here.
我们到半路了 确认一下距离范围 We're halfway there.

大家都还在坚持 Everybody's holding tight.
我们已经走了500英里了 We've made it 500 miles.
也许走路只是简单的部分 Maybe this can be the easy part.
有可能我们已经晚了 Got to think we're due.
再给我们20分钟检查一下 Give us 20 minutes to check in.
万一听不到你们的消息 我们就去找你们 We don't hear from you, we'll come looking.
收到 Copy that.
我一直想告诉你一些事 I've been wanting to tell you something.
什么事 What's that?
那个交易 The trade.
交易没有问题 It was the right play.
它成功了 的确成功了 It worked.

只是后来发生了一些事 Just something else happened after.
只是发生了会发生的事 It went the way it had to.
顺其自然 该发生的总会发生 The way it was always going to.
我之前从没想过杀人 I never wanted to kill anybody before.
我想过 I've wanted that.
但是我杀戮心太重 But it just made it
所以除了我想要的 别的一概不理 so I didn't see anything except what I wanted.
我没有面对 I wasn't facing it.
面对什么?

面对发生的一切 What happened, what's going on.
我爸爸总是对我和Sasha说 My dad always told Sasha and me
我们世上每一个市民的职责 that it was our duty as citizens of the world
就是要随时了解新闻 to keep up with the news.
我小的时候 在他的车里 When I was little and I was in his car,
广播总是在播新闻 there were always those stories on the radio.
有些事情发生在千里之外 Something happens 1,000 miles away
有些近在咫尺 or down the block.
有些事太恐怖 听得我惊呆了 Some kind of horror I couldn't even wrap my head around.
但是他都没有转换频道 But he didn't change the channel.
也没有关掉 He didn't turn it off.
他只是继续听 He just kept listening.
面对它 To face it.
保持警惕 Keeping your eyes open.
我爸爸称此为 My dad always called that
生活的高昂代价 paying the high cost of living.
我爸爸在亚特兰大死了 I lost my dad in Atlanta.
我想他会喜欢你说的话 I think he would have liked yours.
还剩下我妈妈和一对双胞胎弟弟 Still got a mom and a couple of twin brothers.
但愿吧 I hope.
我也希望这样 I hope so, too.
还有两英里 Two more miles.
好的 All right.
在林子里停车 我们走过去 Let's pull into the woods.

不走大路 Stay off the road.
不需要这样 We don't need to.
以防万一 Just in case.
这样挺好 This is good.
透过树丛 看起来和这些报废车一样了 Through the trees, it might just look like part of the wreck.
从这条路走 It's this way.
这些是你们的人做的?

但愿吧 应该是的 Wanted to.

啊!

没事吧?

没事 没事 Yeah.

他们有侦查员和狙击手吗?

我们在辆卡车上建了一个看守点 We built a perch on a truck.
有时候会守在门口 Sometimes it's out front.
今天没有 Not today.
你听到了吗?

等等 Just wait.
Noah 等等 Noah, hold up.
Noah 等等!

来吧 没事的 Come on.

你就跟着我们吧 You're gonna be with us now.
让我来 I'll get him.
抱歉 Noah I'm sorry, Noah.
真的很抱歉 I truly am.
我们应该四处找找有用的东西再回去 We should see if there's anything we can use and head back.
然后呢?

行尸看到我们了 They see us.
我们去快速搜一下 We can make a quick sweep.
我留在他身边 I'll stay with him.
Carol 听到吗?

收到 We're here.
我们到了 We made it.
这里失陷了 It's gone.
干净衣服 Clean shirt.
- 我们会找到办法的

车库里有点垃圾袋 There's some garbage bags in the garage.
你之前就想过这地方会失陷吗?

你觉得呢?

一切发生后 After it happened,
就是Beth在医院死掉之后 right after with Beth in the hospital,
我看到那个叫Dawn的女人 I saw that woman Dawn.
她不是故意要杀她的 我知道 也看到了 She didn't mean to do it.

但是我要杀了她 But I wanted to kill her.
我记得我当时在想 杀不杀 I remember I just wondered if it even mattered
有什么分别 one way or another.
Beth也不会死而复生 Didn't have a thing to do with Beth.
我不知道我是否希望这里还未沦陷 I don't know if I thought it would still be here.
但是Beth想带他来这里 But Beth wanted to get him here.
她想让他回家 She wanted to get him back home.
这都是为了她 This was for her.
而且我们本可以住在这里的 And it could have been for us, too.
失去那些东西 那些人 I wanted to die for what I lost.
我想寻思 Who I had lost.
我就去单挑了一大群行尸 I stepped out into a crowd of those things
试着...

在被他们杀掉之前 take it all out on them
和他们拼了 until they took me.
我眼前全都是行尸 完全看不到其它 Put them all in front of me so I didn't see anything.
但我还是继续杀戮 But I just kept going.
不久后 And then later,
在Judith需要我的时候 我及时地出现 I was there for Judith when she needed me.
救了她的命 I saved her.
并送她回到了她爸爸那 I brought her back to her dad.
如果我放弃 没有选择活下去...

这一切就不会发生 if I hadn't chosen to live.
Noah啊 Noah.
Noah啊 Noah.
还没结束呢 This isn't the end.
嗯?

就是这样 There you go.
这就对了 That's right.
嘿 我们应该...

不要 Noah Noah.
不要 Noah Noah.
不要 Noah!

我在回想集装箱里的那个人 I was thinking about that guy in the storage container.
就在"终点站"那 Back at Terminus.
我是如何让大家停下 How I made us stop.
我们离开监狱后 After the prison,
在路上我找到了Maggie on my trip, I got Maggie back.
一切还算顺利 Things went okay.
失去了华盛顿的希望...

失去...

我们当时才刚刚发现她还活着...

当时我还没跟你叙旧 I hadn't caught up with you yet.
要是现在 If it were now,
我绝不会让大家停下 I wouldn't make us stop.
而是让大家立刻跑 We'd run right by.
我也会一枪毙了那个女人 And I would have shot that woman dead.
不管对错 Right or wrong.
不能再这样了 We need to stop.
我们已经出来很久了 You can be out here too long.
嘿 嘿 Hey, hey.
这是我的房子 This is my house.
你不会想进去的 You don't want to go in there.
不 我想 Yes, I do.
让我进去看看 Let me see it.
我先进 Me first.
我努力地赶过来 I tried to come back sooner.
我努力了 I tried.
但我照你说的做了 But I did what you told me to.
你没事的 坚持住 我去收拾他们 You're okay.

我去收...

至少68名共和国公民 At least 68 citizens of the Republic
在主沿海区周边发生的 have been killed in four deadly attacks
四次致命袭击中丧命 along the main coastal district.
这群行尸仍在肆意施暴 The group has continued their campaign of random violence,
毫无阻挠地向郊区移动 moving across the countryside unfettered
而眼下国家军力却乱成一盘散沙 with the republic's military forces in disarray.
我早说了 I tried to tell you.
我早跟你说了 哥们 I tried to tell you, man.
目标就是你 It was gonna be you.
你这种见不得娃娃受苦的家伙 You're the kind of guy who saves babies.
你觉得要是你当时一枪毙了我 You think Gareth would have been able to follow you guys
Gareth还会找得到你们吗?

像你妹妹一样把我碎尸万段?

哇哦 别站起来 Oh, whoa, whoa.

要是我当时不说出你们就在那 If I hadn't told them that you were there,
或许Gareth就不会来追你们 maybe Gareth wouldn't have gone after you.
或许大家都不会死 Maybe they wouldn't be dead.
或许Bob也不会死 Maybe Bob wouldn't be dead.
或者他倘若还活着的话 Maybe him being alive, maybe something about that
Beth的结局也会有所改变 would have changed things with Beth.
就像多米诺骨牌 Domino shit.
又或者不会 Maybe not.
或者你现在不会被咬到 Maybe you wouldn't be bit right now.
哥们 简直是一派胡言 Man, that is bullshit.
我是在食物库被咬到的 I got bit at the food bank.
事情都是注定的 It went the way it had to,
注定发生的一定会发生 the way it was always going to.
你现在的情况也一样 Just like this.
然后在晚上对村庄进行施暴 Then terrorizing the village by night,
展开复仇袭击 carrying out revenge attacks
包括用大砍刀砍杀无辜的人 involving hacking innocents with machetes
更有甚者 放火杀人 and, in some cases, setting them on fire.
如果你好好做 If you just did it,
而不是像个婊子一样撒谎 if you didn't lie like a bitch,
事情或许会有转机 it might he changed things.
或许账就能付清了 Maybe the bill would have been paid.
账一定要付清 The bill has to be paid.
你不得不挣得生计 You have to earn your keep.
你告诉我为了挣得生计 你什么都敢做 You told me you'd do whatever you had to do to earn your keep.
这是你的原话 That's what you said.
嗯?

还记得吗?

现在好多了 Tyreese It's better now, Tyreese.
真的 It is.
现在好多了 It's better now.
并没有变好 It's not better now.
你很清楚什么...

我们可以用几扇车库门堵住缺口 We could put some of the garage doors together against the break.
在重新筑好墙前 停辆车在那挡着 Park a car against them until we can brick it back up.
行得通的 It can work.
这地方周围都是树 This place is surrounded by a forest.
没有清晰的视线 There's no sight lines.
即便是有东西混进来 Whoever, whatever would
我们也察觉不到 be on top of us without us even knowing it.
这里大概就是这么回事 That's probably what happened.
我们当时就这么回事 That's what happened to us.
我们可以一点点把树砍了 We could start taking down the trees.
用来盖面高墙 We use them to build the walls up.
过来看 Look.
都不重要了 It doesn't matter.
怎么了?

你说你想知道 You said you wondered if
当时杀了她是否有用 it even mattered if you killed her or not.
不管当时是你 我 还是Daryl这么做了 It doesn't matter if you had done it
都不重要了 or if I had, or that Daryl did.
根本不重要 It doesn't matter.
华盛顿 Washington.
Eugene撒谎说有解药 Eugene lied about a cure,
但他想到华盛顿去是有原因的 but he thought of Washington for a reason.
可他是在说谎 But he was lying.
解药是骗人的 但他肯定盘算过了 About the cure, but he did the math
并且意识到华盛顿 and realized that Washington
是唯一有一线生机的地方 was the place where there'd be a chance.
我们离那儿很近 We're close.
万一那有人呢?

万一那里安全呢?

离那里就100英里了 We're 100 miles away.
有这种可能 It's a possibility.
这是个机会 It's a chance.
总比在这等死好 Instead of just being out here.
总比自己重建避难所好 Instead of just making it.
因为现在 这里就是这个鬼样 Because right now, this is what making it looks like.
你们难道不想有机会多活一天吗?

我们得走了 We should go.
就100英里远 It's 100 miles away.
我们应该去华盛顿 We should go to Washington.
嘿 Rick!

救我 Rick!

救命!

Noah 坚持住!

我来解决他 I got him.
你还好吗?

- Tyreese出事了!

在我家里 他被咬了 My house.
