我们认为你弟弟可能在谋杀当晚 We think your brother may have been in contact with the victim
和受害者有联系 the night of the murder.
他们只是有联系 So they were in contact.
逮捕他好像有点小题大做了 Arresting him seems a little over

我们也不想的 但他逃跑了 We'd prefer not to, but he fled.
什么?

我们派了人去 We sent officers
你弟弟在俄州的房子 to your brother's house in Oklahoma City.
他从后门溜走了 He slipped out the back door.
我们试图联系他 He hasn't responded
但他没有回应 to our attempts to communicate with him.
你能联系到他吗?

嗯 应该可以 Yeah.

你们不亲近吗?

他会去让他感觉安全的地方 he's gonna go someplace where he feels safe.
你知道可能是哪儿吗?

很可能是我父母的老房子 My parents' old house, probably.
听起来挺对的 Sounds right.

全部 同时掐死 All of them.

我批准你请假 I'll clear your leave.
随你离开多久 Take as much time as you need.
真的?

去照顾好家人吧 Go and take care of your family.
我得去趟芝加哥 找到Jimmy 把他带回来 I have to go to Chicago, find Jimmy, bring him back here.
好的 Okay.
我应该只去几天 I should only be gone a couple of days.
要知道 如果你想让我去 我可以跟你去的 You know, I can come with you if you want me to.
这对你来说没意思 That wouldn't be any fun for you.
高估了有意思一词 Fun's overrated.
如果你想去 你可以去 If you want to come, you can come.
你想我去吗?

如果你去的话 我非常乐意 I would very much like it if you came.
好的 那我就去 All right.

我们一起去 We'll do it together.

他是被打死的 He'd been beaten to death.
法医鉴定除了有头骨破裂以外 The M.

还有瘀伤和多处肋骨骨折 in addition to a busted skull.
听起来可不像抢劫出问题杀人灭口 That doesn't sound like a robbery gone wrong.
他参与过许多受虐妇女的志愿服务 Well, he did a lot of pro

达拉斯警方认为凶手也许是愤怒的男友 Dallas cops think it was probably an angry boyfriend
或丈夫所为 or husband.

还记得那时我把你锁在门外 Remember when you sat for me and I locked you out of the house
你从地下室的窗户外扔了块砖头 and you threw a brick through the basement window
才进来的吗?

那完全是我的错 And it was completely my fault,

那是我的手机 That's my phone.
没错 有了 Yes, it is.
他今早打过电话 He called this morning.

我就知道这么多 That's all I got.
谢谢 Thanks.
你妈找你 Your mom called.
也许你应该打回去 Should probably call her back.
再见 T.

嗨 Hey.
姐 你来这干嘛?

警察发了针对你的逮捕令 There's a warrant out for your arrest.
要你接受美国联邦检察官的质询 You're wanted for questioning by the U.

而你却逃跑了 and you ran away.
你知不知道给自己找了多大的麻烦?

钓到什么了吗?

没有吧 No.
你男朋友?

- 他叫Patrick

我想帮你 I want to help.
我要你帮了吗?

- 没有 但你是我弟弟

可笑的是 只有你认为我搞砸的时候 You know, it's funny how I'm only your brother
才会把我当弟弟看 when you think I messed up.
听着 跟联邦调查局探员聊天 Look, talking to an FBI agent
可不是什么好主意 is not a great idea for me right now.
这会让我跟一个非常危险的人 Talking to the feds is gonna get me in hot water
纠缠不清 with a very dangerous guy.
谁?

家里进人了吗?

嗯 有人闯进去了 Yeah, somebody broke into the house.
Stan说他觉得是去要赌债的 Stan says he thinks he was there to collect a gambling debt.

他说得对吧?

那人是不是要债的?

我不知道 可能吧 I don't know.

你又开始赌博了?

你在打扑克吗?

你能不能暂时别管我?

呃 你要不介意的话 Uh, do you mind if I have a little talk
我想和你弟弟单独谈谈 with your brother alone?
无意冒犯 但是"姐姐的男朋友" No offense, but "Sister's boyfriend"
这身份好像对我来说没有什么权威吧?

我来和你谈条件 Let me offer you a deal.
你跟着你姐姐和我一起回德州 You come back to Texas with your sister and me,
你不需要去作证 and you'll never have to testify.
也不会有人知道是你帮助了我们 And no one will ever know that you helped us.
这种事你怎么办得到?

我们会抓到凶手 We'll catch the killer
让他们不需要你的证词 in a way that your testimony will be unnecessary.
这样就好了?

呃 我说得比较简单 但就是这样 Well, I skipped a few steps in the middle, but yeah.
我都不认识你 哥们 I don't even know you, man.
我为什么要相信你?

因为我还没有告诉你的姐姐 Because I haven't told your sister
屋子里那人是什么来头 有什么目的 about the man in the house and why he was really there.
我知道他不是从达拉斯来的 I know he's not from Dallas,
而且我也不觉得他是去 and I don't think that he was there
收赌债的 to collect on a gambling debt.
要我接着说吗?

不需要了 No.
听着 我...

我在乎她 I care about her.
我也在乎她所在乎的人 And I care about the people that she cares about.

好吧 但我不想听你教育我 Okay, but I don't want to hear about it.
我在Wrightwood酒店打扑克 I was at a poker game at the Wrightwood hotel.
你为了打扑克 开车去达拉斯?

这离俄克拉何马州只有三个小时的车程 It's three hours from Oklahoma city.
你也会开三个小时的车去打扑克啊 You'd drive three hours for a good game.
不 我不会 No, I wouldn't.
那肯定是我的另一个姐姐 It must've been my other big sister
教我怎么打牌的了?

受害人也在打牌吗?

是的 Nathan在场 Yeah.

我们开始聊天 We got to talking.
他说他需要有人帮他做一些电工 He said he had some electrical work needed done.

几杯加奎宁水的杜松子酒过后 他就是个喝醉了的话痨 He was a chatty drunk after a few gin and tonics.
就这样了 So, there you go.
希望你们能抓到他 Have fun catching him.
我不确定Holiday是我们要找的人 I'm not sure Holiday's our guy.
为什么?

向死人要钱可不容易 It's hard to get money out of a dead man.
凶手几乎可以肯定是一起打扑克的人 The killer is almost certainly a part of that poker game.
我们需要混进去 We need to get in on that.
不用想了 我花了好几个星期呢 Forget it.

我用神奇的扑克技术才打动了Holiday I had to charm Holiday with my mad poker skills.

我告诉她说我们案件有突破了 I told her that we caught a break in the case.
她不太高兴 但是她答应 She wasn't happy, but she agreed
让我们继续调查72个小时 to let us follow it for 72 hours.
如果我们按时找到一个嫌疑人 那接下来就是她的责任了 Now, if we find a suspect in that time, the collar is hers.

他非常生气 He was ticked off.
那关系到了很多钱 There was a lot of money involved.
我们就是这样认识他的 你懂的 看文件知道的 That's how we know him.

德州 达拉斯 Wrightwood酒店

我们该谈的就是你母亲 Oh, I think we need to talk about your mother.
我觉得你需要冷静 No, I think you need to calm down.
别和我说这种屁话 Do not tell me to calm down.
说真的 你这样让我很尴尬 Seriously, you're embarrassing me.

喂?

Teresa 我只能想到和你电话 Teresa, I didn't know who else to call.
Karen?

Stan被打了 Stan got beat up.
天啊 他没事吧?

他说只是工作时候不小心弄的 He said it was an accident at work.
但是我觉得不像 I don't believe him.
姐 你别管了 Leave it alone, T.
不行 你老婆都快吓死了 No.

谁打的?

一群醉汉 A couple of guys got drunk
然后就来找我麻烦 可以了吗?

你可不是这么跟Karen说的 为什么骗我?

我没有 I'm not.
我听得出真假 Stan Look, I know crap when I hear it, Stan.
如果Jimmy害你涉险 我绝不轻饶他 I am gonna kill Jimmy for getting you involved in this.
你就别管了 好吗?

我一会再打给你 I'll talk to you later.
一定要接住这个球 Got to catch that.
Stan是怎么回事?

什么?

那天你和Jane在湖边谈的就是这个...

所以你才同意跟我来这里 why you agreed to come out here.
你隐瞒了Stan的事情 You're hiding something about Stan.
Jimmy...

告诉我究竟发生了什么事 Tell me what's going on.
Stan的生意有几段时间很惨淡 Stan had a couple bad breaks in his business.
Karen上次怀孕的时候他们很拮据 Karen's last pregnancy was tough.
他不得不伸手找人借钱 He got behind on his bills.
可是他找错了借钱对象 He owes money to the wrong people.
高利贷 他欠了多少钱?

三万以上 Over 30 grand.
三万?

那个袭击了Jane的男人...

他不是去找你的 He wasn't looking for you.
他是冲着Stan去的 He was there for Stan.
你为什么要替他打幌子?

Stan 他一直...

就希望你能为他骄傲 Just wanted you to be proud of him.
我是为他感到骄傲啊 I am proud of him.
你们几个都让我很骄傲 I'm proud of all of you.
真的吗?

我拿到电工许可证的时候 你给我打过电话吗?

一直以来 你打电话给我就会骂我 You only call to yell at me, just like always.
听着 我知道你们还小的时候 Look, I know I was tough on you
我对你们一直太过严厉 可是拜托 when you were a kid, but come on.
你也知道老爸老妈在的话是一样的 You know what mom and dad were like.
总有人需要负责 Somebody had to be responsible,
总有人需要来管教你们 And somebody had to be in charge.
是吗?

可是你走了 Then you left.
Jimmy要参加牌局吗?

恩 他得参加 Yeah.

- 他也得跟着赌吗?

好吧 那我也要去 Well, then I'm gonna be there.
他会安然无恙的 我们会盯紧那些人的 He'll be safe.

那是我亲弟弟 我必须在场 He's my little brother.

当然可以 Yeah, of course.
计划怎么进行呢?

Jimmy会和所有嫌疑人联系 Jimmy's gonna make contact with all the suspects.
Holiday已经发出邀请了 Holiday's sending the invitation.
Jimmy要做的就是确保他们都会出席 Jimmy's gonna make sure they show up.
我是McInnis McInnis.
嗨 Charlie 我是上次牌局里的那个Jimmy Charlie, hey.

好呀 牌局里的那个Jimmy Well, hello, Jimmy from the poker game.
怎么了?

你收到George Holiday的邀请了吗?

今晚有牌局 There's a game tonight.
然后他会说出让其他人 And then he will use the word
都很愿意参加的话 that makes every poker player smell blood.
跟你说哦 Ben I'm telling you, Ben.
这家伙可有钱了 This guy's a whale.

我一个朋友和他一起玩过 One of my friends played with him.
这男的一晚上就输了两万 This guy dropped like $20,000 in one night.
真的吗?

他牌技可臭了 He's a terrible player.
还一点也不在乎输赢 Doesn't care if he wins or loses.
只是一心求赌 Just wants action.
我们要让他输个精光 We'll clean him out.
德州 达拉斯
监控的情况怎么样了?

摄像头正在启动...

房间里有Holiday和Jimmy Lisbon Charlie McInnis和Vicki Shell Holiday, Jimmy Lisbon, Charlie McInnis, Vicki Shell,
Benben也到了 and Benben are in the room.
好 All right.
告诉Jane和Lisbon 我们准备好了 Tell Jane and Lisbon we're ready.
是 Yep.
Wyllie打来的 说他们都准备好了 That was Wyllie.

抱歉...

走吧 Let's go.
你的弟弟们并不是讨厌你 Your brothers don't hate you, you know.
才怪 他们讨厌我 Yeah, they do.
他们没有 No, they don't.
Jimmy说得对...

在我母亲去世后 我本应该履行家长的职责 可是我却走了 After my mom died, I was the parent, and I left.
你感到受困了 这是可以理解的 Well, you felt trapped.

现在Stan的生活乱作一团 Jimmy有赌博问题 Now Stan's life is a mess, Jimmy's got a gambling problem,
天知道Tommy怎么样了 And god only knows what Tommy's up to.
确实如此 听着 他们的确各自有些麻烦 Yeah, sure, look, t...

但是他们都不是坏人 But they're good people.
如果他们小时候 And they wouldn't even be here
没有你的爱和保护 根本就不能安然生活到现在 if you hadn't loved and protected them when they were kids.
你和他们在一起的时候会不自在 只是因为自己的愧疚感 You're uncomfortable around them because you feel guilt.
我理解 I understand that.
可是你要知道 他们并没有生你的气 But you need to know they're not mad at you.
他们没有 They're not.
他们只是想你了 They just miss you.
你早就知道是怎么回事了...

Stan和Jimmy 还有房子里那个男人 with Stan and Jimmy and the guy at the house.
你早看出来了 You figured it out,
可是你却选择不告诉我 And you didn't say a word to me.
好吧...

谢谢你 Thank you.
好了 走吧 All right, let's go.
我们还有一场戏要演 We've got a game to get to.
确实 Absolutely.
欢迎 你还记得Teresa吗?

我只是来旁观的 I'm just here to watch.
别客气 亲爱的 Make yourself at home, darling.
如果你再赢我的钱 可得请我吃饭 Take any more of my money, you're gonna have to buy me dinner.
还不一定呢 We'll see.
上周手气欠佳啊 Charlie That was a bad beat last week, Charlie.
你只管打牌就好 You don't have to do anything other than play poker.
集中精力玩牌 剩下的交给我 Focus on the game.

交给你什么?

一会儿你就知道 You'll see.
首先 再来一杯酒 First, another drink.
厕所坏了 Toilet's busted.
堵了?

冲不下去 It's not flushing.
别进去 Don't go in there.
好吧 大家想怎么办?

你们要收拾东西换个房间吗?

我们...

就因为下水管堵了?

我来这儿可不是为了上厕所 I mean, I...

我是来玩牌的 I came here to play poker.
快点玩牌吧 Let's just play poker.
既然想玩牌 Man wants to play cards.
那就玩吧 好了 So be it.

走廊尽头有洗手间 There is a washroom down at the end of the hall
在健身俱乐部旁边 by the health club.
可以走过去 或者憋一会儿 Take a walk or hold your water.
我是Patrick Jane Patrick Jane.
这是我的女朋友 Teresa That's my girlfriend, Teresa.
我就是来看看然后蹭酒喝 I'm just here to watch and enjoy the open bar.
我们玩的是德州扑克 The game is Texas hold'em.
无限下注 No limit.
稍等一下 Start off a little slow.
开始了 And away we go.
Jane在作弊?

对 但他不是为了赢 Yeah, but he isn't playing to win.
他盯着这些人 是为了看穿他们的马脚...

哦 转牌是一张什么呢?

就是玩家拿到好牌或者坏牌的时候 Subtle behaviors a player makes
他的小动作 when he has a good or a bad hand.
我知道马脚是什么意思 I know what a tell is.
摸鼻子 Nose rub.
她上次摸鼻子的时候 拿了一手同花 Last time she did that, she got a flush.
摸鼻子就是她的马脚 The nose rub is her tell.
哈 说中了 Ha.

好戏开始了 Okay, game on.
晃动 他晃来晃去的 Rocking.

哦!

抓头发 Hair scratch.
马脚都找到了 That's all of them.
该到第二阶段了 Time for phase two.
轮到我了是吧?

大家都还不错吧?

一切顺利吗 亲爱的?

不知道 I don't know.
这间屋子感觉怪怪的 There's something disturbing in this room.
啊 她有点敏感 有点通灵那种 Ah, she's a little sensitive, a little psychic.
- 通灵?

最近这里有人被杀吗?

天啊 Oh, my god.
是有一个玩家被杀 但不在这间屋子里 Uh, not in this room, but, yeah, one of our players was killed.
Nate...

是Nathan Uh, Nathan.
这是...

我真心感觉别扭 This is getting a little weird.
她很神奇不是吗?

虽然有点诡异 Uh, it's kind of uncanny.
是啊 Yeah.
好好玩扑克 行吗?

我压了 I'm in.
- 抱歉

- 还有呢

我感觉到更黑暗的存在 I'm feeling a darker presence.
凶手就在这个房间里 The killer is in this room.
- 拜托

等等 不要摸牌 Wait.

牌里有A的人就是凶手 The killer is the one who has the ace.
事情变得有趣了 I think things just got interesting.
她说有A的人就是凶手 She says the killer's holding an ace.
我很好奇 I'm curious.
是McInnis It's McInnis.
看起来老爹要进牢房了 Looks like daddy's going to the big house.
哎呀 Whoops.
我再去喝一杯 Gonna go get myself a drink.
我看也没有那么通灵嘛 Not so much of a psychic after all, I guess.
现在可以玩牌了吧?

可以抓人了吗?

再等等 Not yet.
现在Jane要确保McInnis赢 Now Jane makes sure McInnis wins.
啊 你赢了 Ah, take it.
当心 老爹 Oh, look out, daddy.
算你走运 Lucky guy.
- 你也不错 不错

今晚很愉快吧 You're having a good night.
嗯哼 Mm

好了 我要走一段长路 Okay, I am now gonna take the long walk
去下洗手间 to the little boy's room.
我觉得有点热 不知道你们怎么样 Feeling a little warm.

该喝杯酒了 Time for a drink.
或者两杯 Or two.
你喝点什么?

这是什么鬼东西?

什么?

亲爱的 我们要走了 Honey, we're leaving.
什么?

我们正在玩牌呢 We're in the middle of a game.
这里有个隐蔽摄像头 Uh, there's a hidden camera here.
什么?

在这儿 There.
摄像头?

搞什么?

McInnis先生 Mr.

我是联邦调查局的Kimball Cho探员 Agent Kimball Cho...

这是什么?

我们知道是你杀了Nathan Barnes We know you killed Nathan Barnes.
什么?

房间里有我们的探员 Holiday已经知道是你了 Our agents in the room are telling Holiday it was you.
难怪McInnis今晚一直赢 McInnis has been winning all night.
有人在旁边房间监视 帮他看牌 He's got someone watching in another room, feeding him cards.
天啊 Oh, geez.
Barnes欠了Holiday很多钱 Now, Barnes owed Holiday a lot of money.
你杀了Nathan Barnes 就没人给他还钱了 By killing Nathan Barnes, you cheated him out of it.
这是现场直播 This is a live feed.
如果你自首 我们可以保护你 Turn yourself in for the murder, and we'll protect you.
听着 我不明白你在说什么 真是疯了 Look, I don't know what this is, but this is really crazy.
那你就跟Holiday慢慢谈吧 Have fun telling Holiday that.
McInnis 快回来 McInnis, come on back.
我们都等着你呢 We're waiting on you.
快点 孩子 Come on, son.
该你发牌了 It's your turn to deal.
回来接着玩啊 Come on back and play.
带我离开这儿 Get me out of here.
你选对了 走吧 Good choice.

你要去哪儿?

我的未婚妻Heidi花很多时间 My fiancee Heidi started spending a lot of time
帮Nathan做法律无偿援助的工作 helping Nathan with his pro

我怀疑她跟Nathan有一腿 I suspected she was cheating on me.
之前我没有证据 I didn't have proof
直到那天晚上Nathan来玩牌 until Nathan showed up at the game that night.
当时我输得很惨 I was losing that night...

然后我突然间发现 Something was off.

Nathan穿的是我的衬衫 Nathan was wearing one of my shirts.
你怎么知道是你的?

因为袖口上的字母缩写 My monogram on the cuff.
肯定是Nathan跟Heidi睡过以后 Nathan was sleeping with Heidi.
在她公寓里随手错拿了 Must've grabbed one of my shirts at her apartment
我的衬衣 instead of his.
那天晚上他赢了我很多钱 He took a lot of money from me that night,
而且他...

那个小混蛋 Ugh, that little bastard.
他故意给我难堪 He was just rubbing it in my face.
他就爱看我出丑 He knew I knew, and he loved it.
我跟着他出了门 I followed him out.
我跟他当面对质 I confronted him.
他居然不承认...

可是他穿的衬衫就是证据 But he was wearing the proof.
我们问过你的未婚妻 We spoke with your fiancee.
Heidi那天跟Nathan Heidi had gone to coffee
去了她公寓附近的咖啡馆 with Nathan in her neighborhood that day.
Nathan把咖啡洒在自己的衬衫上 Nathan spilled coffee on his shirt,
然后她借了一件你的干净衬衫给他 and she gave him one of your clean shirts to borrow.
他跟你唯一的交集就是玩牌赢了你很多钱 The only thing he ever did to you was beat you in cards.
聚会不错 Nice party.
我们这边都这样 This is how we do it.
嘿 Hey.
- 干杯

德克萨斯女孩喝玛格丽塔 Oh, Texas girls drink margaritas.
- 把啤酒给我

嘿 我们这儿有汉堡 Hey, we got, uh, burgers,
香肠 还有压缩蔬菜饼 如果你想要的话 brats, veggie

你的脸看上去好多了 Your face looks better.
还是有点疼 Eh, it's still a little sore.
我知道你遇上麻烦了 Stan I know you're in trouble, Stan.
只要我能帮上忙 你尽管说 Whatever I can do to help, let me help.
你没必要这样做 You don't have to do that.
我知道没必要 I know I don't have to.
但是我想帮你 I want to.
只要能让你的脸 Just enough to keep you
别再挨打 就可以了 from getting punched in the face again.
我还有点儿以为 I kind of thought you wouldn't mind
你不在意我被揍了一顿呢 seeing me get punched in the face.
我是唯一能打你的人 I'm the only one who gets to punch you.
- 好吧

不用了 I'm good.
嘿 你能过来我很高兴 Hey, I'm glad you made it out.
真的很重要 It means a lot.
Karen的家人对你印象非常深刻 And Karen's family was really impressed with you.
我也对你印象深刻 I'm impressed with you.
我为你自豪 姐 I'm proud of you, T.
谢了 Thanks.
我们应该多在一起玩 We should hang out more.
像正常人那样?

是的 像正常人那样 Yeah, like normal people.
的确 这次就挺有趣的 We should.

只可惜木先生没来 It's too bad Woody Squire couldn't make it.
真的非常遗憾 是啊 It's a real shame about that.

闭嘴 Shut up.
我们聊了Patrick We talked about Patrick.
- 是吗?

我们喜欢他 We like him.
他人不错 He's a good guy.
这次别搞砸了 好吗?

我尽量 I'll try not to.
真高兴我们回家了 I'm glad we came back home.
我也是 Me too.
感觉不错 It was nice.
我觉得我没说过这个 I don't think I've said this.
我知道我没说过 I mean, I know I haven't said this,
但我也不知道有没有必要说 but I don't really know if I need to
因为你总是知道我在想什么 Because you always know what I'm thinking.
倒也不是全部 Well, not everything.
如果我说我爱你 你会惊讶吗?

我会...

如果我没说我很感动 那肯定是撒谎 I'd be lying if I didn't say I would be moved by that.
我爱你 I love you.
我说了 I said it.
我很惊讶 I'm surprised.
