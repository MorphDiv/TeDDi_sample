我是Brian Finch My name is Brian Finch.
是个生活一团糟的28岁小青年 I was your average 28

不过吃了NZT之后 一切就变了 until I took a pill called NZT.
瞬间我就能善用每一个脑细胞 Suddenly I had access to every brain cell.
每次在他服用药片之后的12个小时里 Every time he takes it, for the next 12 hours,
他就是这世界上最聪明的人 He basically becomes the smartest person in the world.
所以联邦调查局雇用我 And that's why the FBI hired me.
我是Brian Finch My name's Brian Finch,
她是Rebecca Harris this is Rebecca Harris,
我们是联邦调查局的 and we're with the FBI.
天啊 听起来好赞 God, that sounds cool.
不过 有一个问题 There's just one problem.
NZT会透支你的生命 Nzt will kill you,
除非你注射了这玩意儿 unless you have this shot.
现在起 你可以随心所欲的服用NZT 并且毫无副作用 Now you can have as much NZT as you want with no side effects.
你为什么愿意帮助我?

这么说吧 我这里有个职位 Let's just say I need somebody
正好缺人 in your position.
如果你向联调局的人或者任何人 If you describe to the FBI, or anyone,
透露今天的事...

我会让你死得比你想象中的 I will let you die more painfully
更缓慢更痛苦 and slowly than you can fathom.
Brian 准备好成为一个大人物了吗?

永无止境 前情提要...

我觉得我父亲那天晚上服用了NZT I think my father was on NZT that night,
如果我查出来这药是从哪里来的 and if I can figure out where it comes from,
也许我就可以查出我父亲的死因 maybe I can figure out what happened to him.
是时候让你做点事了 It's time to make yourself useful.
我们对NZT有所了解 We know quite a lot about nzt outside of the fence.
但联邦调查局不是省油的灯 FBI is playing catch

我要你找出联邦调查局对NZT的了解程度 I want you to find out exactly what they know
然后带来给我 and bring it to me.
那是你爸爸画的?

我觉得我的父亲被杀之前 I think my father was taking
在服用NZT NZT before he got killed.
所以 假如 So, if he was finally
他又开始画画了 那就是原因 painting again, that's why.
如果我的父亲去世了 而我知道 If my dad was gone, and I learned
人世间还留存着他的作品 there was something out there he had made,
我不会去无视的 I don't think I could ignore it.
对了 Right.
昨晚 Last night.
播放我
嘿 老兄 Hey, buddy.
不要误会我 Now, don't take this the wrong way,
但是我给你拍了一个教学视频 but I made you an instructional video.
我知道这些东西你大多都记得 Now, I know you remember most of this stuff.
毕竟 你就是我嘛 You are me, after all.
但你是没有服用NZT的我 But you're me without NZT.
那就开诚布公 And let's be honest,
你转变后有些东西遗忘了 Some stuff gets lost in translation.
Rebecca很厉害 So, Rebecca's awesome.
我很厉害 她很厉害
我知道 你知道 我们都知道 I know this, you know this, we know this.
而你又知道联邦调查局手上有她爸爸的档案 And you just learned the FBI has a file on her dad,
也证明了 他死前服用了NZT which shows he was using NZT before he died.
你想告诉她吗?

当然想 Of course you do.
因为你是老好人先生 You're Mr.

你想为每个人都好 但是事实是这样 You want what's best for everyone, but here's the thing.
而且我要把这件事说得很清楚 And I want to be very clear about this
这样 没有服用NZT时你都能记住 so that you can remember it even without NZT.
你不能告诉她
你去偷了文件 是奉Edward Morra参议员的 You stole those files at the behest of Senator Edward Morra's
"奴才"的命令 我猜你这么叫他 minion, I guess you'd call him.
但是偷文件犯了叛国罪 Stealing them was treason.
他们会把这种罪犯...

关进超级大监狱的 in supermax prison for it.
你要非常 非常的谨慎 You have to be very, very careful.
我们假设你非要告诉她 Let's just say you do tell her.
"嘿 Rebecca 既然咱们是好朋友 "Hey, Rebecca, it just seems fair that we talk
咱们谈谈这事也没啥大不了的" since we're such good friends and stuff."
然后她想知道一切你所知道的 Then she wants to know how you know.
她不相信你的借口 最后你还是...

被关进了超级大监狱 in supermax prison.
不相信她会告发你?

"嘿 Rebecca 我知道你不会 "Hey, Rebecca, I know you won't do anything compromising
把我告诉你的消息告诉别人 with the information I just handed you
因为咱们是好朋友嘛" because we're such good friends and stuff."
但是接着她抓狂去和上司对质 But then she gets so mad that she confronts her boss.
最后怎样 你也猜到了 And you wind up in you guessed it
被关进超级大监狱 supermax prison.
你知道进了超级大监狱会怎样吗?

大概不是被大鞋子踩死 Probably not death by giant boot.
当然 假如Sands先生发现了 Of course, if Mr.

你联邦调查局的好朋友们 that you told your FBI BFF
知道了他给你秘密任务的事情 about the secret mission he gave you,
你就会祈祷宁愿被大鞋子踩死 you will be praying for death by giant boot.
听着 你正处于非常危险的境地 Look, you're in the middle of a very dangerous situation
会有一千种死法等着你 with a number of potentially awful outcomes,
但是咱们可以渡过这一难关 but we can get through it.
我可以让咱们渡过这一难关 I can get us through it.
但是你要听话 But only if you listen.
你不能再当老好人先生了 You can't be Mr.

你要当恶人Brain You got to be badass Brian.
恶人Brain会独守秘密 Badass Brian keeps his secrets private.
恶人Brain只顾着他自己 而且最重要的是 Badass brian looks out for himself, and most importantly,
等这一切过去了 恶人Brain就拍拍屁股走人 when all this is over, badass Brian gets to walk away,
自由地活着 free and alive.
有什么问题吗?

没有 一切都好 干杯 No.

我坐在那等着药效开始 So I sat there waiting for the pill to kick in,
然后我开始好奇 And I started to wonder.
磕了药的Brian给我留的教学视频 Pill Brian is leaving instructions for me now.
听起来就像 It sounded like he thought
他在和另外一个人说话一样 he was talking to a different person,
我不喜欢这一点 And I don't like that.
我应该听他的话吗?

Rebecca有权知道他父亲去世的真相 Rebecca deserves to know the truth about her father.
当药效开始之后 But when the pill kicked in,
我看清了事情的方方面面 I did start to see all the angles.
他确实很有道理 And he had some good points.
喂 Brian?

Brian啊?

我们和你说话说了大概有30秒了 We've been talking to you for, like, 30 seconds,
你也在不停点头 不过看起来 and you're nodding your head, but it doesn't really
你一个字都没听进去 feel like you're listening.
抱歉 我在想别的事情 No.

好吧 我们重新说一遍 Okay, we'll repeat ourselves.
不用了 我是说 No need.

刚才我没有注意 但是我有超强的记忆力 paying attention in the moment, but, you know, perfect recall.
CJC和缉毒局合作 The CJC is working with Narcotics
调查一个开了冰毒实验室的帮派 但是...

大多数实验室都在郊区 most of the labs are upstate,
但是我们收到消息称 but we got a tip that there's one
有一个在下东城的住宅区里 in an L.

我们要带着 We're headed there
特种部队和缉毒局去那 with SWAT and narcotics,
但是你要和我们一起去 but you're coming along
操作雷电接口接收器 to work the thunderbolt bravo.
咱们要去下东城 We're going to the lower east side.
咱们要去找一个冰毒实验室 We're looking for a meth lab.
我还要去操作雷电接口接收器?

那是什么?

就是这个?

这是最先进的监视工具 This is state

自带纵横坐标测绘 with horizontal and vertical mapping.
我们可以定位所有的电话 无论有没有开机 We can ping any cell phone around here, on or off.
真不错 很明显你很会用这个机器 Cool.

你知道怎么操作这东西 那我在这干什么?

我们不知道要调查哪一个电话号码 We don't know which number we're looking for.
消息说实验室就在那个建筑里 The informant said the lab is in that building.
那有400个单元 可能有超过1000个手机 There are 400 units.

筛选数据你很在行 Sifting through data quickly is kind of your thing.
我们想知道有没有异常的电话号码 We want to know if one of those numbers stands out.
你说其它实验室都在郊区?

是的 Yes.
好的 Okay.
那么...

这里有三个手机号码是来自区号315的地方 There are three cell phones from area code 315 in there.
那是尤蒂卡的区号 That's Utica.
你怎么做到的?

号码还没有全部显示出来呢 The numbers haven't even finished aggregating.
还有个928的区号 There's a 928 area code, also,
亚利桑那州 精确一点 是尤马 Arizona.

我从这些数据里可以看出来 And I read in one of the informant's files
他曾经去过那里 that he used to travel
为那些毒贩子做事 up there when he worked for these dealers.
假如这个号码和尤蒂卡的号码联系过 So if that number crosses with a Utica number,
那么奇怪的是...

8号房 3R单元 House eight, unit 3

等等!

我们不知道里面回事什么情况 We don't know exactly what to expect in there,
但是特种部队永远都是对的 好吗?

这些蔓越莓果汁是你买的 So, do you have to pay for these cranberry juices,
还是联邦调查局出钱给你买的?

你最好还是少喝点 You may want to go easy on that.
监视的时候要控制住膀胱是个大问题 Bladder management's kind of a big thing in surveillance.
哈!

而且 我控制自身器官的能力无可挑剔 Plus, I have impeccable control over my bodily functions.
Brian的膀胱
内存空间不足 强制清空 你赢不了的!
好吧 我得去尿尿了 All right, I got to go.
不要跑进楼里去 Don't go in the building.
引爆线!

有人向他们透漏了风声 Someone must have tipped them off.
他们一定还没跑远 They couldn't have gotten far.
清扫整栋楼!

和街道都需要人力 in the stairwells and the streets.
快去!

- 别跑?

听着 我是联邦调查局的人 Listen, I'm with the FBI.
如果你是制毒的那伙人 最好别跑 If you're mixed up in the meth thing, it's better not to run,
- 我向你保证

听我说 别跑 老兄 Listen to me.

跑了 你就是逃犯 你的后果 Then you're a fugitive, and things will end
会非常的糟糕 really bad for you.
听着 我什么都没做 Look, I didn't do anything wrong.
那就好了 更有理由留下来了 That's great.

- 听着 我可以帮你

听着 你要是想阻止我 Look, if you're trying to stop me
又没有枪 你最好知道怎么打架 and you don't have a gun, you better know how to fight.
好吧 我倒是有超强的记忆力 Well, I do have perfect recall.
别跑!

控制住他 继续搜查 Get the restraints on him, we need to search
整栋楼余下的部分 the rest of the building.
我不明白 我把龙争虎斗看了不下十五遍了 I don't get it.

好吧 至少我把他拖住了一会儿 Yeah, well, at least I slowed him down for you guys.
不用谢 You're welcome.

翻译:

我不确定他耳鸣着还能不能听到我说话 Not sure he could hear me through the ringing in his ears,
但是 他不会有事的 你呢?

我没事 I'm fine.
有点生李小龙的气 但是我没事 Little pissed off at Bruce Lee right now, but i'm good.
下一次 也许你该控制一下 Next time, maybe you should monitor
少喝点蔓越莓果汁 your cranberry juice consumption.
就算这样 我们也不能让你 You know, that said, we can't have you running
没有得到培训就跑进那栋楼 out of the building without proper training,
所以我要给你上节特种部队自卫课程 so I'm gonna have you run a SWAT self

Rooks 你可以带他见见世面 Rooks, you can get him up to speed on that.
那么我们在下东城 And what about the kid we brought in
抓获的那个孩子怎么说?

他叫Christopher Garper 二十岁 His name is Christopher Garper.

没有前科 No priors.
他说自己从来没有进去过那个公寓 He claims that he never went into the apartment,
他是跟着自己的哥哥进了那栋楼 that he just followed his brother into the building,
监控录像也证实了他的说法 and security footage confirms his story.
那是Chris Garper的哥哥 Sam That's Chris Garper's brother, Sam,
和Norris Allen一起进楼的录像 walking in with Norris Allen,
我们突袭单元的居住者 the occupant of the unit we raided.
这是在我们到达前的20分钟的录像 This is about 20 minutes before we got there.
他们来自尤马和尤蒂卡的客人几分钟后也来了 Their guests from Yuma and Utica arrive a couple minutes
紧随Garper和Allen之后 after Garper and Allen.
最后一个 Chris Garper And last of all, Chris Garper.
说回到那个居住者Norris Alle Getting back to the occupant, Norris Allen.
我查看了他的犯罪记录 I looked into his criminal records.
对 他曾因纵火罪被逮捕 Yeah, he did time for arson,
而且在他坐牢的期间 and he joined up with the sons
和Nathan Bedford Forrest的儿子们混在了一起 of Nathan Bedford Forrest when he was in jail.
他还因为从警卫那里偷窃材料 He was also thrown into solitary for rigging up a bomb
来制造弹药而被关到禁闭室 with stuff he stole from a janitor.
Nathan Bedford Forrest的儿子们 The sons of Nathan Bedford Forrest
称他们自己为民兵 call themselves a militia.
这些人可不是毒贩 These are not drug dealers.
我们认为这不是一场毒品交易 We don't think this is a drug deal.
用来合成冰毒的 Chemicals used
化学物质同样能用来 to synthesize meth can also be used
制造炸药 to make explosives.
他们打算在纽约搞破坏 They're planning on something in New York.
他们在聊天中把纽约比作 They refer to our city
所多玛 即罪恶之地 所以有这个可能 as "sodom" on their chat boards, so yeah.
我正在联系反恐指挥部 I'm looping in the counterterror SAC
这样就能知道最近有什么动向了 so we can check any recent chatter.
那个被拘留的孩子是怎么说的?

他有透露什么吗?

目前为止什么也没说 他不肯和我们交流 So far, nothing.

他不肯和我或Boyle聊 He won't talk to me or Boyle.
他只要求说要见一个人 There's only one person he asked to see.
你的脸还好吧?

还不错 Pretty much.
你不是第一次揍人了吧?

只有必要的时候我才会动手 Just when I need to.
你为什么想要见我?

为了向你道歉 To apologize.
抱歉 Sorry.
什么 你以为这样就没事了吗?

我也不知道 I don't know.
我觉得你是个不错的家伙 I thought you seemed cool.
或许是我错了 Guess I was wrong.
听着 跟他们说了 我企图逃跑只是因为吓尿了 Look, I told them, I only ran because I freaked out.
对于此事我毫不知情 I got nothing to do with this.
我来就是想弄清楚这事 Well, that's what I'm here to figure out.
他们说如果不想在这浪费时间 They say if I don't want to do a bunch of time,
就把我哥哥的事全都告诉他们 I have to tell them all about my brother.
那你准备怎么做?

我不知道能告诉你什么 I don't even know what I can tell you.
我不知道Sam在哪儿 I have no idea where Sam is.
可我知道他不是一个恐怖分子 But I know that he's not a terrorist.
他在网络上 He goes on web sites,
抨击政府 pops off about the government.
可是他没有做什么坏事 That's all just noise.
你跟着他进入大楼是有原因的 Chris Well, you followed him into that building for a reason, Chris.
你一定是觉得他企图做些什么 You must think he's up to something.
Sam是不会杀人的 Sam wouldn't kill people.
好吗?

自从我十六岁 他就一直照顾我 He's been watching out for me since I was 16.
那你的父母呢?

如果我跟你说了 我希望你能帮他 If I talk to you, I want you to help him
就像你们说会帮我一样 the same way you guys said you'd help me.
只是我觉得 Only I don't think
我也提供不了什么有用信息 that I know anything that's gonna help you.
那可说不准 You might know more than you think you do.
和我说说他吧 Tell me about him.
怎么说 就是普通的闲聊吗?

他叫Sam I mean, he's Sam.
你知道吗?

大家都认为他又高又壮...

我相信Sam是无辜的吗?

我只相信Chris认为Sam是无辜的 Well, I believe Chris believed it.
他们是兄弟 会做兄弟间做的事 They were brothers.

我有两个哥哥 I got two older brothers.
身为最小的弟弟 在一个大家庭里长大 Youngest brother, growing up in a big family.
总是备受欺凌 It's not a good spot to be.
从各个方面来说 确实如此 I mean, I could relate, to a point.
- 特别是当我妈妈过世以后

Chris告诉我 癌症带走他们母亲的经过 Chris told me how he and Sam lost their mom to cancer,
还有父亲因此大受打击 成为了酒鬼 and how her death drove their dad to drink.
是我的哥哥在最艰难的时候...

接着他们也失去了他 Which led to them losing him, too.
一点也不好 It was bad.
我们聊完以后 By the time we were done,
我对Sam Garper了如指掌 I was an expert in Sam Garper.
嘿 那个家伙...

我们搜查了他的公寓 whose apartment we raided,
也就是Norris Allen 我们把他的照片 Norris Allen, we've got his picture out
传给了市里的每一个警员 to everyone who carries a badge in this city.
反恐行动组织在奈森之子的 And, uh, counterterror has someone undercover
帮派里有个卧底 with ties to the group.
所以我们可以静待看看能否 Sons of Nathan, so we'll see what they can pick up
知道他们的计划 about the plan.
了不起 Amazing.
你是有线索了吧 You've been up to something.
对 今天我和Chris Garper聊了三个小时 Yeah, I talked to Chris Garper about his brother
他哥哥的事 for, like, three hours today.
我知道Sam的一切嗜好 I got everything Sam was into,
从潜水侠到齐柏林飞艇 from Aquaman to Zeppelin.
真不错 Well, it's pretty.
多谢夸奖 Thank you.
Chris还告诉我他哥有一个秘密邮箱 You know, Chris also told me that he knows his brother has
连Chris都不曾告诉 an e

他撞见Sam好几次都匆忙把它关掉 He saw Sam closing out of it in a hurry a few different times.
如果Sam和仇恨组织联系 毋庸置疑 If Sam is communicating with a hate group, stands to reason
他用的就是这个秘密账户 he's using the secret account.
我猜用户名和密码 I figure the user name and password
是...

像这样 注册于主要的免费电子邮箱网站之一 of this, at one of the major free e

潜在的邮箱用户名真不少 That's quite a few possible e

目前为止 大约有两万多个 Just north of 20,000 so far.
不过我NZT的药效快没了 But i'm running out of NZT,
所以我把剩下的数据交给别人弄了 so I'm outsourcing the rest to cyber,
他们可能要弄一整夜 and they'll run possibilities all night.
够呛!

等下 Oh, hey.
你说过你不久前去画廊 You had mentioned you stopped by that gallery
看过你父亲的画 to see your dad's paintings the other night?
对 Yeah.
那...

有没有觉得有些...

释然?

事实上 它让我更加好奇了 Actually, it made me curious.
不知道为何 我一直认为 I don't know why, but I always assumed
他只有在来见我的那次 that he'd only used NZT the one time
服用了NZT 直到...

亲眼目睹了那些画...

它们太不可思议了 They're incredible.
它们触动了我 我...

有些时候 我会觉得就算 There was a part of me that was thinking I'd be okay
不知道他到底发生了什么也没事 never knowing what happened to him.
但...

所以...

晚安 Good night.
晚安 Yeah.
好 我们还是问了Rebecca Okay, so we went ahead
关于她父亲的事 and asked Rebecca about her dad.
本意是好的 The intentions were good.
我希望你知道她已经放下了 I wanted you to know that she had moved on.
而结果?

并不怎么好 Not so good.
鉴于你现在没有服用NZT So, since you're not on NZT, and you're therefore subject
因此对任何事都过于主观 感情用事 to all kinds of unruly, emotionally driven altruism,
我想这个饼状图帮的上忙 I thought a pie chart might help.
死法:

当然 我知道这张图完全忽略了 Now, I do recognize that this leaves out the possibility
坐牢的可能性 可是...

这个饼图旨在告诉你 坐牢和死没什么两样 for purposes of this chart, supermax equals death.
你们这些人都不会敲门吗?

我是来带你去训练的 I'm supposed to take you to training.
服了NZT的我 I can be really annoying
有够讨人嫌 when I'm on NZT.
我们深有体会 We've noticed.
你知道有个酷炫小子刚上初中 Okay, you know that cool kid in junior high school
就已经黑带三段了吗?

当然 不是我 No, not me.
是他 我总是感觉那家伙长大后会成为Casey Rooks那样的人 Him.

如果有谁能让我变得身手不凡 就是他了 And if anyone can make me a badass, it's him.
别打架 Don't get into a fight.
好的 Okay.
如果发生斗殴行为 If you do get into a fight,
你就把人压倒在地上 take it to the ground, get on top of the guy,
压制住他的一只手或脚 把它往反方向折 isolate one of his limbs, and make it bend the wrong way
- 直到他哭着求饶

或者...

哇 知道了 Wow.

我刚刚告诉你的那些 What I just told you takes about ten years
你要练个十年才能做得好 to learn how to do well.
不过只要你有所掌握 But if you know even a little,
防身就没有问题了 对吗?

来练习吧 Come on, now.
他向我展示了人体 He explained that the human body
一系列禁打及不禁打的地方 is a series of strong and weak points.
你可以攻击手肘 You can go after an elbow,
膝盖还有脚踝 a knee, an ankle.
不论如何 理论上都说得通 And it all made sense in theory anyway.
如果李小龙有教会我什么 And if Bruce Lee taught me anything,
那就是我应该忘掉他教的一切 it's that I needed to unlearn everything.
有什么比服用了NZT感觉更美妙的吗?

如果我能控制你视线的方向 If I can control which way you're looking,
就能控制你的整个身体 I control your whole body.
对 Right.
- 你能让开了吗?

两位 Guys?
- 我需要用下Brian

你有段时间没有下场训练了 You haven't been out on the mats in a while.
嘿 你来这儿一点都没有自命不凡 Hey, you came here with no ego.
做得很棒 You did a good job.
我们每周练两个早上 可以吗?

可以 All right.
感觉如何?

学到了什么意料之外的东西吗?

那个...

听我说 那些你给的邮箱名 You know, the e

他们搜索后找到了一个匹配邮箱名 Well, they ran them, and they found one account.
里面完全是空的 只要一个草稿文件 That was totally empty, except for a drafts folder.
我们就在里面找到了这些 That's where we found these.
猫咪 飞船 还有杰克·布莱克(演员) So, what do a cat, a spaceship
与恐怖行动有什么关联?

那个是Paul Revere That's Paul Revere.
恐怖组织已经懂得 And terrorist groups have been known
把信息加密到数据文件里了 to encrypt information into data files.
这是基本的速记式加密 It's basic steganography.
我们认为Sam Garper把他的账户 We think Sam Garper is sharing his account
共享给其他人 而那个人应该就是Norris Allen with another user, presumably Norris Allen,
他们用草稿文件 and they're using the drafts folder
来躲避追查 to avoid a trail.
这是Allen的地址 已经搜查过了 Allen's address, where the raid was.
- 卡兰特街300号?

11月20号 离现在还有两天 November 20 that's two days from now.
1214号门罗街 皇后区的?

那是一家医院 It's a hospital.
我已经吩咐保安 I'll tell security
留心任何可疑人物了 to keep an eye out for anything suspicious,
不过一直很正常 But it's been quiet.
我们可以检查一下 Can we check if any patients
符合这些特征 并且是在48小时内 matching these descriptions have been admitted
被收进来的人吗?

- 当然可以

你认为这里就是目标?

有可能 Maybe.
现在说不准 Can't assume anything.
你在找什么?

能给我们一份进出这间库房的 Can we get a list of everyone
人员名单吗?

可以 我们每周都有根据联邦法规 Sure.

来更换密码的 per federal regulations.
号码是827351235吗?

那就写在门框上 如果我要记住一个 It's written on the doorjamb.

九位数字的密码 我也会这么干的 a nine

- 介意我试试吗?

用于治疗癌症的药物能够 The chemicals used in cancer treatment
将一个炸弹变成RDD 这正是 can transform a bomb into RDD, which is exactly
这些房间一定要上锁的原因 why rooms like this have to be secured.
有什么问题吗?

封条破了 The seal is broken.
里面空了 It's empty.
RDD是什么?

放射性武器 Radiological dispersion device.
看起来Sam Garper这是准备制造脏弹 Looks like Sam Garper's building a dirty bomb.
根据医院的监控录像显示 The hospital's security footage
Sam Garper在36个小时之前曾出现在医院的 puts Sam Garper in the radiology wing
放射科区域 36 hours ago.
根据圣心医院统计 According to Sacred Heart,
他们丢失了5个单位的铱

这些和他们手上的那些易爆物结合起来 Combine that with the explosive chems they've already got,
将会造成一个相当范围的放射性污染带 we're looking at a sizeable contamination zone.
这个工作最糟糕的部分就是总能听到那些 The worst part of this job is learning about things
你从未想过自己需要担忧的事情 you never knew you needed to worry about.
比如 大规模杀伤性武器 For instance, weapons of mass disruption.
听起来像个很烂的乐队名 Sounds like a really bad band name.
这些老大口中的放射性武器就是之一 It's what my bosses call RDDs.
如今 我们都知道辐射的危害 Now, we all know radiation is bad,
但是在放射性武器面前 辐射问题还真不是问题的关键 but with an RDD, the poisoning is almost besides the point.
关键是它能引起的恐慌 The point is the panic.
人们涌进医院 交通瘫痪 People flood the hospitals, transportation shuts down,
所有商店都关门 businesses close.
等到我们完成对受冲击地区的净化时 By the time the blast site is decontaminated,
城市的经济早就崩溃了 the city's economy is destroyed.
所有的基础公共设施都毁了 The whole infrastructure falls apart.
Brain 你在听我说话吗?

嘿 Brian!

没听 不好意思 怎么了?

我需要你去和Chris Garper谈谈 I want you to go talk to Chris Garper.
他肯定对他哥哥特别失望 He must be upset about his brother.
你是说他可能是恐怖分子的事情吗?

他弟弟还不知道这事呢 He doesn't know yet.
你想让我去告诉他 You want me to tell him.
- 我和你一起去

Finch已经得到了那孩子的信任 Finch has already won the kid's trust.
如果Chris Garper在他哥哥的事上 If there's anything Chris Garper hasn't told us
还有所隐瞒 那么你一个人去的话 about his brother, there's a better chance he'll crack
- 他更可能崩溃坦白

听着 那个孩子已经承受了很大的压力了 Look, the kid is already gonna be so crushed.
Sam才是我担心的那个孩子 Sam's the kid I care about.
他才是带着炸弹的那个 The one with the bomb.
去吧 Go.
那是你哥哥 That's your brother.
他偷了一些放射性化学原料 He's stealing radioactive chemicals.
我知道 你觉得他不是那样的人 Now, I know you thought he was someone different,
但是你哥哥正在计划一场屠杀 but your brother's planning to kill people.
大屠杀 A lot of them.
不对 这是...

这什么都说明不了 This doesn't tell me anything.
你还记得你告诉我们的那个Sam的电子邮箱吗?

这些是在他的草稿里发现的一些信息 These are some of the messages that were in his drafts folder,
这些信息显示了这个组织是怎么一步一步拉他入伙 and they show how that group slowly recruited him
让他做这件事 into doing this.
但问题是他已经做了 But he is doing this.
我不想这么说 但是这是一场恐怖袭击 I'm sorry to put it this way, but it's a terrorist attack.
看看这些邮件吧 Chris Read the e

从我们开始的谈话中看得出来 You thought Sam was a different kind of guy
你觉得Sam不是这种人 when we started talking.
所以...

也许你知道怎么阻止这件事情的发生 Maybe you know a way to stop this from happening.
我甚至都不了解我自己的哥哥 哥们 I don't even know my own brother, man.
你还指望我能告诉你什么?

听着 如果你想不起来 那就别想了 Look, if there's nothing, there's nothing.
Chris 我相信你说的话 Chris, I believe you.
他们计划的那件事情 Whatever they're planning,
我们认为在两天内就要发生了 we think it's happening in about two days.
所以如果你突然想起什么 想和我谈谈 So if you do remember something and you want to talk,
就来找我 I'll be here.
- Brian...

Naz想让我怎么做 折磨他?

他什么都不知道 He doesn't know anything.
我了解 我都看到了 I know.

我担心的是你 I'm checking on you.
好吧 我的确是才告诉那个孩子 Well, I just told that guy that his brother
他哥哥是一个很有创意的杀人狂 is an aspiring mass murderer.
我甚至听到他心碎的声音了 Practically heard his heart snap.
我看到了 I saw.
Chris已经知道事情的真相了 Chris knows the truth now.
这也许很难接受 但是...

对吗?

等等 Rebecca Hey, Rebecca.
没事了 Never mind.
明天见 See you tomorrow.
那个嗑药的Brain不让我告诉Rebecca So pill

NZT文件的真相 没关系 about the NZT file.

他可从来没说过我不能自己探个究竟 He never said I can't dig into it on my own.
你最好不是又闯进我家了 You better not have broken into my place again.
你给过我钥匙了 Um, you gave me a key,
记得吗?

你以为我是谁?

经常有人闯进来吗?

不说那个了 Don't worry about it.
嗯 Hmm.
我带了点好酒来 I got the good stuff.
不行 我要随时准备出动 万一Sam Garper的案子 I've got to be ready to go in, in case something breaks
又有什么突破了 on the Sam Garper case.
今天的训练怎么样?

就第一次训练来说 他做得还不错 First time.

他没问起我们俩的关系吧?

他为什么要问?

我也不清楚 但是他挺敏锐的 I don't know.

我不想让他知道我们在一起的事情 I wouldn't want him to figure out that we're dating.
这个小子到底什么情况?

他...

我们都知道有些事情是需要保密的 所以...

就让它去好了 Let's just leave it at that.
好的 我很愿意把工作放在一边 Yeah.

但是如果Finch真问起我俩的关系 but what do you want me to say
你希望我怎么解释?

我们得回避这个问题 Well, we have to dodge it.
我们还没签人事调动申请呢 We haven't signed the HR forms yet.
是啊 我们的感情还没到那个地步呢 Right.

我们能不讨论这些问题了吗?

好 马上收住 Yeah.

问个问题 Quick question.
为什么在你的咖啡桌上有个我的人型黏土雕像?

你的?

那是查尔斯·巴克利(爵士队著名前锋) That's Charles Barkley.
我和你说过要买好一点的威士忌 I told you to get some good scotch.
没错 但那已经是他们那里最贵的一瓶了 Yeah, well, that was the most expensive bottle they had.
你在酒窖里怎么可能找到好威士忌 You can't get your single malt at the bodega.
我给你的那个电话号码 是应急时候用的 That phone number I gave you, it's for emergencies.
你和Edward Morra You and Edward Morra.
你们两个对NZT的了解多过联邦调查局那些人 对吗?

然后 那些我帮你偷来的文档 So, those files I stole for you,
里面有些我想要多了解的东西 there's something in there that I want to learn more about.
我在联邦调查局里是在Rebecca Harris手下工作 The woman I work with at the FBI is Rebecca Harris.
他们有一份有关她父亲的档案 They have a file on her father.
他也在服用NZT He was using NZT,
然后就被谋杀了 and then he got murdered.
你什么都没和她说 对吧?

没有 当然没有 No, of course not.
但是如果我能查出她父亲出了什么事 But if I can find out what happened to him,
也许我能想出一个办法告诉他 maybe there's a way I can let her know
还能不让她知晓这些档案的内容 without telling her what's in the files.
听着 如果你知道些什么 Look, if you know anything,
告诉我吧 just tell me.
你有什么可在意的?

关于Rebecca Harris的父亲?

一点都不在意 I don't.
而你也不应该在意 And neither should you.
这女人让你分心了吗?

什么?

不是 No.
我们需要把你重新安排 Are we going to have to arrange for you
去和别的人共事吗?

不需要 No.
不是你想的那样 It's not like that.
我什么都没和她说 I haven't talked to her about anything.
即便如此 我们也不能允许这种奇怪的归属感 Even so, we can't have some misguided loyalty
对你在联邦调查局的真正任务产生影响 distracting you from the real reason you're at the FBI.
没影响 我们没什么 It's not.

我和Rebecca真没什么 Rebecca and I are fine.
你把我今天的话忘了吧 Forget I said anything.
Morra先生和我不可能监视每一个 Mr.

从他手上领取NZT的瘾君子 who manages to get his hands on NZT.
在你把档案交到我手上之前 I never heard of Conrad Harris
我从来没听过Conrad Harris这个名字 until you put that file in my hand.
谨慎使用那个号码 好吗?

顺便问一句 你爸爸怎么样了?

他顺利出院了吗?

也许我是对的 Maybe I was right.
我是说嗑药Brain是对的 I mean, maybe pill

那就是我们是对的?

我试着帮助Rebecca I tried to help Rebecca,
差点让我们连继续合作的机会都没了 and instead I almost got us split up.
别再做老好人先生了 No more Mr.

我要变成恶人Brain I have to be badass Brian.
恶人Brain会独守秘密 Badass Brian keeps his secrets private.
恶人Brain只顾着他自己 Badass Brian looks out for himself.
等这一切过去了 恶人Brain And when all this is over, badass Brian
就拍拍屁股走人 自由地活着 gets out of this free and alive.
Chris 你来这里干嘛?

我有事情要告诉你 哥们 I got to talk to you, man.
他一个小时之前给我打了电话 About an hour ago, he called me.
Sam给我打了电话 Sam called me.
我觉得我知道他在哪了 I think I know where he is.
Sam把这个包藏在我们住的地方了 Sam had this bag stashed at our place.
他想让我带着它 然后等他电话 He wanted me to grab it, then wait for his call.
他说这里面装着他的钱 He said he's got money in it,
无论这里面装的是什么 And whatever the hell that stuff is.
我读了他正在制造的 I read about that thing
东西的资料 上面说拿东西对制造 that he's building, and it says that the people
和引爆它的人造成的伤害 who put it together and who set it off,
远大于其他受害者 that they get worse poison than anybody.
我是说 他会死的 I mean, he's gonna die.
Sam想要杀死很多人 然后他自己也会死 Sam's gonna kill a bunch of people, and he's gonna die.
我哥哥这是怎么了?

他为什么要这么做?

我不知道 Chris I don't know, Chris.
我一直认为加入这类组织的人 I think usually people that join groups like that,
都是出于某些目的的 they're looking for some kind of purpose.
我觉得是我害他这么做的 你明白吗?

什么意思?

Sam退学是为了让我 Sam dropped out so I could
能够上学 go to school.
我拿到了文凭 而他得到了...

听着 我知道你其实很明白 Look, I know you already know this,
无论Sam为你做了什么 but whatever Sam did for you,
都不能为他今天要做的事情开脱 it doesn't make what he's doing now okay.
你知道吗 如果我接了那个电话 You understand, I take that call,
然后让你们跟踪我 let you guys follow me,
我是在出卖自己的哥哥 I'm turning in my brother.
你也有兄弟 You got brothers.
你会怎么想?

我难以想象 Can't even imagine.
听着 我需要知道你愿意为Sam做些什么 Look, I need to know what you can do for Sam.
他的确做了很坏的事情 他要进监狱的 He's done bad things.

但是他还不是一个恐怖分子 But he's not a terrorist yet.
有什么项目可以让他加入吗?

也许能让他在监狱里拿到个学位 Maybe he can get his diploma while he does time.
我不觉得有这样的项目 但是我会问问看 I don't think so, but I'll check.
他到底想要我们干什么?

这我不知道 但我知道 I don't know.

我们这是让他揭发自己的亲生哥哥 that we're asking him to turn in his own brother.
我们应该拿出点诚意 So there has to be something we can give.
你知道Sam Garper想要背包里的什么东西吗?

是铍粉 Beryllium powder.
他要用它来完成炸弹 He needs it to finish the bomb he's building
然后把这座城市炸得寸草不生 that will render some chunk of this city uninhabitable.
有人会因此得病 甚至丧命 People will die, others will get sick,
而这一切都是仇恨和无政府主义造成的 and it will all be to advance the cause of hate and nihilism.
没有管教所能教育好 There are no reform schools for people planning
像Sam Garper那样的人 what Sam Garper is planning.
那些企图炸伤我手下的人 There's no second chance for people who rig trip wires
是不可原谅的 to kill my agents.
不知道Christ对此作何感想 I don't know how Chris will react to that.
他没有机会发表感想 Well, we can't give him the chance to react to it.
你让我对他说谎 So you want me to lie to him.
他必须要和他哥见面 He has to get to that meeting with his brother,
你好好想想 and I want you to think about
如果他不去会有什么后果 what will happen if he doesn't.
必要的话 你可以把这当成一道数学题 You can think of it as a math problem if you have to.
但是你见到Chris Garper时 However you get there,
必须跟他说他想听到的那些话 you have to tell Chris Garper what he needs to hear.
好吧 Okay.
如果一定得这么做 我想先来一颗药丸 If I have to do this, I want my pill first.
吃了NZT 我更擅长解题 I'm better at crunching numbers when I'm on NZT.
敬我即将成为的坏人 To the benefits of being a badass.
嘿 哥们 Hey, bud.
你有什么发现吗?

你能帮Sam吗?

说实话 As a matter of fact,
我们可以帮Sam we can help Sam.
我完成任务了吗?

我把联邦监狱说的跟在加州度假一样 I made federal prison sound like a California vacation.
我把Mike和Ike想象成狱警 In my head, I made Mike and Ike the prison guards.
你懂我意思的 You get the metaphor.
反正犯人们都过得很开心 Anyway, they were all gonna have so much fun.
Sam不仅可以拿到高中文凭 And Sam wasn't just gonna get a high school diploma,
还会有个光明的未来 he was being set up for a life of success.
我是不是编得过火了?

也许吧 Maybe.
不管我说了什么 怎么胡编乱造 But whatever I had to say, whatever lies I had to tell,
都跟真的似的 they worked.
他相信了 He believed me.
Chris刚才接到电话 Chris just got the call Sam wants him
Sam让他下午四点到东河公园拿包 to pass the bag off at east river park, 4:

好的 Cool.
你没事吧?

我曾经也操纵过线人...

以为好好洗个热水澡就好了 you want to take a silkwood shower when it's done,
但其实不然 but it does get easier.
现在操纵线人很轻松了?

那你的顾问呢?

那是两码事 我以为你懂的 That's different.

嗯 我明白 Oh, yeah, I get it.
都是演戏 It's all in the game.
你没看过那节目?

Chris直到六点才会交出包 Chris wasn't handing the bag off until 6:

所以我先去和Casey训练了 so I went straight into my training session with Casey.
但这次训练与以往不同 But this time would be different.
我知道Casey一定没想到 I'm sure Casey wasn't expecting me
我这么快就是扳倒他 还以为我一辈子做不到 to get the upper hand that fast, or even at all.
但我知道他会全力反抗 But I knew he would try after that.
竭尽全力 I mean, really try.
有时他占上风 有时是我 He got me a bunch of times, I got him a few times.
但重要的是 我知道卷入战斗 But it was pretty clear I'd know what to do
该如何应对 if I got in another fight.
好了...

你为什么要骗大家?

很明显你以前练过 I mean, you've obviously trained before.
没人能在一天学会这么多技巧 No one learns that much technique in a day.
我学东西快 I'm a quick study.
我们的人会等到你离开你哥 Our people aren't gonna move in
他们再过去实施抓捕 until you walk away from your brother.
现在我们希望一切顺利 Now, we expect everything's gonna be
我们需要你熟悉抓捕过程 just fine, but we want you clear of the arrest
也是为了你的安全 for your own safety.
尽量不要和Sam过多交谈 Try not to spend too much time talking to Sam.
把包给他 然后赶紧走 Just give him the bag and say good

好了 All right.
那孩子在等着 Kid's there waiting.
隧道正常 Tunnel is secure.
南边小路也没情况 Good by the south pathway.
我们密切注视着 We got it surrounded.
隧道走来了两个人 You've got two people coming from the tunnel.
是Sam Garper That's Sam Garper.
还有个人和他一起 He's got his buddy with him.
是Norris Allen 他来做什么?

可以一石二鸟啊 Two

Sam啊 Sam.
嘿 兄弟 Hey, bud.
你看起来很糟啊 You look awful, man.
看来你找到了我的包 Looks like you found my bag.
听着 孩子...

一切都会好起来的 明白吗?

我会回家的 I'm gonna be back home, you know.
说不准什么时候...

我们会再见的 好吧?

你为什么要这么做?

做什么?

他在干嘛?

对不起 Hey, I'm sorry.
但这是 This is gonna be
为你好 a good thing.
他带警察来了 我们赶紧走 He brought the cops.

Sam 别跑!

别跑!

停下来!

快去 快去 Move, move, move.
Sam啊!

嘿!

- 我出去

去左边!

谁看着Norris Allen呢?

趴下 Stay down.
搞定了?

嗯 Yeah.
Allen怎么办?

不准动!

Sam Garper被拷上了 Norris Allen后背中了两枪 We've got Sam Garper in cuffs.

他朝Chris开了一枪 pulled a gun on Chris.
- 谁开的枪?

- 天啊

Allen那枪打中了 Uh, Allen did get a shot off.
救护车呢?

有事给你打电话 I'll call you if we need anything.
谢谢 Thank you.
刚接到Bellevue的电话 We just got a call from Bellevue.
Chris Garper静脉中枪 Chris Garper was in hydrostatic shock
他们把他抬上了救护车 when they loaded him into the ambulance.
给他做了手术 但他...

失血过多 there was too much hemorrhaging.
没有挺过去 He didn't make it.
抱歉 I'm sorry.
我跟他说了那些 So I told him whatever he needed to hear
骗他去会面 to get him to that meeting, and...
但却害他丢了性命 he got killed.
我明白你的感受 I understand how you're feeling.
很难受 It's awful.
他哥哥Sam没事 His brother Sam is gonna be okay.
只有一点放射灼伤 His radiation burns were the worst of his injuries.
我们今天阻止了一颗炸弹的爆炸 There's a bomb that won't go off because of what we did today.
救了很多人 You saved lives.
嗯 但没能救他 Yep.

一定有两全的办法 只是我没想到 There had to be way to do both;

就算吃了NZT not even on NZT.
这是这份工作的负面 Brian This is the worst part of what we do, Brian.
蒙骗线人 Working a C.

那时真的是千钧一发 It's really complicated really fast.
我们竭力避免 但有时...

对这个案子...

对世界好的结果 未必 what's best for the world, turns out to be
对某个人也是好的 a very different thing than what's best for the person.
我们就这么自我安慰的?

欺骗自己的良知...

区别对待事物 Draw boundaries, compartmentalize
就像你和Casey那样 like you and Casey.
什么?

你说操纵别人 欺骗别人 You say it gets easier to manipulate people,
越来越容易 to lie.
你们怎么会有真感情?

不好意思...

你怎么知道Casey和我的事?

你身上有他的古龙水味 His cologne, it lingers on you.
还有Naz建议他培训我时 你的反应 Your reaction when Naz suggested he train me.
他每天早上都去你桌子那里 The way he shows up at your desk every morning.
好了 我知道了 Okay, thank you, I get it.
我说骗人更容易 Okay, so when I said it gets easier to lie,
其实是骗你的 that was a lie.
但你总得找到一种解决的方法 But you find a way to live with it.
我顺路送你?

我想自己走回去 No, I could use the walk.
嘿 你要回家?

嗯 你呢?

也行吧 Oh, maybe.
你还好吧?

嗯 Yeah.
Finch是个怪人 Our guy Finch is a wreck.
不好意思 但我得问问 I'm sorry, I got to ask.
你们对他做了什么?

你还记得你刚开始受训时吗?

你用了至少两周 It took you at least two weeks
才学会控制呼吸 just get a handle on the breathing.
- 你说我很有天赋的

但Brian已经在学锁关节和掐人了 Brian he's already doing joint locks and chokes
而我直到第五年才开始学这些 that I didn't learn till my fifth year on the mat.
就好像他能一目十行 一日千里 It's like he absorbed a decade's worth of technique in a night.
或者是他隐瞒了以前受过训练 So either he's hiding the fact that he had training,
或者是其它什么原因 or there's something else going on.
他学东西快 He's a fast learner.
大家都这么说 Mm.

嗯 他也看出了我们的关系 Yeah.

看来我们应该签人事调动文件了 Oh.

不 No.
我相信他 I trust him.
晚安 Casey Good night, Casey.
晚安 Rebecca Night, Rebecca.
如果你正看着我 If you're watching this,
那说明你是吃了药的我 that means you're me, me on the pill.
你总是告诉我该怎么做 Guy who's been telling me what to do.
我知道你记得这些 And I know you remember all this,
但我还是要说 but I'm gonna say it anyway.
虽然你记得这些事 Just because you remember everything
但你并不了解所有事情 doesn't mean you know everything.
我们不能主宰一切 We are not omniscient,
或者说今天的结局可能会截然不同 or today would have gone very differently.
如果把自己放在首位 And if putting myself first
意味着就算牺牲掉Chris Garper也没关系 means being okay with what happened to Chris Garper,
那我退出 then I'm not playing.
你跟我说 想要活下去就要不择手段 You tell me I've got to be ruthless to survive.
但如果这其中包括不再做自己 But if that means killing the part of myself
才能活下去 that makes being alive worthwhile,
就像现在这样 that is not how I'm getting through this.
我不希望像这样活着 That isn't how we're getting through this.
看着办吧 So deal with it.
你没得选择 You don't have a choice, really,
因为我下次吃药的时候 because by the time I take my next pill,
事情已经无法挽回了 the damage is already going to be done.
你没事吧?

我复制了这份档案 I made a copy of this file.
你别管我是怎么弄到的 I can't tell you exactly how I got it,
但我真的认为你该看看其中的内容 but I do think you should know what's inside.
你理应知道里面的内容 You deserve to know what's inside.
事关你父亲 Rebecca It's about your father, Rebecca.
我能进去吗?

请进 Yeah.
