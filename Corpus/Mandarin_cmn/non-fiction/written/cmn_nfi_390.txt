他在摩托车后座上没下来 He stayed back on the bike.

我希望我没让她难过 我本意并非如此 Oh, I hope I didn't upset her.

我觉得她没太理解你告诉她的事 I think she didn't quite know what to make of what you told her.
当中绝大部分都很模棱两可 A lot of it wasn't very specific.
我也希望能告诉她更多事 Like, I wish I could've said more.

我听到的声音不是幻听 The voices I hear are different.
你该明白这点 You should get that, I'd think.
-有些事是与灵魂相关的

那你为什么给我这张名片 Then why did you give me the card?

你的摩托车后座上 a couple of weeks ago.
你当时正在为你的女朋友买毒品 You were on your way to buy drugs for your girlfriend,

你的卖家看到你...

他不是我的卖家 He's not my dealer.
在他家外面冲着丹尼嚷嚷 Outside his house yelling at Danny.
我没有嚷他 I wasn't yelling at him.
这可不像不熟的人之间会干的事啊 That doesn't sound like someone you hardly knew.
丹尼很孤独 Danny was a lonely kid, all right?

我想着过会儿再送他回家 I figured I'd take him home later.
这样对他比较安全 He'd be safer that way.
你们在温斯蒂德是为什么吵架 What were you arguing about in Winstead?
我在路边的车站加油 I stopped for gas at the station up the road,
我进去付钱时 and when I went in to pay...
丹尼也跟进来了 Danny followed me in.
当我们在米奇家下车时 And then when we got off the bike at Mickey's,
我发现他手上拿着本新的填字游戏书 I saw he had this new crossword book
好像还有枚纪念别针 and, like

他说他顺手拿的 一副自豪的样子 He said he swiped it like he was proud.
我告诉他不能这么做 不能偷东西 I was telling him not to do that, not to steal stuff.
你自个儿在买毒品时 Teaching him the eighth commandment

他就让我住在隔壁 as long as I work three shifts a week.
我上下班都打了卡的 I clocked in.

去查吧 Go check.
他看到我把警察招来估计会气疯了 And he'll probably freak out on me for bringing the cops around,
说不定要把我扫地出门了 maybe even kick me out,
不过你也不在乎吧 But what do you care?
我去找他叔叔 你去加油站 I'll take the uncle.

看看有没有人记得他们 See if anyone remembers them.
还要看有没有监控录像 See if they have cameras.
长官 之前怎么了 Sir, what happened earlier?
-什么

米勒警探 Detective Miller?
怎么了 Yes.
贝丝·索拉诺已经坐这等了一小时了 Beth Solano

我在这儿等的时候你们是在和他谈话吗 Were you talking to him while I was sitting here?
不 我们不是在跟他谈话 No, we weren't talking to him.
那你们在和谁谈话 Well, who were you talking to?
你要不进来吧 咱们可以单独聊聊 Why don't you come in here?

对不起 贝丝 I'm sorry, Beth.
我无权向你透露 I'm not at liberty to say.
你还为什么事感到抱歉 艾莉 What else are you sorry for, Ellie?
你是不是还要为没告诉我们 Are you sorry you haven't told us
这三天里发生的事而道歉 what's going on in three days?
你是不是还要为没告诉我们 Are you sorry you haven't told us
这家伙是谁而道歉 who the hell this person is?
为什么你要向每个人打听他 Why you're asking everyone about him,
却唯独不找我 everyone except me?
我让皮特给你和马克看他的照片了 I told Pete to show you and Mark his picture.
我不要皮特给我们看照片 艾莉 I don't want Pete to show us the picture, Ellie.
我不想跟皮特说话 I don't want to talk to Pete.
我想跟你说 可你躲着我们 I want to talk to you, but you avoid us.

然后我告诉他现在是淡季 and I

他还说了别的吗 Did he say anything else?
他很奇怪 艾莉 He was strange, Ellie.
很有礼貌 但是很奇怪 Perfectly civil, but odd.
他还...

什么 What?
他注意到了我桌子上丹尼和克洛伊的照片 He noticed a picture of Danny and Chloe on my desk.
他问这是不是我的孩子 He asked if they were my kids.
所以他问起过丹尼的事 So he asked about Danny.
他说我有个美满的家庭 He said that I had a beautiful family.
贝丝 没事的 好吗 Beth, it's all right.

-我们会找到他的

光照在黑暗里 黑暗却不接受光 约翰福音1:

我刚开车经过教堂 I just drove by our savior,
公告板上有张丹尼的照片 and there's a picture of Danny in that little display thing.
肯定是保罗贴的 Paul must've put it there.
真的吗 你这么认为吗 Oh, yeah, you think?
旁边还有一小段引文 And there's a little quote
说什么光明和黑暗的 that says something about lightness and dark
说丹尼死了也没有关系 and that it's okay that Danny's dead
因为上帝会让他安息 because God's gonna make it okay.
我觉得应该不是那个意思 I doubt that's what it says.
-你能让他把那它撤下来吗

怎么 反正也不会挂很久 What

我差点就亲自动手撕了 I almost ripped it out myself.
那你不如给保罗打个电话 谈谈这事 Why don't you call Paul and talk about it?
因为我不想跟他有半点关系 从来没有 Because I want nothing to do with him.

圣诞节没有 复活节也没有 not for Christmas, not for Easter,
更别提那什么主日学校了 not for freaking sunday school,
而且你知道丹尼也特别讨厌那个 which you know Danny hated,
尤其是现在这种时刻我更不想找他 and especially not now.
-你去哪

天哪 God.
你应该看看他都干了什么 You should see what he's doing.
他上了两次电视 替我们发言 He went on TV twice, talking for the family,
还搞什么追悼会 pushing this memorial service.
不是他搞的 是我提出来想要的 He's not pushing it.

那我不想要 Well, I don't want it.
你知道他在干什么吗 You know what he's doing?
他想挑拨咱们俩的关系 He's trying to get in between us.
你发现了吗 Do you see that?
你能出去一下吗 我要换衣服 Are you gonna leave so I can change,
还是说要我去厕所换 or should I go into the bathroom?
你就不能在我面前光着身子吗 You can't be naked in front of me?
现在不能 我没这个心情 Not right now.

-艾莉阿姨

你可真固执 别费劲问了 You are stubborn.

不是案子的事 It's not about the case.
-那这事应该可以等吧

我联系了她的互助小组 I checked in with her support group,
她已经几周没去了 and she hasn't been there in weeks.
我和她聊了聊 And I talked to her.
她说她大部分晚上 She said she's been out most nights
都要去什么编织俱乐部 at some knitting club.
那告诉她可以给我织顶帽子 Well, tell her I could use a new hat.
我昨天去提款机取钱 I went to the bank machine yesterday.

我也这么以为 Yeah, so did I,
我试图和她谈起此事 but I tried to talk to her about it.
她要么否认 要么就挂我电话 She either denies or...

我知道你很忙 I know you're busy.
只是 我不知道现在还能怎么办 I just

我会去看她的 I'll go see her.
虽然不知道什么时候 但是我会去的 I don't know when, but I will.
坚持住 好吗 Hang in there, okay?
我跟他叔叔核实过了 I checked the uncle.
迪恩那晚的确在餐馆工作 Dean was working in the restaurant that night.
这边有什么发现 What have we got here?
这是拍到丹尼在加油站的录像 Um, it's Danny in the gas station,
正如迪恩所说 just like Dean said,
但是感觉就像...

我完全不认识他 I don't recognize him.
他的确是丹尼 但是...

这不是我认识的那个孩子 I don't know this child.
看来咱们的小天使终归不是完美无缺的 Our angel wasn't such an angel after all.
这话什么意思 What does that mean?
是说他活该吗 What, that he got what he deserved?
拜托你告诉我不是这意思 Please tell me that's not what you're saying.
只是觉得看到这样的他 It's just that this fills in the picture
才更真实 a little more clearly.
