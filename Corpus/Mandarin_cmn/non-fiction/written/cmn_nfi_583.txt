还没习惯新月城的夜生活吗 Brody 【注："新月城"即指新奥尔良】 Haven't gotten used to the Crescent City nightlife, Brody?
是我住的地方不好 It's my living situation.
在布罗德（位于新奥尔良城内）短期租了一个双人房 Short

每天晚上都一样 喝得烂醉的大学生 Every night the same thing:

还有放爆竹的小孩儿 and neighborhood kids lighting firecrackers.
你知道那可不是爆竹 You know those aren't firecrackers.
我想尽量乐观点嘛 I was trying to be optimistic.
哟 有人昨晚玩得很嗨啊 Oh, someone party hard last night?
是邻居太吵 Noisy neighbors.
我在逗她呢 Oh, I'm just hazing her.
我知道Brody不出门的 I know Brody doesn't go out.
我出门啊 我可能 I go out.

不会去城里那些高档餐厅 to the places where fine dining meets hurricanes,
但是我的确也出去玩儿的 but I do go out.
呵呵 当然啦 Brody Yeah, sure, you do, Brody.
好了 Christopher 什么情况 All right, Christopher, what we got?
靴子是目前海军配发的标准装备 Boot is current Navy issue, so we're operating
所以我们猜想 这条腿也是海军的 on the assumption the leg is as well.
-Dwayne Christopher

给你找个让你满意的地方 Find you a place you're gonna love.
对"今日捕捞"的身份鉴别 Where we at with I.

进行得怎么样了 Loretta catch of the day, Loretta?
DNA要花很长时间 不幸的是 DNA'll take time.

没有其它可用于鉴别的特征 只能够确定 there's no identifying characteristics other than...
受害者很可能是非裔美国人 ...the victim's most likely African

据腐烂程度来看 Based on the decomp, I'd say
这条腿至少已经在水里泡了一周了 the leg's been in the water at least a week.
是鳄鱼袭击 Gator attack?
肌肉断裂不会这么干净 Muscle cut's too clean.
划船事故 Boating accident?
愤怒的鲨鱼 【注：

勇猛的乌贼 Rabid squid?
来自地狱的变种海星 Mutant starfish from hell?
缓和下气氛 Just trying to keep it light.
根据骨头上的印记来看 Based on the marks on the bones,
不会是螺旋桨 I'd say it's inconsistent with a propeller
或者变种海星 or a mutant starfish, but...
我认为是单刃刀具造成的 I think it's a single blade.
要进行尸检才能确定 Have to autopsy to make sure.
好的 Christopher All right, Christopher,
带我们新来的中西部姑娘 take our recent Midwestern transplant
去见识一下海岸警卫队 and introduce her to the Coast Guard,
叫他们协助调查 get them to help in the search.

他无故缺勤了 he's unauthorized absence.
你确定 You sure?
他的长官好几天没有他的消息了 【注：

-我以为他联系你了

他亲口告诉过我 你引导他加入海军 He told me himself just how much you helped him out
对他帮助很大 by steering him towards the Navy.
没多少人会帮助一个男孩 Not many people would help a boy
逃离他那样的经历 escape a past like his.
Calvin其实自己也能办到 Yeah, well, Calvin would have found his own way.
我只是推了他一把 I just gave him a little push.
你该为他骄傲 Yeah, well, you should be proud of him.
那孩子从第一天起就是个优秀的海军 That kid's been a squared

他可能就是被某个姑娘绊住脚了 He probably just found some young lady to distract him.
但如果真是这样 But if that's the case,
他会受到纪律处分 he will be facing disciplinary action.
如果你有他消息的话 Give me a call
给我打个电话 好吧 if you hear from him, will you?
我会的 Yeah.

很高兴见到你 Pride Good to see you, Pride.
Loretta 我有一个奇怪的请求 Loretta.

不会比我解剖桌上穿着靴子的这条腿更奇怪 Not as strange as a boot with a leg on my autopsy table.
你能根据受害者脚的尺寸 Could you use the size of a victim's foot
推测出一个大概形象吗 as a basis for a general description?
嘿 Pride Hey, Pride.
或者我该叫你Dwayne 【注：

我觉得如果我叫你Dwayne的话 I thought it might be more appropriate for me
可能更合适 毕竟我们 to start calling you Dwayne, what with us
为NCIS做咨询服务这么多年了 consulting for NCIS all these years.
叫名字表示我们很熟啊 After all, the use of first names is a sign of familiarity,
而且现在也不是"姓氏代表职业" and we're a far cry from when the surname was an indication
-那个古老的年代了 所以...

我暂时还是叫你Pride吧 I'll stick with Pride, for now.
言归正传 我用电脑模拟 Yeah.

来估计死者的身高 体重和年龄 to estimate height, weight and age of the deceased
以免找不到尸体 in case the body was never found.

把他平常接触的人过一遍 we'd canvass his day

他被派往码头边的舰队后勤中心 He was assigned to the pier

他在码头工作 负责装卸库存 He worked the wharfs, loading inventory,
食物 以及设备 food and equip.
好 你俩去码头 Okay, you two take the wharfs.

拿一下我的...

Pride 如果你需要的话 我可以去停尸房 Pride, I can take the morgue, if you like.
毕竟...

你可以歇一歇 这次不参与了 you might want to take a pass on this one.
我和老爹有近十年的交情 Got a decade

你觉得我会袖手旁观吗 You think I'm just gonna sit on my hands?
如果我们发现的事情 And if the things we uncover
是你和他都不愿看到的 怎么办 are things you and he don't want to hear?
该面对的总得面对 We face what we got to face.
带上Brody Take Brody,

干什么呢 啊 are you two doing?

快去Governor Nicholls码头 Get over to Governor Nicholls Street Wharf,
把那些货盘卸下来 off

老得盯着那些笨蛋 Got to keep an eye on the chuckleheads.
你刚刚说到什么"旧习" You said, uh, something about "old habits."
对 我就是 Yeah, just,
呃 听到和Calvin值同一班的人说 uh...

他们说看到他和本地的小混混们一起 They said that they saw him leave in a lowrider
坐一辆低底盘的汽车走了 with some local bangers.
小混混就是黑帮成员 Bangers are gang members.
我在底特律 【注：

就是做审讯的 out of Detroit.
我懂黑话 谢了 I know the lingo.

有谁看见了那些 Anyone get a look at any of these...
"小混混"么 bangers?
我说了 Like I said,
我不在现场 没看到 I wasn't there to see this,
不过 他们说 but...

那群人看起来不是善类 that, uh, they didn't look too friendly.
尸体被包裹在塑料布里 Body was discovered
埋在靠近11号高速公路的 wrapped in plastic in a shallow grave
一个浅坑里 near Highway 11.
在新奥尔良东部 New Orleans East.
11号高速公路靠近爱尔兰海湾 Highway 11 is near the Irish Bayou.
通向庞恰特雷恩湖 That channels into Lake Pontchartrain.
断腿是从海湾里捞起来的 The leg was scooped up in the Gulf.
这怎么解释 How does that make sense?
我不知道是什么凶器造成的 I don't even know what the weapon is yet,
但伤口是在死前形成的 也就是说 but the severing is antemortem, which means
腿被砍断时 他还活着 it was disassociated while he was still alive.
这说明 凶手在流向海湾的水域附近杀了他 So, they kill him near a body of water that flows to the Gulf.
把断腿扔在那里 The

而尸体被包裹 转移 并且掩埋 and the body is wrapped, moved and buried?
我们在双手指关节处 We have significant contusions
都发现了明显的擦伤 on the knuckles of both hands.
打了一架 So, a fight?
这是防御性伤口 Well, it's defense wounds.
尽管伤得很严重 And although the outcome was grievous,
Calvin把对方狠狠揍了一顿 Calvin got some good licks in.
这只是初步推测 It's the basic theory.
Sebastian进行了模拟 Sebastian did the simulation.
凶手遇到Calvin 发生争执 The killer came upon Calvin, there was an altercation.
凶手有一件大型利器 The killer had a large, sharp object.
比如斧头 Think Axe.
攻击分割了肢体 然后...

Calvin失血过多而死 Calvin bled out.
-Dwayne

好的 Okay.
我们在衣物上发现了这个 We found this caught up in the clothing.
是第二双尖牙 It's a second bicuspid,
应该是右侧的 probably on the right side.
明显不是Calvin的 It's definitely not Calvin's,
因为他的牙齿依旧完好 'cause he's still sporting a full set.
所以凶手缺了一颗牙齿 So, whoever killed him is missing a tooth.
提取到DNA么 Pull DNA?
正在和本地犯罪数据库进行比对 Still running it through the local criminal database.
还有个东西 我觉得你应该看看 There's something else I think you should see.

我在扫黄打非组里时见到过 I saw it when I was in vice.
黑帮让前成员重新加入 Gangs get their former members to recommit.
然后杀了他们 Then they kill 'em.
以此来告诫帮里的新人们 It's an effective way to show the kids
"退出"根本办不到 that getting out is not an option.
这被称为"致命欺侮" It's called "dead hazing."
应该叫"虐待狂" It's called "sadistic."
如果不是三角帮干的呢 What if the Delta Crew didn't do it themselves?
那就是113帮 Well, it'd be the 1

三角帮和113帮已经交战多年了 Delta Crew and 1

确定他们与Calvin Parks的谋杀案有关 determined that they had a hand in Calvin Parks' murder.
那你还要多久才能确定 Well, how long is it gonna be before you determine something?
因为人民希望街道整肃安全 'Cause people want their streets cleaned up,
有时候 真正重要的只是表象 and sometimes, all that matters is appearances.

那么小数字一定是...

是重量 好 我们再看看数字 Were weights.

查出其它的货物 and figure out what the other shipments were.
没问题 我们还可以点面包布丁吗 Okay, fine, but can we still have some bread pudding?
当然 Absolutely.
你记得上一次 Do you remember the last time
我在新奥尔良的时候吗 Loretta I was in New Orleans, Loretta?
-2004年12月25号

那是自1989年以来 新奥尔良 Which happened to be the only snowfall day in New Orleans
下的唯一一场雪 since 1989.
如果是你造成那场降雪的话 Well, if you were the cause of the snow,
那可不欢迎你回来 you're not welcome back.
很高兴见到你 Pride探员 Good to see you, Agent Pride.
好医生和我刚刚弄明白 I think the good doctor and I just figured out
Calvin的纹身为什么会褪色 why Calvin's tattoo was coming off.
是的 大概四年前 Yes, I had a case
有个案子 nearly four years ago
死者的纹身 where the tattoo was applied
在死亡几小时前才纹上 only hours prior to the victim's death.
结果是 纹身的微小伤口没有时间愈合 The result:

因为血液无法凝固 because the blood couldn't congeal.
我们认为Calvin这次也是同样 We think that's what's going on with Calvin.
好吧 那么...

我们尝试以Ducky的案件作为对比基线 We tried to use Ducky's case as a baseline to approximate
推断Calvin是什么时候做的纹身 when Calvin received the tattoo,
相差大约三小时 and the difference was approximately three hours.
他在死前三小时做了纹身 He got the tattoo three hours before he died?
不 No.
在这个案件里 In this case,
图案是死后纹上去的 the tattoo was applied after death.
墨水无法附着 因为根本没有血液流动 The ink won't hold because there's no blood flow at all.
所以Calvin没有重回三角帮 So Calvin wasn't back with the Delta Crew.
是凶手给他做了这个纹身 Killer put the tat on.
在他死后 Posthumously.
让他看上去是被帮派的人杀害的 To make this look like part of a gang killing.
做得好 That's good work.
应该是4 That'd be a four.
好 减掉那个 然后告诉我新数字 Okay, so subtract that and give me the new number.
嘿 Hey!
哦 他起来了 Oh, he's up.
-你俩一夜没睡吗

也睡不成什么觉 any sleep at my place anyway.
我们为了你 特意小声说话来着 We made a point of trying to keep it down for you.
你打呼噜 You snore.
声音很大 Loud.
我才不呢 No, I don't.
你能来看看这个吗 Can you take a look at this?
既然帮派那个调查方向不对 So, working off the theory
在排除那个理论之后 我们确信 that the gang angle isn't real, we are convinced
凶案一定和Calvin在码头的工作有关 that the murder had to do with Calvin working at the wharf.
Calvin电脑里的大数字 Those big numbers in Calvin's computer,
是在港口装载的不同货物的NIIN编号 they're all NIIN for different items loaded at the port.
3493 菠萝 3493, pineapple.
8748 香蕉 9449 咖啡 8748, bananas.

都出自同一艘船 All coming in on the same boat, which originated
-一艘在危地马拉起航的船

这些货盘都被称重了 对吧 the pallets are weighed, right?
然后这艘船开到了新奥尔良 Then the boat sails to New Orleans,
全部货物被转移到海军舰艇上 where all the cargo is transferred to Navy ships.
但在上船之前 又称了一次 But before it's put aboard, it's weighed again.
Calvin邮件里那些小数字 The smaller numbers in Calvin's e

就是在危地马拉和新奥尔良 those are the difference between the Guatemala
-所称重量的差别

到海军手里时重量轻了一些 being lighter by the time the Navy got a hold of them?
走私 Smuggling.
根据重量的差别 Based on the weight differentials,
我们认为 是枪支或者毒品 we're thinking, uh, guns or drugs.
问题就是 So the question is,
Calvin被谋杀 是因为他发现了这件事 was Calvin murdered because he found out about it
还是因为他参与了这件事 or because he was in on it?
参与其中 In on it?
他电脑上的密码 Password on his computer,
用代号写的电子邮件 e

-我是Lasalle

Sebastian 你有什么发现 Sebastian, what do you got?
我正站在新奥尔良C区 I'm standing outside the offices of Councilman Hamilton
Hamilton议员办公室门外 of District C here in New Orleans.
他今天将要召开一个新闻发布会 He'll be hosting a press conference today
谈谈近期对这座城市造成不良影响的 to talk about a recent rash of gang violence
帮派暴力事件 that's hit the city.
总而言之 Hamilton议员 All in all, Councilman Hamilton
在今年的市长选举之前 is positioning himself as a law

把自己定位为一个宣扬法治的候选人 ahead of this year's mayoral election.
好了 关了吧 Okay, turn it off.
Sebastian想要 Sebastian wants
给我们看点东西 to show us something.
是关于纹身墨水的 It's about the tattoo ink.
好 去吧 All right, do it.
我去会会他 I'll deal with him.
我很希望你不要再把我的凶杀案调查 I'd appreciate if you'd stop using my murder investigation
当做登上舞台的理由 as an excuse to grandstand.
我真是不明白 All right, he

你在整个新奥尔良都深受爱戴 All right, you are beloved from Bourbon Street to the swamps
因为你竭尽全力 'cause you go out of your way to be of assistance
来帮助整个城市 包括...

理事会里我所有的同行 all of my counterparts on the council.
但你我仍然不能和睦相处 And yet you and I still can't get along.
也许他们就是比你友善 Well, maybe they're just nicer than you.
你想要一支特遣部队逮捕罪犯吗 我完全支持 You want a task force to roll up crime?

我们现在就离开这里去抓人 Let's right now get out there and go arrest people.
我只有两个条件 I only have two conditions:
我们以真实的罪名逮捕他们 We arrest them for things they've actually done,
并且不要带相机 and we leave the cameras behind.
你干嘛这么在乎啊 Pride Uh, what do you care, Pride?
不过是一个黑帮的人被另一个砍了罢了 It was just a gangbanger who got chopped up by another one.
他有名字 He had a name.
他叫Calvin Parks Calvin Parks.
你再说一次他是黑帮的人 You call him a gangbanger again,
我们之间的关系会更糟 and our getting along problem is gonna get a whole lot worse.
你们知道食品药品监督管理局 【注：

对纹身墨水没有管制吗 doesn't regulate tattoo ink?
这可真奇怪 It's a weird quirk.
他们管制用在皮肤表面的化妆品 They regulate makeup that's applied on top of the skin,
但是墨水会进入皮肤之下 他们就不管了 but since the ink goes under the skin, it's not covered.
-意思是

他们在颜料中 required to report what heavy metals
使用了什么重金属 they use for pigment bases.
而且 墨水也没有标准配比 And...

有些含镉 有些使用铁和铜 Some inks contain cadmium, others use iron and copper.
所以他们生产出来的成品就像是...

像指纹一样 Is like a fingerprint.
更像DNA More like DNA,
但你反应很快嘛 Brody探员 but you're cooking with gas, Agent Brody.
总之 我把供应商的名单缩小到了七个 Anyway, I narrowed down the list of suppliers to seven.
对他们的墨水做了测试 与Calvin的组织样本进行比对 Then I tested their inks against Calvin's tissue sample,
只有一家 and there is only one
使用了完全相同的钡钛混合物 that uses that exact barium-
就在弹药库街上 【注：

我很乐意和你们分享这个成果 但有一个条件 And I will gladly share this with you under one condition.
还有条件 There's a condition?
带我一起去 我得离开这个实验室 Take me with you.

看看活的东西 and just see something that's alive.
真想知道后代子孙会怎么看待 Got to wonder what future civilizations are gonna think
我们对于这古老墨水艺术的痴迷 about our dabbling in the ancient arts of ink.
他们会说酒精和纹身不是个好组合 They'll say drinking and tatting don't mix.
我屁股上的Big A1就是这么来的 【注：

冲啊 【注：

你知道么 我想过把元素周期表里 You know, I thought about getting
惰性气体那一列纹在这儿...

或者《指环王》里的什么图案 That or something from Lord of the Rings.
嗯 Hmm.
Brody Brody?

他嘴里情况如何 What's he got going on in his mouth?

在和他工作关系密切的人里 有谁可能 he was working closely with, who might have also had access
获悉为海军运送货物的信息 to shipments intended for the Navy.
没问题 Of course.
乐意效劳 资料都在办公室里 Anything to help.

我能说两句么 Can I say something?
他对Harold是走私者这事儿接受得太快了 Awfully quick to accept Harold as a smuggler?
而且如果我缺了一颗牙齿 And if I'd lost a tooth...
我也会用冰块来缓解疼痛 I'd use ice to dull the pain.

所以你把他杀了 You had him killed him to make sure he didn't report
确保他不会向他的上级报告 what he knew up his chain of command.

是个误导我们的好办法 a clever way to throw us off.
我想不通的是 What's bothering me
在你的应聘档案里 is your employment file.

所以让海关视而不见 getting customs to look the other way on a smuggling ring?
是谁煽动了帮派间的火拼 Who'd incite a gang war
来证明一个特遣小组存在的意义 to justify a task force?
而且是谁知道 And who would have known enough
Calvin年少时误入迷途 about Calvin's youthful indiscretions
所以想出了纹身这招 to have suggested a tattoo?
