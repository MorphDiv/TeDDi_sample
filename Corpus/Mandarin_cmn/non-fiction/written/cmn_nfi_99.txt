心灯明灭 伴君夜行 翻译:

今夜 我们将发动最后也是最强有力的战役 And tonight we embark on the last and most ambitious...
终结全球的暴政 phase of our campaign to end tyranny across the globe.
总统先生 您觉得在当前的危机下 Mr.

美国民众将面临何种危险?

我们已作好了万全的准备 Our level of preparedness couldn't be higher.
无论发生什么 我相信合众国都能获得胜利 I am confident that we will prevail, whatever may come.
可是 总统先生 But, Mr.

放心吧 政府正在采取措施 Rest assured, my administration is taking steps...
确保大家能继续活下去 to ensure our way of life will continue.
总统先生 最后的声明是否和那个...

"诺亚方舟"的流言有关 of these so

我们听到消息说 许多科学家 工程师和医生 We're hearing reports of scientists, engineers, doctors...
在夜里突然失踪 being whisked away in the night.
是不是政府把他们藏进了地下的避难所?

我们有许多应急计划 We have a number of contingency plans in place,
主要是为了安定人心 mainly to provide peace of mind.
不过我可以很明确的说 But let me be very clear.
保护美国人民的安全是第一优先级 Our priority is the safety of all the American people.
先生 会不会发生大灾难?

难道政府有权决定谁生谁死吗?

总统说了许多 但言辞空洞无物 Plenty of words from this president but very few details.
越长时间得不到明确的答案 And as more time passes with no clear answers...
我们的形势就越加绝望 the situation becomes more dire.

这样不对 That's not right.
嘿 检查监测设备是你的责任 Hey, you were responsible for checking the diagnostics!
你受伤了?

- 让我瞧瞧

来吧 别耍孩子气了 Oh, come on.

怎么伤的?

你那个傻逼维生仓 From your stupid tank.
这我该怎么愉快地撸管啊?

用那只手呗 Use the other hand.
如果我两只手都要用呢?

妈的 空气快没了 Shit, we're out of air.
我不知道现在咱们呼吸的是啥 I don't know what we're breathing.
但反正所剩不多了 There's not much left of it.
快查啊 手册上怎么说的?

稍等一下 马上 One second, one second.
有了 "打开安全储备气罐的应急装置" Bingo. "Emergency release via Safety Reserve Cylinders."
让我瞧瞧 Here, let me see.
啊哈 这个你一定喜欢 Aah.

看来咱们要爬到通风布线室去 Looks like we gotta go up the Airway Routing Chamber.
上吧 这不比你钻维生仓麻烦 Come on, it's not any harder than getting in your tank.
的确 Exactly.
手册上说了这是什么地方没?

应急操作室之类的吧 Somewhere in this jury

要不你留在这查看一下?

你是说这个红色阀门吗?

不 别碰那个 No, don't touch that one.
外头的空气有毒 Reds the air outside.
嘿 Hey.
找到了 过来 Found it, over here.
紧急供电供气装置 Emergency air and power supply.
就这儿 Yeah, here.
起作用没?

嘘 别说话 Shh.

省点空气吧 Save your air.
不管用 It's not working.
还是没空气 Still nothing.
我曾有个妻子 I had a wife.
什么?

还有三个女儿 Three little girls.
这工作不是要求单身吗?

我撒谎了 I lied...
求个饭碗嘛 你懂的 to get the job, you know.
谁他妈知道世界末日真的会来呢?

在他们锁上这里的门之前 Before they locked the doors.
你能想象留在地上那些人的样子吗?

我很遗憾 I'm sorry.
那时其实我有一点时间 I had about a minute.
我可以爬上去 和他们在一起 I could've gone up, been with them.
他们会把我们都锁进来 And they sealed us in.
你无能无力的 There's nothing you could have done.
你不明白 你又没有过家庭 You don't understand.

我能想象 I can imagine.
不 你不能 No, you can't.
现在只有你和我了 It's just you and me now.
我们就是家人 We're a family.
储备空气启动了 Reserved air just kicked in.
开始下一步吧 Time to make our next move.
赶快 时间很紧了 Let's go, clock's ticking.
那些东西在哪?

手册上没说 It doesn't say.
有没有看错区什么的?

"休眠容易 维护与替换说明" 在这儿 "Deep Sleep Vessel, Service and Replacement Instruction," right here.
兄弟 我和你说过 这里的设备就是半调子 Man, I told you this is a half

他们连零备件都没给我们留 They don't even have spare parts for us.
不 在什么地方一定有备件 他们会留的 No, the parts are down here somewhere.

瞧啊 最后关头胡拼乱凑的设备 You see, this is what happens
结果就是这个操行!

储藏室不止一个 This is not the only storage room.
老兄 这里每寸地方我都门清 Man, I know every inch of this place.
还看这建筑图搞毛啊 This blueprint isn't gonna help you.
长期储藏室 Long

这都是给那些休眠者醒来时准备的垃圾 It's just a load of crap for when the sleepers wake up.
这个区域我们根本没维护 We're not maintaining that area.
这些数字是什么意思?

不知道 I don't know.
这里应该安全吧?

应该安全 毕竟还在大密封室之内 It should be, it's within the main seal.
封锁这里的唯一原因就是节省氧气 The only reason it's blocked off is to save oxygen.
我敢打赌备件就在里头 I bet the spare parts are in there.
好吧 All right.
一把定输赢 No second chances.
好 All right.
这地方脏死了 This place is creepy.
- 像个洞穴什么的

害怕了 老兄?

有点幽闭恐惧而已 Just feeling a little claustrophobic, that's all.
闭嘴!

什么动静?

动物之类的吧 Maybe it's an animal or something.
动物?

这地方连氧气都没有 There hasn't been any oxygen in here.
嗯 你说得对 Oh, yeah, you're right.
来吧 我们试试这扇门 Come on, let's try this door right here.
来吧 Come on.
鲍尔 这什么东西?

你觉得像什么?

这些摄像头是干嘛的?

都没显示在我们的监视系统上 They don't show up on our monitors.
老式安全系统 That's the old security system.
防共党渗透的 Watch out for Commies.
你觉得这些东西还在运作吗?

不可能 这儿啥都没有 我们走吧 No.

艾比 艾比 艾比 Abby, Abby, Abby.
鲍尔!

我找到了 I found it.
好家伙 Oh, yeah.
好了 我想应该差不多了 All right, I think it's ready.
什么叫"你想"?

我都准备去睡觉了 I'm ready for bed.
我先试试吧 以防万一 I should go in first, just in case something happens.
没什么万一 我们搞定了 Nothing's gonna happen.

- 是吗?

你跳进去 然后重头开始 Jump in.

我再检查一下 马上就好 Let me just check something.

这样吧 Fine.
我替你入仓 你去启动监测系统 I'll pinch hit.

不 还是我来吧 这是我的维生仓 应该我先上 No, I should do it.

我们越快搞定 就能越快睡觉 The sooner we do this, the sooner we get some sleep.
你确定?

当然 Yep.
有什么情况 给我个信号 If anything seems off, just give a sign.
- 帮我拉上吧

- 准备?

嘿!

嗯 怎么了?

你听到没?

我什么都没听到 I don't hear anything.
好像是哪儿漏气 Sounds like a leak.
- 真的吗?

这里的空气越来越稀薄了 And the air is definitely getting thinner in here.
- 你确定?

去检查一下气泵 Check the air pump.
好 我去查查 Okay, let me check.
卡特莱特?

让我出去吧 我去查 Hey, let me out of here.

气泵我自己去查 I'll check it myself.
卡特莱特!

卡特莱特!

卡特莱特!

鲍尔 Bauer'.
对不起 I'm so sorry.
上帝啊 真对不起 My God, I'm so sorry.
你没事吧?

你去哪儿了?

我就在这儿!

出了什么事?

我打不开维生仓 I couldn't get the tank open!
所以去找东西割开它 So I was looking for something to cut it.
怎么找那么久?

我和你说了 我没找着美工刀!

维生仓是怎么回事?

我不知道 I don't know.
也许我漏检了什么 Maybe I missed something.
你漏检了?

这是意外事故 It was an accident.
对你而言这倒是挺方便啊 It would've been so convenient for you, huh'!
两个人 一个维生仓 One tank between the two of us.
一下子问题就解决了 All your problems solved.
你疯了吧?

在里头的本来是我!

- 是吗?

记得吗?

是我坚持的 你说得对 I did.

- 对不起

也许是个蠢问题...

我不知道 I don't know.
剩下的空气只有这么点 And that's all the reserve air we got.
得改变计划了 All right, change of plans.
好吧 All right.
哪个看上去不错?

什么不错?

好吧 也许不用那个 All right, maybe not that one.
这家伙怎么样? "鱼类学" What about this guy right here? "Ichthyology."
我他妈都不知道这啥意思 I don't even know what that means.
我们不能打开这些维生仓 自己钻进去 We can't just open one of the tanks and put me inside.
为什么不能?

仓里的这些人怎么办?

被我们拉出来会是什么下场?

大概会被我们干掉吧 Well, I guess we kill him.
什么?

我们在这里的唯一原因 就是维持他们的生命 The only reason why we're here is to keep these people alive.
他们是仅存的人类文明之光了 They're the last remnants of human civilization.
光你妈逼!

谁死谁活不能由我们决定!

那我告诉你我们能干什么 我们能顾好自己 You know what we can do?

不 应该说 我们俩彼此照应 No, you know what?

这才是家人 That's what families do.
现在你自己挑一个 马上 Now, you need to pick one right now.
好吧 All right.
很好 All right.
吗啡?

趁他在里头时来一剂 Give him a heavy dose while he's still inside.
别这么做 Don't do this.
我别无选择 What choice do I have?
还有个办法 There's another way.
我们没有时间了 We don't have time.
其实很简单的 It's as simple as ABC.
你他妈又怎么了?

- 我下不了手

不 我不干!

行啊 注射器给我 老子自己干 Fine.

听我说 听我说 还有其他办法 Listen, listen, listen, there's another way.
听着 我知道你的圣母心很受伤 Look, I know this breaks your soft little heart...
但不想从游戏里出局 but sometimes you've gotta sacrifice
有时就得牺牲个把小兵 a pawn to stay in the game.
阻止他 Don't let him.
我说了 这种事我不干 I said, I'm not doing this.
你不想活了吗?

这是谋杀 It's murder.
鲍尔 我们是工程师 不是杀人犯!

我操 Come on.
如果被其他方舟的人发现了怎么办?

睁开眼看看周围 这儿就我们俩!

这不叫谋杀 这叫求生 It's not murder, it's survival.
听我说 我们有责任保证这些人的生命安全 Listen, we have an obligation to keep these people alive.
老兄 你这人还真难搞啊 You're a piece of work, man, you know that?

感觉到了吗?

等到这儿的空气耗尽 That's what it's going to feel like
就是这种感觉 when the air runs out down here.
你的肺拼命想要氧气 却一点也吸不到 Your lungs starving for oxygen and there isn't any.
总有人得去死啊 抱歉 Look, someone's gonna die, I'm sorry.
可你也别想扔下我一个人 But you are not leaving me here alone.
求你了 别这样 Please, don't do it.
等会儿你就该感谢我了 You'll thank me later.
够了 That's enough.
你拿着那玩意儿想干嘛?

嗯?

来啊 割断我的喉咙啊 Go ahead, cut my throat.
- 一下解决你所有问题

老子在救你的命!

你没明白 听我说 You don't understand.

不 是你不明白 No, you don't Understand.
这些休眠者 正是踩在你我这样的人头上 These people, they got their ticket to the future...
拿到了通往未来的门票!

你还想用自己的生命去拯救他们?

跟你讲了 我有个办法 I told you, I have an idea.
一句话 你来不来?

好 好 算我一个 Yeah.

咱们是朋友嘛 What are friends for, right?
伙计 我不太确认 Man, I don't know.
但编码匹配 But the codes match.
这儿有ABC 109 ABC 108 here.
这也有 And ABC 108.
我觉得这是另一艘"方舟" 就在这里 I'm telling you, there's another facility, right here,
就在我们旁边 next to us.
也许吧 Maybe.
也什么许啊?

这太危险了 伙计 It's too dangerous, man.
我们都不知道外头什么状况 We don't even know what's out there.
你看监视器 他们有签到的 They checked in.

这艘方舟里的人一定有备件 There are people in that facility with spare parts.
得打开红标密封门 You're gonna have to break the red seal.
- 是的 有风险

这艘方舟就是个易碎的肥皂泡 This facility's a fragile bubble.
出一点岔子 One wrong thing and this whole place
整个地方就会灌满毒气 fills up full of contaminated air.
那就不是他们死一个的问题了 咱们全得翘辫子 Then instead of just killing one of them, we all die.
我们确保万无一失就好 We'll just have to make sure nothing happens.
能听到我说话吗?

好了 All right.
- 鲍尔...

那么 祝你好运 Good luck, all that.
- 我操!

有具死尸 是名士兵 A dead body.

我军还是敌军?

看不出来 I can't tell.
谢天谢地 他没打坏这扇气密门 Lucky he didn't shoot out the airlock door.
愿你下辈子好运 Better luck in the next life.
快走吧 兄弟 你在浪费空气 Come on, buddy, you're wasting air.
我得等空气过滤器停下 I'm waiting on the air filters.
好 Okay.
祝我好运吧 Wish me luck.
祝你好运 Good luck.
好的 Okay.
外头有什么发现?

只有尘埃 蓝色的尘埃 到处都是 Just dust.

那是空气污染物 Yeah, that's the airborne contaminant.
这儿的氧气还有31分钟 兄弟 You got 31 minutes left, buddy.
你要不快点回来 我就只有六个月后去找你了 If you're not back soon, I'll see you in six months.
虽然民众都在尽快转移到避难所 Trying to move people as quickly as possible...
但也有流言说 这些大众避难所其实无法防范...

那些化学武器 against these chemical weapons.
噢 我看到你了 Oh, hey.

某个监视器显示了你的画面 Yeah, I see you on one of the monitors.
你说得对 那些老式摄像头还在运行 You're right, those old cameras still work.
竖个大拇指看看 Give me a thumbs

很好 继续走吧 All right, cool, keep moving.
好了 All right,
我看看你去的什么鬼地方 I'm just trying to figure out where the hell you're going.
我想我找到了 I think I've found it.
你说得对 Oh, you were right.
它卡住了 It's stuck.
加油啊 你个娘娘腔 用力推 Come on, you big sissy.

我进来了 I'm in.
很好 帮我向ABC那帮兄弟问好 All right, say hi to the ABC people for me.
- 鲍尔?

我们有麻烦了 I think we got a problem.
这里的系统失效了 It's not working.
设备还工作吗?

不 设备都没正常运转 No, nothing's working.
看上去你被锁在外头了 伙计 Looks like you're locked out, buddy.
喂!

别叫了 别叫了 你在浪费空气 Hey, stop, stop, you're wasting air.
我只是希望有人能听到我的声音 Well, I was hoping somebody could hear me.
他妈的 我们现在怎么办?

冷静点 伙计 我正在处理 Sit tight, buddy, I'm working on it.
不要放弃 Don't give up.
如果他是对的呢?

你总能帮我们找到出路 You've always found a way for us.
没有你我一定会发疯的 I'd lose my mind without you.
嘿 伙计 Hey, buddy.
我在附近找到了一条路 I think I found a way around it
不过你不会喜欢的 but you're not gonna like it.
说说看 Just tell me.
往回走 大约十码 Back the way you came, about ten yards.
我要找什么?

见到了你自然知道 You'll know it when you see it.
- 开什么玩笑?

这上头根本就进不去人 There's no room up there.
没事的 兄弟 在咱们这儿 Come on, buddy, I've crawled through
我爬过这种通风管道 the exact same air ducts in our place.
我能做得到 你也可以 If I can do it, you can do it.
还有其他路吗?

如果你想让那头的家伙帮忙 Well, if you want those guys to help you,
那就只有这条路 that's your way in.
去吧 正好治治你的幽闭恐惧症 Come on, it's a good way to cure your claustrophobia.

这地方全是死人 This place is full of dead people.
他们朝哪个方向?

有人面朝你现在去的那个方向吗?

看不出来 I can't tell.
他们没能闯进去 好消息啊 The good news is, they didn't break in.
什么?

既然他们死在外头 If they died out there,
说明主通风系统依然保持密封状态 then the main ventilation system is still sealed.
你可别把面罩摘下来了 Hey, you do not want to throw up in your mask.
谢谢你的建议 Thanks for the advice.
我还有个主意 你也可以摘掉头盔 I got another idea.

拿去他们下头的二手市场卖卖 Join that little yard sale they got going on down there.
去死吧 鲍尔 Go to hell, Bauer.
鲍尔...

主过滤装置...

什么?

- 我说 能不能绕开主过滤装置?

- 请回答

听着 我去增强一下无线信号 Look, I'm gonna try to boost our radio signal.
不用担心 我就在这儿 Don't worry about it.

鲍尔 Bauer,.
请回答 Answer me.
鲍尔 你还在吗?

鲍尔 你还在吗?

我在 Yeah, I'm here.
我在过滤装置的支路上 I'm at the fitter bypass.
嘿 鲍尔...

能听到我吗?

祝你好运 兄弟 Good for you, buddy.
等等 有什么不对劲 Wait, something's not right.
我早知道不对劲 You're telling me.
很久以前就已经这样了 This must have happened a long time ago.
听不清 You're breaking up.
他们全都...

所有人...

都死了 dead.
无价之宝 不可或缺 Unique and irreplaceable.
可ABC 108 他们今天签到了 They were checked in today, ABC 108.
不止今天 每一次都有签到 They checked in today and every other time.
我们在系统上看到的 We saw it on the system.
你听到我的话了吗 鲍尔?

那是谎言 It's a lie.
整个系统都是谎言?

都是 All of it.
弥天大谎 It's a lie.
再不能相信任何东西了 Can't trust anyone anymore.
上帝啊 鲍尔 My God, Bauer.
这里根本没有网络 也没有连接到其他"方舟" There's no network.

只有我们 还有几台电脑 让我们错以为自己并不孤单 Just us and some computer telling us that we're not alone.
亲爱的 你并不孤单 You're not alone, my love.
这种设计 是为了防止我们精神失常吧 It's designed to keep us from losing our minds.
鲍尔 你还在吗?

我还能上哪儿去呢?

如果这个系统只是说谎的机器 If the system is a lie, automated...
那我们怎么知道外面还有没有其他人?

我们不知道 We don't.
我们什么都不知道 We don't know anything.
也许我们就是硕果仅存的人类 We might be the only ones left alive.
上帝啊 My God.
我的氧气快用完了 I'm running low on air.
- 我现在返回

就像你常说的 As you always say,
"只要时间足够久 一切都会改变" "Give it enough time, everything's gonna break."
猜猜我在哪找的这把美工刀?

不知道 哪儿?

工具箱里 还在我放的地方 In the toolbox, where I put it.
我记得自己把工具箱 And I remember putting the toolbox...
搁在了你的维生仓右边 顺手就能拿到 right next to your sleep tank, within easy reach.
是吗?

是啊 我也不敢相信 Yeah, I couldn't believe it either...
所以去检查了一下录像 so I checked the video recording.
等一下 我们好好谈谈 Just a minute, let's talk about this.
不必麻烦了 Don't bother.
你真该看看自己这张脸 You should see the look on your face.
你已经疯了对吗 伙计?

还是说你真的想杀了我?

让我进去 我们好好谈谈 Just let me in.

让你进来?

你已经疯了 不 你现在对我很危险 You have gone nuts.

对休眠者很危险 You're a danger to the sleepers.
对整个方舟都很危险 You're a danger to this whole facility.
鲍尔 求你了 Bauer, please.
我这可不是生你的气 It's not like I'm mad at you.
不 这话我收回 我对你...

给我个机会解释 Give me a chance to explain what happened.
机会没有第二回 No second chances.
你就把这当安乐死吧 Think of it as a mercy killing...
就像我该为自己家人做的那样 like I should have done with my family.
能和你聊天真好 伙计 Nice chatting with you, buddy.
你上哪儿去?

我在这里 I'm here.
我能上哪去呢 艾比?

呼吸 Breathe.
你来看 Just look.
你知道让我最心痛的是什么吗?

背叛和谎言 The betrayal and the lies.
我那么信任你 你居然要对我下手 I trusted you.

听好了 外头一无所有 你根本无处可去 Look, there's nothing out there.

要不你还是回来吧?

感觉如何啊?

回答我!

我做到了 艾比 一切都会好起来的 I made it, Abby.

一切都会好起来 Everything's gonna be okay.
卡特莱特?

你在不在?

文森特·鲍尔 你不必如此 Vincent Bauer, you don't have to do this.
我们也许是世界上仅存的两个人了 We might be the only ones left alive.
是吗?

我躺在那儿等死时 你是不是就这么想的?

看你那张小照片的时候呢?

对不起 是我的错 I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
嗯 我们都有错 Yeah, we both did.
好了 猫抓老鼠的游戏到此为止 All right, enough of this cat and mouse crap.
你也知道我不能放过你吧?

我总不能回到维生仓去躺着 Go lay back down in my tank...
等着我最好的朋友在梦中干掉我 see if my best friend's gonna kill me in my sleep?
卡特莱特!

你不这么做 他就会杀了你 If you don't do this, he'll kill you.
用这个很快 也没有痛苦 It'll be quick.

为了我们 你一定要动手 You have to do this for us.
你知道我有多难过吗?

我们不是家人吗!

她需要我!

你看 你看!

看你妹!

她需要我 我向她保证过的 She does.

听着 听着 我可以解释 Look, look, listen, I can explain everything.
原谅我 求你了 她需要我啊 我发过誓的!

艾比 亲爱的 我发过誓 永远不会离开你 Abby, honey, I promise I'll never leave you.
永远不离开 I promised I'd never leave you.
你和谁说话?

- 我不会离开你的 艾比

对不起 艾比!

- 我永远不会离开 对不起!

狗娘养的 Son of a bitch.
卡特莱特?

我知道你在这儿 伙计 I know you're in here, buddy.
你他妈当我傻啊?

以为我猜不出来?

至少现在我知道为什么这个白痴工作 At least now I know why this stupid job
对你如此重要了 is so important to you.
她一直都在这儿对吧?

你挚爱的妻子?

你不想决定谁死谁活?

哦 这就是结果 Well, that's what it's come to.
卡特莱特 Cartwright.
马上出来 我们作个了断 Come out here right now, we'll end this.
否则我杀了她 I'll kill her.
你以为我不敢吗?

老子要在她眉心开个洞!

你真应该看看自己那张脸 You should see the look on your face right now.
是我的天堂门票吗?

- 振作点 伙计

好好照顾你的女人 Take care of your girl.
快去吧 伙计 时间不等人 Go on, man, the clocks ticking.
我还活着 艾比 I'm alive, Abby.
但现在只剩下我了 But...

维护这儿的设备正常运转 Keeping this place functional.
自己和自己说话 Talking to myself.
睡在被我杀死那个人的床上 Sleeping in the bed of the man I killed.
只有我孤身一人 Just me now.
和无尽的时间 And time.
艾比 Abby.
心灯明灭 伴君夜行 翻译:

今夜 我们将发动最后也是最强有力的战役
终结全球的暴政
总统先生 您觉得在当前的危机下
美国民众将面临何种危险?
我们已作好了万全的准备
无论发生什么 我相信合众国都能获得胜利
可是 总统先生
放心吧 政府正在采取措施
确保大家能继续活下去
总统先生 最后的声明是否和那个...
"诺亚方舟"的流言有关
我们听到消息说 许多科学家 工程师和医生
在夜里突然失踪
是不是政府把他们藏进了地下的避难所?
我们有许多应急计划
主要是为了安定人心
不过我可以很明确的说
保护美国人民的安全是第一优先级
先生 会不会发生大灾难?
难道政府有权决定谁生谁死吗?
总统说了许多 但言辞空洞无物
越长时间得不到明确的答案
我们的形势就越加绝望
这里是新闻9频道 娜塔莉为您报道
做噩梦了 伙计?
让我出去 让我出去
拜托
该死的 鲍尔!
松松筋骨
别玩了 快拉我起来
没门
呼吸要逐步过渡到正常空气是为了防止什么?
氧中毒
氧中毒对什么器官有害?
眼睛 大脑 还有...
还有肺!
你怎能指望一个人睡了六个月之后
还能有个好脾气
什么我维生仓的开启周期是你的两倍?
噢 只要时间足够长
这鬼地方什么都会变的
- 你签到了没?

你真是的
我不想其他方舟的人认为我们...
我们怎么?

又不会要你的命
上面天气怎么样?
适合野餐不?
外面的氧中毒危险依然是红色级别
就像上次和上上次一样
真不知道你还签个什么劲儿
其他所有方舟都签了
一切正常
谢谢我的幸运星
噢 别又来了 老兄
一会儿就好 我有个想法
这种事情你要做多少次啊?
这鸟网络又不能...
不能直接通话 我知道
噢 要有互联网该多好
下次世界末日前他们最好给备上
最好厕所里先装一个 老兄
你懂我意思吧?
嘿 这可不好玩
你觉得这不是真的吗?
什么不是真的?
他们都死了
用不着你提醒我
今天的检查目标
看看这个
老兄啊 我看了有一百万次
都能背下来了
不不不 这儿说侦测到某种地震活动
什么?
是的 一场地震
我知道地震什么意思 具体怎么说的?
不太好
听着 如果有一丁点儿泄露
这地方就会被外面的毒气灌满
我们全得完蛋 还说什么?
电气系统和核心建筑检查
核心建筑?
开玩笑 这是个废弃的导弹发射井
那些维生仓呢?
要挨个单独检查
- 想得美

这样吧 除非这事你肯做 其余的我包了
你知道的 那些鸟休眠者老子看着不爽
- 不

这次轮到你了
猜拳?
1 2 3
赶紧吧 快 快!
我需要钱 我心情很糟
我要准备跑路了
但她是我遇见的最好女孩
我和法律作对 法律赢了
我和法律作对...
我和法律作对 法律赢了
我和法律作对 法律赢了
他快把你弄疯了吧?
我已经习惯了
我一直梦见你
伙计 诊断结果如何?
过滤装置九级测试均正常
地震活动没造成什么影响
维生仓怎样?
还在正常运作
你和他说了我们的事吗?
我在等合适的时机
你保证过的
我会告诉他
告诉我什么?
你在和谁说话?
没谁
最讨厌你这么干了
是啊
我最讨厌你和那些休眠者嘀咕
真恶心
他们也是人
是啊 你就那么站在一旁 盯着他们
你到底什么想法?
性变态啊?
你有资格说我吗?

哈 至少死了的妞我不泡
她没有死
她在等待 就和我们一样
嘿 别拿她和我比啊
我干这活是为了糊口
他们图个啥啊?
得了吧 你知道他们很重要
重要?
瞧瞧这边这货
"爬虫学"
这他妈啥啊?

爬行动物和两栖动物专家
哟 你还是个知识分子啊
这些人都是火种 鲍尔
世界上仅存的火种
他们的知识和经验是无价...
无价之宝 不可或缺 等等等等...
你活像个坏掉的复读机 老兄
他们是人类的未来 放尊重些吧
行了 伙计
别跟我扯这些鸡巴蛋
我们一辈子窝在这个耗子洞里
就为了让他们活下来?
我能理解你的感受
难道这些对你而言没有意义吗?
在地下工作?

拯救人类的未来
得了吧 醒过来 按个按钮
换个灯泡 接着回去睡大头觉
如此周而复始 兄弟
你就不觉得腻味啊?
不觉得
你该知道咱们这算吃亏吧?
那你打算怎么办?
去找领导哭诉吗?
是啊 也许会的
我想我该写封上诉信
写你个头
在这美好的下午 一场精彩的棒球赛
我们想提醒这场比赛的
每一位观众
参赛的两支队伍
将把所有门票收入捐献给
上星期欧洲炸弹袭击的灾后援救工作
在这悲伤的时刻 我们感谢所有人的支持
"空气污染概率计算" 有了
那是什么?
厕所小报吗?
嗯 "本方程式可用于计算距离地表可重新居住
所剩下的时间"
- 投第二个

- 投手不给力啊

"相关参数包括:

污染浓缩度 水平偏差" 是不是?
- 对吧?

他要来个全垒打了
"理想情况下 30年后地表才可居住
但这个时间也可能延长至150年"
- 听到没?

这比赛你都看了一百遍了
来啦!

全垒打!
我和你说 咱们可能不用再困多久了
是啊 只要再过一百年 是吧?
眨眼的功夫
按这儿说的 只要再轮20多班就行了
兄弟 天气预报这玩意儿
十次里头只有半次是对的
但你还是会继续研究 对吗?
我们在此中断正常节目
向您播报特别新闻
是啊 是啊 反正老子都听过了
我们刚刚确认
发生了一系列的爆炸事件
兄弟 该你下了
许多大城市 如慕尼黑 东京
伦敦和布里斯班都遭到了袭击
打算如何出招 象棋大师?
这些信息来自政府内部可靠的消息人士
虽然不是官方声明 但是...
虽然不是官方声明
但据我们所知 这些攻击很可能...
是一种核化学攻击武器
与今年早些毁灭了特拉维夫的武器类似
总统已经宣布进入一级战备状态
这是我国遭遇过最严重的威胁
就这样
你有六个月时间来后悔这步棋
等等 我以为不用这么快的
不行啊 时间不等人啰
- 这些监测器你都查过了?

正要准备我们的睡前小酒呢
很好 我和79年的美国小姐去约会了
要继续休眠了吗?
流程就是这样
我们很快就能在一起了
没什么好害怕的
我每次休眠前都对自己这么说
虽然心里清楚
但身体的本能却告诉我
自己在往一口高科技棺材里钻
你忘记了吗?
拜托 艾比 我有工作要做
想想吧 能碰到我的话 那感觉...

噢 不 不 不!
鲍尔!

什么鬼?
把灭火器给我 快点!
不是时候啊 兄弟!
快给我开门!
给我灭火器!

你用不着把它拆了
是啊 我以为拆了还有点用
这样不对
嘿 检查监测设备是你的责任
你受伤了?
- 让我瞧瞧

来吧 别耍孩子气了
怎么伤的?
你那个傻逼维生仓
这我该怎么愉快地撸管啊?
用那只手呗
如果我两只手都要用呢?
妈的 空气快没了
我不知道现在咱们呼吸的是啥
但反正所剩不多了
快查啊 手册上怎么说的?
稍等一下 马上
有了 "打开安全储备气罐的应急装置"
让我瞧瞧
啊哈 这个你一定喜欢
看来咱们要爬到通风布线室去
上吧 这不比你钻维生仓麻烦
的确
手册上说了这是什么地方没?
应急操作室之类的吧
要不你留在这查看一下?
你是说这个红色阀门吗?
不 别碰那个
外头的空气有毒
嘿
找到了 过来
紧急供电供气装置
就这儿
起作用没?
嘘 别说话
省点空气吧
不管用
还是没空气
我曾有个妻子
什么?
还有三个女儿
这工作不是要求单身吗?
我撒谎了
求个饭碗嘛 你懂的
谁他妈知道世界末日真的会来呢?
在他们锁上这里的门之前
你能想象留在地上那些人的样子吗?
我很遗憾
那时其实我有一点时间
我可以爬上去 和他们在一起
他们会把我们都锁进来
你无能无力的
你不明白 你又没有过家庭
我能想象
不 你不能
现在只有你和我了
我们就是家人
储备空气启动了
开始下一步吧
赶快 时间很紧了
那些东西在哪?
手册上没说
有没有看错区什么的?
"休眠容易 维护与替换说明" 在这儿
兄弟 我和你说过 这里的设备就是半调子
他们连零备件都没给我们留
不 在什么地方一定有备件 他们会留的
瞧啊 最后关头胡拼乱凑的设备
结果就是这个操行!
储藏室不止一个
老兄 这里每寸地方我都门清
还看这建筑图搞毛啊
长期储藏室
这都是给那些休眠者醒来时准备的垃圾
这个区域我们根本没维护
这些数字是什么意思?
不知道
这里应该安全吧?
应该安全 毕竟还在大密封室之内
封锁这里的唯一原因就是节省氧气
我敢打赌备件就在里头
好吧
一把定输赢
好
这地方脏死了
- 像个洞穴什么的

害怕了 老兄?
有点幽闭恐惧而已
闭嘴!

什么动静?
动物之类的吧
动物?
这地方连氧气都没有
嗯 你说得对
来吧 我们试试这扇门
来吧
鲍尔 这什么东西?
你觉得像什么?

这些摄像头是干嘛的?
都没显示在我们的监视系统上
老式安全系统
防共党渗透的
你觉得这些东西还在运作吗?
不可能 这儿啥都没有 我们走吧
- 我在这边找找

瞧啊 这还有某人收藏的唱片
艾比 艾比 艾比
鲍尔!

我找到了
好家伙
好了 我想应该差不多了
什么叫"你想"?
我都准备去睡觉了
我先试试吧 以防万一
没什么万一 我们搞定了
- 是吗?

你跳进去 然后重头开始
我再检查一下 马上就好
这样吧
我替你入仓 你去启动监测系统
不 还是我来吧 这是我的维生仓 应该我先上
我们越快搞定 就能越快睡觉
你确定?
当然
有什么情况 给我个信号
- 帮我拉上吧

- 准备?

嘿!
嗯 怎么了?
你听到没?
我什么都没听到
好像是哪儿漏气
- 真的吗?

这里的空气越来越稀薄了
- 你确定?

去检查一下气泵
好 我去查查
卡特莱特?
让我出去吧 我去查
气泵我自己去查
卡特莱特!
卡特莱特!
卡特莱特!
鲍尔
对不起
上帝啊 真对不起
你没事吧?

你去哪儿了?

我就在这儿!
出了什么事?
我打不开维生仓
所以去找东西割开它
怎么找那么久?
我和你说了 我没找着美工刀!
维生仓是怎么回事?
我不知道
也许我漏检了什么
你漏检了?
这是意外事故
对你而言这倒是挺方便啊
两个人 一个维生仓
一下子问题就解决了
你疯了吧?

在里头的本来是我!

- 是吗?

记得吗?
是我坚持的 你说得对
- 对不起

也许是个蠢问题...

我不知道
剩下的空气只有这么点
得改变计划了
好吧
哪个看上去不错?
什么不错?
好吧 也许不用那个
这家伙怎么样? "鱼类学"
我他妈都不知道这啥意思
我们不能打开这些维生仓 自己钻进去
为什么不能?
仓里的这些人怎么办?
被我们拉出来会是什么下场?
大概会被我们干掉吧
什么?
我们在这里的唯一原因 就是维持他们的生命
他们是仅存的人类文明之光了
光你妈逼!
谁死谁活不能由我们决定!
那我告诉你我们能干什么 我们能顾好自己
不 应该说 我们俩彼此照应
这才是家人
现在你自己挑一个 马上
好吧
很好
吗啡?

趁他在里头时来一剂
别这么做
我别无选择
还有个办法
我们没有时间了
其实很简单的
你他妈又怎么了?
- 我下不了手

不 我不干!
行啊 注射器给我 老子自己干
听我说 听我说 还有其他办法
听着 我知道你的圣母心很受伤
但不想从游戏里出局
有时就得牺牲个把小兵
阻止他
我说了 这种事我不干
你不想活了吗?
这是谋杀
鲍尔 我们是工程师 不是杀人犯!
我操
如果被其他方舟的人发现了怎么办?
睁开眼看看周围 这儿就我们俩!
这不叫谋杀 这叫求生
听我说 我们有责任保证这些人的生命安全
老兄 你这人还真难搞啊
感觉到了吗?
等到这儿的空气耗尽
就是这种感觉
你的肺拼命想要氧气 却一点也吸不到
总有人得去死啊 抱歉
可你也别想扔下我一个人
求你了 别这样
等会儿你就该感谢我了
够了
你拿着那玩意儿想干嘛?
嗯?

来啊 割断我的喉咙啊
- 一下解决你所有问题

老子在救你的命!

你没明白 听我说
不 是你不明白
这些休眠者 正是踩在你我这样的人头上
拿到了通往未来的门票!
你还想用自己的生命去拯救他们?
跟你讲了 我有个办法
一句话 你来不来?
好 好 算我一个
咱们是朋友嘛
伙计 我不太确认
但编码匹配
这儿有ABC 109
这也有
我觉得这是另一艘"方舟" 就在这里
就在我们旁边
也许吧
也什么许啊?
这太危险了 伙计
我们都不知道外头什么状况
你看监视器 他们有签到的
这艘方舟里的人一定有备件
得打开红标密封门
- 是的 有风险

这艘方舟就是个易碎的肥皂泡
出一点岔子
整个地方就会灌满毒气
那就不是他们死一个的问题了 咱们全得翘辫子
我们确保万无一失就好
能听到我说话吗?
好了
- 鲍尔...

那么 祝你好运
- 我操!

有具死尸 是名士兵
我军还是敌军?
看不出来
谢天谢地 他没打坏这扇气密门
愿你下辈子好运
快走吧 兄弟 你在浪费空气
我得等空气过滤器停下
好
祝我好运吧
祝你好运
好的
外头有什么发现?
只有尘埃 蓝色的尘埃 到处都是
那是空气污染物
这儿的氧气还有31分钟 兄弟
你要不快点回来 我就只有六个月后去找你了
虽然民众都在尽快转移到避难所
但也有流言说 这些大众避难所其实无法防范...
那些化学武器
噢 我看到你了
某个监视器显示了你的画面
你说得对 那些老式摄像头还在运行
竖个大拇指看看
很好 继续走吧
好了
我看看你去的什么鬼地方
我想我找到了
你说得对
它卡住了
加油啊 你个娘娘腔 用力推
我进来了
很好 帮我向ABC那帮兄弟问好
- 鲍尔?

我们有麻烦了
这里的系统失效了
设备还工作吗?
不 设备都没正常运转
看上去你被锁在外头了 伙计
喂!

别叫了 别叫了 你在浪费空气
我只是希望有人能听到我的声音
他妈的 我们现在怎么办?
冷静点 伙计 我正在处理
不要放弃
如果他是对的呢?

你总能帮我们找到出路
没有你我一定会发疯的
嘿 伙计
我在附近找到了一条路
不过你不会喜欢的
说说看
往回走 大约十码
我要找什么?
见到了你自然知道
- 开什么玩笑?

这上头根本就进不去人
没事的 兄弟 在咱们这儿
我爬过这种通风管道
我能做得到 你也可以
还有其他路吗?
如果你想让那头的家伙帮忙
那就只有这条路
去吧 正好治治你的幽闭恐惧症
好吧 我进去了
到十字路口了 走哪边?
往左就调头回去了 走右边
进入他们的主通风系统
噢 噢
你没事吧 兄弟?
没事
这地方全是死人
他们朝哪个方向?
有人面朝你现在去的那个方向吗?
看不出来
他们没能闯进去 好消息啊
什么?
既然他们死在外头
说明主通风系统依然保持密封状态
你可别把面罩摘下来了
谢谢你的建议
我还有个主意 你也可以摘掉头盔
拿去他们下头的二手市场卖卖
去死吧 鲍尔
鲍尔...
主过滤装置...
什么?

- 我说 能不能绕开主过滤装置?

- 请回答

听着 我去增强一下无线信号
不用担心 我就在这儿
鲍尔
请回答
鲍尔 你还在吗?
鲍尔 你还在吗?
我在
我在过滤装置的支路上
嘿 鲍尔...
能听到我吗?

祝你好运 兄弟
等等 有什么不对劲
我早知道不对劲
很久以前就已经这样了
听不清
他们全都...
所有人...
都死了
无价之宝 不可或缺
可ABC 108 他们今天签到了
不止今天 每一次都有签到
我们在系统上看到的
你听到我的话了吗 鲍尔?

那是谎言
整个系统都是谎言?
都是
弥天大谎
再不能相信任何东西了
上帝啊 鲍尔
这里根本没有网络 也没有连接到其他"方舟"
只有我们 还有几台电脑 让我们错以为自己并不孤单
亲爱的 你并不孤单
这种设计 是为了防止我们精神失常吧
鲍尔 你还在吗?
我还能上哪儿去呢?
如果这个系统只是说谎的机器
那我们怎么知道外面还有没有其他人?
我们不知道
我们什么都不知道
也许我们就是硕果仅存的人类
上帝啊
我的氧气快用完了
- 我现在返回

就像你常说的
"只要时间足够久 一切都会改变"
猜猜我在哪找的这把美工刀?
不知道 哪儿?
工具箱里 还在我放的地方
我记得自己把工具箱
搁在了你的维生仓右边 顺手就能拿到
是吗?

是啊 我也不敢相信
所以去检查了一下录像
等一下 我们好好谈谈
不必麻烦了
你真该看看自己这张脸
你已经疯了对吗 伙计?
还是说你真的想杀了我?
让我进去 我们好好谈谈
让你进来?
你已经疯了 不 你现在对我很危险
对休眠者很危险
对整个方舟都很危险
鲍尔 求你了
我这可不是生你的气
不 这话我收回 我对你...

给我个机会解释
机会没有第二回
你就把这当安乐死吧
就像我该为自己家人做的那样
能和你聊天真好 伙计
你上哪儿去?

我在这里
我能上哪去呢 艾比?
呼吸
你来看
你知道让我最心痛的是什么吗?
背叛和谎言
我那么信任你 你居然要对我下手
听好了 外头一无所有 你根本无处可去
要不你还是回来吧?
感觉如何啊?

回答我!
我做到了 艾比 一切都会好起来的
一切都会好起来
卡特莱特?
你在不在?
文森特·鲍尔 你不必如此
我们也许是世界上仅存的两个人了
是吗?
我躺在那儿等死时 你是不是就这么想的?
看你那张小照片的时候呢?
对不起 是我的错
嗯 我们都有错
好了 猫抓老鼠的游戏到此为止
你也知道我不能放过你吧?
我总不能回到维生仓去躺着
等着我最好的朋友在梦中干掉我
卡特莱特!

你不这么做 他就会杀了你
用这个很快 也没有痛苦
为了我们 你一定要动手
你知道我有多难过吗?

我们不是家人吗!

她需要我!
你看 你看!
看你妹!
她需要我 我向她保证过的
听着 听着 我可以解释
原谅我 求你了 她需要我啊 我发过誓的!
艾比 亲爱的 我发过誓 永远不会离开你
永远不离开
你和谁说话?
- 我不会离开你的 艾比

对不起 艾比!
- 我永远不会离开 对不起!

狗娘养的
卡特莱特?
我知道你在这儿 伙计
你他妈当我傻啊?
以为我猜不出来?
至少现在我知道为什么这个白痴工作
对你如此重要了
她一直都在这儿对吧?
你挚爱的妻子?
你不想决定谁死谁活?
哦 这就是结果
卡特莱特
马上出来 我们作个了断
否则我杀了她
你以为我不敢吗?
老子要在她眉心开个洞!
你真应该看看自己那张脸
是我的天堂门票吗?
- 振作点 伙计

好好照顾你的女人
快去吧 伙计 时间不等人
我还活着 艾比

And tonight we embark on the last and most ambitious...
phase of our campaign to end tyranny across the globe.
Mr.

what is the risk to the American population?
Our level of preparedness couldn't be higher.
I am confident that we will prevail, whatever may come.
But, Mr.

Rest assured, my administration is taking steps...
to ensure our way of life will continue.
Mr.

of these so

We're hearing reports of scientists, engineers, doctors...
being whisked away in the night.
Is the government hiding these people in underground shelters?
We have a number of contingency plans in place,
mainly to provide peace of mind.
But let me be very clear.
Our priority is the safety of all the American people.
Sir, are we facing an impending catastrophe?
Is the government deciding who lives and who dies?
Plenty of words from this president but very few details.
And as more time passes with no clear answers...
the situation becomes more dire.
This is Natalie reporting, Channel Nine News.
You having a nightmare, buddy?
Just let me out.

Please.
Goddamn it, Bauer!
Gotta loosen the arm.
Please quit playing around.

Can't do that.
Gradual transition to a normal air mixture prevents what?
Oxygen toxicity.
Which can harm which organs?
Eyes, brain and...
and lungs!
You'd think that somebody that just slept six months...
would be in a better mood.
Why does my tank's cycle take twice as long as yours?
Well, give it enough time,
everything in this dump's gonna break.
- Did you clock in?

Oh, come on.
I just don't want the other facilities to think that we're...
What, dead?

It's not gonna kill you.
How's the weather up there?
Nice day for a picnic?
Outside air toxicity's still in the red.
Just like last cycle and the cycle before that.
I don't know why you check anymore.
All the other facilities have checked in.
Everyone's okay.
Thank my lucky stars.
Oh, not this again, buddy.
No, just a minute.

How many times are you gonna do this?
This piece of crap network wasn't set up...
For direct communication.

Yeah, I wish I had the Internet.
Maybe they'll be better prepared for the next Apocalypse.
Better use the bathroom first, buddy,
if you know what I mean.
Hey, this is not funny.
You don't think it's true?
What isn't true?
They're all dead.
You don't need to remind me.
Today's shopping list.
Look at this.
Man, I've seen that a million times.
I got it memorized.
No, no, no, it says there was some kind of seismic activity.
What?
Yeah, an earthquake.
I know what seismic means.

Oh, this is not good.
Look, if there's any sort of leak down here at all,
this place would be full of poison air from outside.
We'd be dead.

Electrical systems, core structural inspection.
Core structural inspection?
That's a joke.

What about the tanks?
Individual unit diagnostics.
- No way.

You know what?

Those sleepers, yuck, you know they creep me out.
- No.

It's your turn this time.
On three?
One, two, three.
Clock's ticking.

Needed money and I feel So bad
I guess my race is run
But she's the best girl I ever had
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and...
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
Doesn't he drive you nuts?
I've gotten used to him.
I've been dreaming of you.
How's the diagnostics, buddy?
Filter checks are good on all nine levels.
No damage at all from that seismic activity.
What about the tanks?
Still working on them.
Did you tell him about us?
I'm waiting for the right time.
You made a promise.
I'll tell him.
Tell me what?
Who are you talking to?
Nobody.
I hate it when you do that.
Yeah.
I hate when you talk to the sleepers.
I find it creepy.
They're just people.
Yeah, you standing over them, staring at them.
What does that make you?
Sort of a weird pervert?
Look who's talking.

Well, at least I ain't diddling some dead girl, huh'!
She's not dead.
She's waiting, like we are.
Hey, don't you compare her to me.
I work for a living.
What do they do?
Come on, you know they're important.
Important, huh?
What, this guy right here?
"Herpetology."
What's that?

Reptiles and amphibians.
Heh.

These people are seeds, Bauer.
The last in the world.
Knowledge and experience that's unique...
Unique and irreplaceable.

You sound like a broken record, man.
They're the future.

Come on, buddy.
Don't give me that crap.
We waste our whole lives down here, in this hole...
so they can survive?
I understand how you feel.
Doesn't it mean anything to you?
Working down here?

Saving the future of humanity?
Come on.

change a light bulb, go back to sleep.
Rinse and repeat, buddy.
Doesn't it bug you just a little bit?
No.
You know we got the short end of the stick down here, right?
What are you going to do about it?
Complain to management?
Yeah, I might.
I think I'll write a letter.
You do that.
A gorgeous afternoon for baseball.
And we do wanna remind everybody
who's out here enjoying the game...
that these teams are donating all
the proceeds of tonight's ticket sales...
to the relief effort after last week's bombing in Europe.
So we thank everybody for their support at this terrible time.
"Probabilistic calculation of Air Pollutant Dispersion." Bingo.
What's that?
Little light reading for the crapper?
Hmm. "This equation can be used to calculate time remaining..."
until viable surface re

- Ball two.

- Pitcher's a little bit shaky.

"Parameters are, cross wind dispersion...
"concentration of pollutant, horizontal deviation," right?
- Right?

in this guy's eyes right here.
"Optimal scenario for re

But this figure may deviate upwards of 150 years."
- Did you hear that?

You've watched the game 100 times.
Here it comes, here it comes.
And there it goes!
I'm saying we might not be stuck down here for much longer.
Yeah, just another hundred years, right?
Blink of an eye.
Says here it could be as little as 20 more shifts
Buddy, that's for a weather forecast...
which is 50 percent right 10 percent of the time.
But you just keep on reading, all right?
We interrupt your regularly scheduled programming
...to bring you this important news.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

We've just received confirmation of
a series of explosions around the world.
Buddy, it's your move.
Major cities such as Munich, Tokyo,
London and Brisbane were targeted.
What's it gonna be, Mr.

Reports are coming from reliable sources from inside the government.
May not be official, but...
Now this isn't official,
but we're hearing that these attacks could be...
similar to the hybrid nuclear and chemical weapon
that devastated Tel Aviv earlier this year.
The president has now raised military readiness to DEFCON One
which is the highest threat level this country has ever been in.
There you go.
You got six more months to regret that move.
Wait.

Nope.

- You check these diagnostics?

Just about to make our sleep cocktails.
Good.

Back to sleep?
That's the routine.
We'll be together soon.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
I tell myself that every time.
My brain knows it.
But my body tells me that
I'm about to climb into a high

Have you forgotten already?
Please, Abby, I've got work to do.
Think of how good it would feel...

Oh, no, no, no...

Bauer!

What the fuck?
I need the fire extinguisher, please!
Not a good time, buddy!
Open the door!

I need the fire extinguisher!

You didn't have to rip it apart.
Yeah, well, I thought it would help.
That's not right.
Hey, you were responsible for checking the diagnostics!
Hey.

- Let me see it.

Oh, come on.

How'd you get that?
From your stupid tank.
How am I supposed to take care of myself now'!
Use the other hand.
What if I need two hands?
Shit, we're out of air.
I don't know what we're breathing.
There's not much left of it.
Come on, what does that thing say?
One second, one second.
Bingo. "Emergency release via Safety Reserve Cylinders."
Here, let me see.
Aah.

Looks like we gotta go up the Airway Routing Chamber.
Come on, it's not any harder than getting in your tank.
Exactly.
Did the book say where it is?
Somewhere in this jury

Why don't you check over there?
Wai!

No, don't touch that one.
Reds the air outside.
Hey.
Found it, over here.
Emergency air and power supply.
Yeah, here.
Is it working?
Shh.

Save your air.
It's not working.
Still nothing.
I had a wife.
What?
Three little girls.
I thought "unmarried" was one of the job requirements.
I lied...
to get the job, you know.
Who knew all this end

Before they locked the doors.
Can you imagine what it was like for them up there?
I'm sorry.
I had about a minute.
I could've gone up, been with them.
And they sealed us in.
There's nothing you could have done.
You don't understand.

I can imagine.
No, you can't.
It's just you and me now.
We're a family.
Reserved air just kicked in.
Time to make our next move.
Let's go, clock's ticking.
Where the hell are they?
It doesn't say.
Maybe you're looking in the wrong section or something.
"Deep Sleep Vessel, Service and Replacement Instruction," right here.
Man, I told you this is a half

They don't even have spare parts for us.
No, the parts are down here somewhere.

You see, this is what happens
when you slap things together at the last minute!
This is not the only storage room.
Man, I know every inch of this place.
This blueprint isn't gonna help you.
Long

It's just a load of crap for when the sleepers wake up.
We're not maintaining that area.
What are those numbers for?
I don't know.
It should be safe, right?
It should be, it's within the main seal.
The only reason it's blocked off is to save oxygen.
I bet the spare parts are in there.
All right.
No second chances.
All right.
This place is creepy.
- It's like a cave or something.

Scared, buddy?
Just feeling a little claustrophobic, that's all.
Cut it out.

What was that?
Maybe it's an animal or something.
How?
There hasn't been any oxygen in here.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Come on, let's try this door right here.
Come on.
Hey, Bauer, what's this?
That's a Jacuzzi.

What are these cameras for?
They don't show up on our monitors.
That's the old security system.
Watch out for Commies.
Do you think any of these still work?
No.

- I'll start over here.

All right, bingo.

Abby, Abby, Abby.
Bauer!

I found it.
Oh, yeah.
All right, I think it's ready.
What do you mean, think?
I'm ready for bed.
I should go in first, just in case something happens.
Nothing's gonna happen.

- Did we?

Jump in.

Let me just check something.

Fine.
I'll pinch hit.

No, I should do it.

The sooner we do this, the sooner we get some sleep.
Sure about this?
Yep.
If anything seems off, just give a sign.
- Zip me up.

- Ready?

Hey!
Yeah, what?
You hear that?
I don't hear anything.
Sounds like a leak.
- Really?

And the air is definitely getting thinner in here.
- You sure?

Check the air pump.
Okay, let me check.
Cartwright?
Hey, let me out of here.

I'll check it myself.
Cartwright!
Cartwright!
Cartwright!
Bauer'.
I'm so sorry.
My God, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

Where were you?

I was right here!
What happened?
I couldn't get the tank open!
So I was looking for something to cut it.
What took you so long?
I just told you.

What happened to the tank?
I don't know.
Maybe I missed something.
You missed something.
It was an accident.
It would've been so convenient for you, huh'!
One tank between the two of us.
All your problems solved.
That's crazy!

I was supposed to be in there!

- Did I?

Remember?
I did.

- I'm sorry.

This might be a stupid question, do we have parts for that?
I don't know.
And that's all the reserve air we got.
All right, change of plans.
All right.
Which one looks good?
Good for what?
All right, maybe not that one.
What about this guy right here? "Ichthyology."
I don't even know what that means.
We can't just open one of the tanks and put me inside.
Yeah, why not?
What about the person who's already in the tank?
What happens to him when we pull him out?
Well, I guess we kill him.
What?
The only reason why we're here is to keep these people alive.
They're the last remnants of human civilization.
Fuck them.
We can't just decide who lives and who dies!
You know what we can do?

No, you know what?

That's what families do.
Now, you need to pick one right now.
All right.
All right.
Morphine, good idea.

Give him a heavy dose while he's still inside.
Don't do this.
What choice do I have?
There's another way.
We don't have time.
It's as simple as ABC.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
- I can't do this.

No, I'm not doing this.
Fine.

Listen, listen, listen, there's another way.
Look, I know this breaks your soft little heart...
but sometimes you've gotta sacrifice
a pawn to stay in the game.
Don't let him.
I said, I'm not doing this.
Don't you wanna live?
It's murder.
We're techs, Bauer, not murderers!
Come on.
What happens if they find out through the next facilities?
Take a look around, man.

It's not murder, it's survival.
Listen, we have an obligation to keep these people alive.
You're a piece of work, man, you know that?

Did you feel that?
That's what it's going to feel like
when the air runs out down here.
Your lungs starving for oxygen and there isn't any.
Look, someone's gonna die, I'm sorry.
But you are not leaving me here alone.
Please, don't do it.
You'll thank me later.
That's enough.
What are you gonna do with that?
Huh?

Go ahead, cut my throat.
- Solve all your problems.

Try to save a guy's life and he kicks you right in the nuts.
You don't understand.

No, you don't Understand.
These people, they got their ticket to the future...
by stepping on people like you and me!
You wanna trade your life for one of theirs?
I told you, I have an idea.
Now are you with me or what?
Yeah.

What are friends for, right?
Man, I don't know.
But the codes match.
ABC 108 here.
And ABC 108.
I'm telling you, there's another facility, right here,
next to us.
Maybe.
Come on.
It's too dangerous, man.
We don't even know what's out there.
They checked in.

There are people in that facility with spare parts.
You're gonna have to break the red seal.
- Okay.

This facility's a fragile bubble.
One wrong thing and this whole place
fills up full of contaminated air.
Then instead of just killing one of them, we all die.
We'll just have to make sure nothing happens.
Can you hear me?
All right.
- Bauer...

Good luck, all that.
- Oh, shit!

A dead body.

Ours or theirs?
I can't tell.
Lucky he didn't shoot out the airlock door.
Better luck in the next life.
Come on, buddy, you're wasting air.
I'm waiting on the air filters.
Okay.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Okay.
Find anything good out there?
Just dust.

Yeah, that's the airborne contaminant.
You got 31 minutes left, buddy.
If you're not back soon, I'll see you in six months.
Trying to move people as quickly as possible...
but there are rumors that these public shelters are not safe...
against these chemical weapons.
Oh, hey.

Yeah, I see you on one of the monitors.
You're right, those old cameras still work.
Give me a thumbs

All right, cool, keep moving.
All right,
I'm just trying to figure out where the hell you're going.
I think I've found it.
Oh, you were right.
It's stuck.
Come on, you big sissy.

I'm in.
All right, say hi to the ABC people for me.
- Bauer?

I think we got a problem.
It's not working.
Did the green light come on?
No, nothing's working.
Looks like you're locked out, buddy.
Hello!

Hey, stop, stop, you're wasting air.
Well, I was hoping somebody could hear me.
Oh, shit, what do we do now?
Sit tight, buddy, I'm working on it.
Don't give up.
What if he's right?

You've always found a way for us.
I'd lose my mind without you.
Hey, buddy.
I think I found a way around it
but you're not gonna like it.
Just tell me.
Back the way you came, about ten yards.
What am I looking for?
You'll know it when you see it.
- You're joking.

There's no room up there.
Come on, buddy, I've crawled through
the exact same air ducts in our place.
If I can do it, you can do it.
Is there any other way?
Well, if you want those guys to help you,
that's your way in.
Come on, it's a good way to cure your claustrophobia.
All right.

I'm coming to an intersection.

Left takes you back here, so go right,
right into their main ventilation system.
Oh.

You okay, buddy'?
Yeah.
This place is full of dead people.
Which way are they headed?
Are they facing the same direction you're going?
I can't tell.
The good news is, they didn't break in.
What?
If they died out there,
then the main ventilation system is still sealed.
Hey, you do not want to throw up in your mask.
Thanks for the advice.
I got another idea.

Join that little yard sale they got going on down there.
Go to hell, Bauer.
Bauer...
the main filter?
What?

- I said, can I bypass the main filter unit?

- Answer me'

Look, I'm gonna try to boost our radio signal.
Don't worry about it.

Bauer,.
Answer me.
Hey, Bauer, are you there?
Bauer, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
I'm at the fitter bypass.
Hey, Bauer.

Do you hear me?

Good for you, buddy.
Wait, something's not right.
You're telling me.
This must have happened a long time ago.
You're breaking up.
They're all...
They're all...
dead.
Unique and irreplaceable.
They were checked in today, ABC 108.
They checked in today and every other time.
We saw it on the system.
Do you hear me, Bauer?

It's a lie.
The whole system?
All of it.
It's a lie.
Can't trust anyone anymore.
My God, Bauer.
There's no network.

Just us and some computer telling us that we're not alone.
You're not alone, my love.
It's designed to keep us from losing our minds.
Bauer, are you there?
Where else would I be?
If the system is a lie, automated...
how do we know if there's anyone else out there?
We don't.
We don't know anything.
We might be the only ones left alive.
My God.
I'm running low on air.
- I'm on my way back.

As you always say,
"Give it enough time, everything's gonna break."
Guess where I found this?
I don't know, where?
In the toolbox, where I put it.
And I remember putting the toolbox...
right next to your sleep tank, within easy reach.
Okay, so what is your point?
Yeah, I couldn't believe it either...
so I checked the video recording.
Just a minute, let's talk about this.
Don't bother.
You should see the look on your face.
You going nuts, buddy?
Or did you really try to kill me?
Just let me in.

Let you in?
You have gone nuts.

You're a danger to the sleepers.
You're a danger to this whole facility.
Bauer, please.
It's not like I'm mad at you.
No, I take it back.

Give me a chance to explain what happened.
No second chances.
Think of it as a mercy killing...
like I should have done with my family.
Nice chatting with you, buddy.
Where you gonna go?

I'm here.
Where am I going, Abby?
Breathe.
Just look.
You know what hurts the most?
The betrayal and the lies.
I trusted you.

Look, there's nothing out there.

Why don't you come back here?
How does it feel, knowing you're gonna die out there, huh?
Answer me!
I made it, Abby.

Everything's gonna be okay.
Cartwright?
Did I get you?
Vincent Bauer, you don't have to do this.
We might be the only ones left alive.
Yeah?
Is that what you were thinking when I was laying there dying?
When you were looking at your little photo?
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.
Yeah, we both did.
All right, enough of this cat and mouse crap.
You know I can't let this go, right?
Go lay back down in my tank...
see if my best friend's gonna kill me in my sleep?
Cartwright!

If you don't do this, he'll kill you.
It'll be quick.

You have to do this for us.
You know how much this hurts me?

We're supposed to be family!

Yes, she needs me!
Look, look!
Goddamn it!
She does.

Look, look, listen, I can explain everything.
Look, please understand.

Abby, honey, I promise I'll never leave you.
I promised I'd never leave you.
Who are you talking to?
- I'll never leave you, Abby.

I'm sorry.

- I'll never leave you, I'm sorry!

Son of a bitch.
Cartwright?
I know you're in here, buddy.
You think I'm stupid?
Think I wouldn't figure it out?
At least now I know why this stupid job
is so important to you.
She was here all along, huh?
Your lovely wife?
You didn't want to decide who lives and who dies?
Well, that's what it's come to.
Cartwright.
Come out here right now, we'll end this.
I'll kill her.
You don't think I'll do it?
I'll punch a hole right between her eyes.
You should see the look on your face right now.
My ticket to paradise, huh?
- Come on, man.

Take care of your girl.
Go on, man, the clocks ticking.
I'm alive, Abby.
But...

Keeping this place functional.
Talking to myself.
Sleeping in the bed of the man I killed.
Just me now.
And time.
Abby.
