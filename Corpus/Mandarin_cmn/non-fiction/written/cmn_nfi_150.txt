我知道你不高兴 拉波奇卡 I know you're upset, Lapochka.
但这是为了大家好 But this is for the best.
我们都知道你在舞蹈时 We both know that the pain in your movements
疼痛越来越明显了 is starting to show.
疼我能忍得了 The pain I can take.
我受不了的是你 It's you I can't stand.
地球上每个人都知道 Every human being on this earth
人生就是伴随着疼痛的 knows that life is not without pain.
对我们大多数人来说 For most of us,
疼痛会带来不便 我们都竭尽全力避免它 it's an inconvenience, a trial to be endured or avoided.
但也有少数人追求痛感 But there are a select few who seek it out,
他们利用疼痛创造美丽 who use it as a tool to create something so beautiful
美到超越这个世界 并使他们永垂不朽 that it transcends this world and makes them immortal.
舞蹈演员更换 Company change!
十分钟后开始第二幕 Ten minutes to act two!
看到伊娃了吗 Have you seen Eva?
不在她的更衣室吗 She's not in her dressing room?
没有 还有七分钟就该她的个人表演了 No.

看起来你的新宠儿怯场了 迪米特里 Looks like your new princess got cold feet, Dmitry.
我相信唯一能杀死我们的武器 I believe that the only thing that can kill us
就是把我们变成这样的东西 is the weapon that made us this way.

我想找一位女士 I'm trying to find a woman
她可能在纽约某家医院上班 who may have worked for one of the New York hospitals,
是位护士 大约是1985年的 A nurse, circa 1985.
她是我妈妈 She was my mother.
很抱歉 先生 如果想查询员工档案 Oh, I'm sorry, sir, but to access employee records
我们需要正式申请 由警方 we need a formal request from the police
或验尸官办公室签署都行 or the medical examiner's office.
我等会再打过去 Uh, listen, I'll call you back.
亚伯拉罕 你在跟谁通电话 Abraham, who was that?
没谁 Ah, nobody.
你有什么在瞒着我 You're hiding something.
她叫什么名字 What's her name?
被你发现了 You got me.
可能你会很惊讶 You know, this may come as a shock to you,
但有些人在晚上 but some people prefer to spend their evenings
更喜欢有红袖添香 in the company of the fairer sex,
而非离群索居 not locked away in solitude.
再说了 你在楼下干什么呢 What have you been doing downstairs, anyway?
我在读关于...

真是很有趣的课题 Truly a thrilling subject.
因为要拿瓶水我才出来的 I only tore myself away to get a bottle of water.
那我就不打扰你了 Well, I'll let you get to it, then.
准备好了吗 Are you ready?
不知道要吃什么 I'm not sure what to expect here.
相信我 你会喜欢的 Trust me, you'll like it.
好吧 Okay.
天哪 那是 Oh, my god, that's, um

每咬一口 你都会觉得 With each bite, you'll swear
自己漫步在塞维利亚的街道上 you were on the streets of Seville.
那我就按你说的想吧 Well, I'll have to take your word for it.
我从没去过那里 I've never been there.
-从没旅游过

我刚好认识个人 他有架飞机 I happen to know a man with a plane.
你想带我去西班牙 You want to take me to Spain?
不一定要去西班牙 Doesn't have to be Spain.
闭上眼睛 Just close your eyes,
在地球仪上随便指个地方 我们就去那 point at a spot on the globe, and we'll go.
我听过这种伎俩 You know, I have heard of schemes like this

有钱的富翁想要赢得女孩的芳心 rich millionaire men trying to whisk a girl away
花大钱 发挥魅力 using his money and charm

别忘了长相 我长得可是很帅 And my good looks.

你得承认 听起来很诱人 不是吗 You got to admit, it does sound tempting, doesn't it?
抱歉 Sorry.
汉森 出什么事了 Hanson.

我马上就到 I'll be right there.
你又要为了一具尸体抛弃我了 You're ditching me for another body?
至少是尸体的一部分 Well, part of one, at least.
抱歉这么晚还叫你来 Sorry to call you so late,
但我猜像你这样的人 but I figured a guy like you
不会想错过看芭蕾的机会 wouldn't want to miss a chance to go to the ballet.
你还真了解我 You know me well.
希望艾萨克没有因为你离开而太失望 Hope Isaac wasn't too upset that you left.
你怎么知道我和艾萨克在一起 How did you know I was with Isaac?
让我猜猜 你闻到他的古龙水了 Let me guess

不是 只是 你看起来很高兴 No, it's just, uh, you seem happy.
看到你心情好我也很愉快 It's nice to see you in a good mood.
直觉告诉我不会高兴得太久 Something tells me it's not going to last.
媒体怎么来得这么快 How'd the press get here so fast?
他们很多人都坐在观众席 Oh, a bunch of 'em were in the audience,
报道这名要退役的芭蕾舞演员 covering the retirement of this ballerina,
她叫奥德萨·科兹什么的 Odessa Koza

科兹洛娃 Kozlova.
乌克兰人 35岁 荣获首席称号的 Ukrainian, 35, one of 12 living ballerinas
十二位芭蕾舞女演员之一 to be given the title of prima.
在芭蕾界 这相当于女王的地位 It's the equivalent of being a queen.
死啊 女王陛下的告别演出 Yeah, well, her majesty's farewell performance
因为发生这档子事戛然而止了 came to a screeching halt when this thing showed up.
是谁的有头绪吗 Any idea who it belongs to?
明显是个舞蹈演员的 A dancer, obviously.
从她脚背的弧度来看 And judging by the dome of her foot,
她很有天赋 a rather gifted one.
一米六左右 女性 5'4", female,
从肤色来看 And judging by the skin tone,
我猜她是拉丁裔的 也许是墨西哥人 I'd say that she was of latin origin

或者古巴 Or Cuba?
来见见伊娃·萨尔格斯 Meet Eva Selgas

唯一一个没到场的舞蹈演员 Only dancer who failed to show for the performance.
她的同事说三点左右她离开了排练 Fellow ballerinas said she left rehearsal 'round 3:

但没有告诉任何人要去哪 but didn't tell anyone where she was going.
凶手肯定是在那之后抓住了她 Killer must have nabbed her sometime after that
然后砍下了她的脚 and hacked off her foot.
不是砍 "Hacked" is the wrong word.
伤口呈锯齿状 Serration of the bone suggests
说明凶手用的是某种锯子 that the killer used some kind of saw.
从血液的凝固情况来看 And judging by the blood coagulation,
我猜是在受害者死前锯下来的 I'd say the amputation was made antemortem.
你的意思是脚被锯下来时她还活着 You mean she was still alive when it was cut off?
对 但我我不觉得她遭了很长时间的罪 Yes, but I doubt she suffered long.
弓形动脉被割断后 With her arcuate artery severed,
伊娃肯定几分钟后就失血过多死亡了 Eva must have likely bled to death within minutes.
但我得看到尸体才能确认这一点 But I'd need to see the body to confirm that.
这恐怕有点小问题 Well, gonna be a bit of a problem with that.
我们还没有找到尸体 We haven't found it yet.
我们把现场的血迹 We compared the blood at the scene
和伊娃病历做了对比 to Eva's medical records.
那只脚绝对是她的 The foot was definitely hers.
通知她的家人了吗 Have we notified her family?
我们在想办法 但是移民局 We're trying, but I.

很难确定他们在哪里 a tough time tracking them down.
原来伊娃是从埃尔塞罗来的 Turns out Eva's from El Cerro.
是哈瓦那最糟的贫民窟之一 It's one of the worst slums in Havana.
芭蕾演员的出身居然是这样也够奇怪的 You know, it's a pretty odd background for a ballerina.
不奇怪 应该是令人钦佩 It's not odd.

要离开那样的环境需要很大的决心 To make it out of a neighborhood like that takes determination.
也要很高的天赋 Well, and a whole lot of talent, too.
她本来就要成为第一个 She was about to become the first ever prima ballerina
来自古巴的首席芭蕾舞者 of Cuban descent.
还是没找到她的尸体吗 And there's no sign of her body?
没有 我和所有的剧务 No.

还有她的同事都谈过了 and her fellow dancers.
没人看到什么可疑的东西 Nobody saw anything suspicious.
搜查了整个剧院也没有发现尸体 And a search of the theater turned up empty.
凶手一定是在某个地方砍下了她的脚 Our killer must have cut off her foot in one location,
再丢弃到现场的 then dumped it at the scene.
那是其中一种可能性 That's a one hell of a statement.
有嫌疑人吗 Who are we looking at?
目前为止没有 严格来讲 Well, no one yet

没有尸体就无法构成谋杀案 a murder investigation without a body.
市长已经给我打过两次电话了 The mayor's already called me twice.
他让我们尽快找出凶手 He wants homicide on this.
找不到这女孩的尸体 Until we find this girl's body,
这事就没完 this story is not going to die.
尽力去查 Do whatever it takes.
非凡 不是吗 Extraordinary, isn't it?
是的 我本想用"怪异"这个词的 Yeah, I was gonna go with "Bizarre."
这到底是什么啊 I mean, what is this?
伊娃的脚具备了所有芭蕾舞明星该有的特点 Eva's foot has all the hallmarks of a ballet star.
挫伤的足尖 前端韧带撕裂 Fractured toes, tearing of her anterior ligaments.
从这些刺伤能判断出 She also suffered from tendinitis,
她还患有肌腱炎 judging by these puncture wounds.
注射了某种类固醇 Some sort of steroidal injection,
也许是可的松[肾上腺皮质激素类药] cortisone perhaps.
所有这些被藏在芭蕾舞短裙下了吗 All that to just twist around in a tutu, huh?
是啊 很难相信人们为了艺术会做出什么事 Yes, it's hard to believe what some people will do for art.
1929年 巴黎
亨利 Henry!
很高兴你能在 Glad you decided to come
警察闯入我们聚会前赶到 before the cops broke up our little soiree.
这可不是我想象中的出诊画面 This isn't the house call I was picturing.
你说你病了 You said you were sick.
那是毕加索的主意 It was Picasso's idea.
我们都知道区区一个派对是请不到你的 We knew you would never turn up for merely a party, ah.
如果问我的意见 我觉得很遗憾 Which is damn shame, if you ask me.
这里是巴黎 亨利 This is Paris, Henry.
你应该走出去 逛逛这些热闹的街道 You should be out, wandering these fair streets
身边再带着个漂亮的姑娘 with a beautiful girl on your arm.
我有过一个姑娘 欧内斯特 I did have a girl, Ernest,
不过她为了个迷人的美国小说家离开了我 but she left me for a charming American novelist.
是啊 我差点把她给忘了 Ah, yes, I seem to have forgotten her.
也许你也应该忘了 Maybe you should, too.
别理他 Let him go.
我不会再让你因为和海明威打架 I won't have you spoiling my celebration
而破坏了我的庆祝会 by fighting with Hemingway again.
我们要庆祝什么 What are we celebrating?
我最新的三个作品被展览馆接收了 Three of my latest works were just accepted by the salon.
对于一个乡下农场女来说很不赖吧 Not bad for a provincial farm girl, hmm?
恭喜你 做的太不可思议了 Congratulations!

你可以当做是 Well, you might say I've been
我最近有了特别的灵感 particularly inspired lately, hmm?
失陪一下 Excuse me for a moment.
瓦莱丽 恐怕我该说晚安告别了 Valerie, it's time to say good night, I'm afraid.
瓦莱丽 瓦莱丽 Valerie!

瓦莱丽 能听见我说话吗 Valerie, can you hear me?
她用了多少 都没有呼吸了 How much did she take?

来啊 Come on.
就这样 对了 That's it!

吐出来 吐出来 Out with it, out with it.
好了 That's it.
我已经问过15所医院 Well, I've talked to 15 hospitals,
20所免费诊所 还有40间急诊室 20 free clinics, and 40 EMTs,
都没找到少一只脚的尸体 and not one of them has found a body with a missing foot.
拜托你找到凶手的DNA了 Please tell me you've found some of the killer's DNA.
不幸的是 没找到 Unfortunately, no.
不过我在伊娃的芭蕾舞鞋上找到了些东西 But I did find something else on Eva's ballet shoe

美利奴羊毛纤维 Merino wool fibers.
从纤维的粗糙度和密度来判断 And judging by the coarseness and thread count,
我认为这来自于一种小地毯 I'd say that it was from a rug of some kind.
那可不是我想要的确凿证据 That's not exactly the smoking gun I was hoping for.
不过伊娃的哥哥可能会有更多信息 But Eva's brother may have more information.
汉森找到了他在皇后区的地址 Hanson found his address in Queens.
想不想去实地考察 You up for a field trip?
好的 卢卡斯...

毒性检查报告出来了就告诉我 Let me know when the tox report comes back from the lab.
好的 Will do.
卢卡斯 Ah, Lucas!
如果你来找亨利的话 他刚走 If you're looking for Henry, you just missed him.
不 我是来找你的 Nope, you're the one I wanted.
我想请你帮个小忙 I have a little favor to ask.
是关于一个女人...

和女人的情感问题吗 Oh, trouble with the ladies, huh?
不用怕 Well, fear not.
你来找我就对了 You've come to the right place.
是关于我母亲 I

是的 Yeah.
1985年时她离开了我爸爸 See, she left my pops 'round 1985.
从那之后 她就像消失了一样 And after that, she just kind of vanished.
现在我可能找到了 Now, I think I might have found
她曾经工作的医院 the hospital that she worked at.
但档案室的那个笨蛋 But the schmucks at the records office
不肯给我看她的档案 won't release her employment files
除非法医办公室有人要求查看 unless someone from the O.

所以...

你为什么不找亨利呢 Well, why don't you ask Henry?
失踪人口 被隐藏的档案 I mean, missing

这些对他来说就是周六狂欢夜 sounds like a rocking Saturday night for him.
我忘记说了 Oh, I forgot to mention

不能让亨利知道这件事 Henry must not know about this,
因为我母亲失踪的时候 because, um, when my mother went missing,
那段日子我过得非常灰暗 things got kind of dark, uh, for me, that is.
我不希望让他担心 I just don't want to worry him.
好吧 Right.
只是...

我很想帮你 I want to help you,
但我并不太善于对亨利保密 but I have a lot of trouble keeping secrets with Henry,
因为他会使那种绝地控心术 because he sort of plays those Jedi Mind tricks.
我肯定你也有所体会 I'm sure you've felt them.
好吧 我知道这要求有点过分 Yeah, I know it's a lot to ask.
不过亨利总是 But, um, Henry just always
对你评价非常高 speaks so highly about

他说你是他的得力助手 Calls you his right

亨利真的这么说吗 Henry says that?
当然了 他当然会那样说 O

我...

好吧 我可以帮你打几个电话 Yeah, I can make some calls for you.
她叫什么名字 Uh, what

她有很多名字 Well, she's had a few.
凯伦·琼斯 爱丽丝·史密斯 Karen Jones, Alice Smith.
等等 这些都是别名吗 Wait, what do you mean, like aliases?
这和你爸爸有什么关系吗 Does this have something to do with your dad?
说来话长 It's a long story.
你是什么时候意识到伊娃失踪了 When did you first realize Eva was missing?
她本来应该去我工作的餐厅 She was supposed to meet me for lunch
跟我一起吃午餐的 at the restaurant where I work.
但她没来 But she never came.
我想告诉警方她有危险了 I tried to tell the cops that she was in danger,
芭蕾舞团有人在跟踪她 that

等等 你说有人跟踪伊娃吗 Wait, you're saying Eva had a stalker?
她说过是谁吗 Did she say who it was?
没有 她没说 Oh, no.

她说自己可以解决 She

看起来她的确那么做了 By the looks of things, she did.
伊娃的健身包里 Eva was carrying a can
放了一瓶防狼喷雾 of pepper spray in her gym bag.
好像已经用了一半了 It appears to be half empty.
可能她最近和跟踪她的人起了争执 Perhaps she had a recent run

这是伊娃的车吗 Is this Eva's car?
是的 Yes.
她失踪那天是开着这辆车吗 Was she driving it the day she went missing?
是的 Yes.
亨利 你有什么发现 Henry, where are you going with this?
当今汽车里的地毯 The carpet in cars nowadays
都是用合成材料做的 is made of synthetic materials,
但是这种老爷车里的地毯 but the carpet in classic cars is made
都是用百分百天然纤维做的 of 100% natural fiber,
就像我们在伊娃鞋上找到的羊毛 like the wool we found on Eva's shoe.
如果我们找到那辆车 If we find that car

可能就会找到伊娃的尸体 We may find Eva's body.
泊车管理局发现 Parking authority found it
这辆车被丢弃在布朗克斯区的路边 abandoned this morning on a curbside in the Bronx.
汽车内室似乎被清理过了 Interior appears to be clean,
不过你们看这个 but check this out.
看这滩血 Look at this pool of blood.
血迹太小了 The stain is too small.
当杀死伊娃的凶手切下她的双脚时 When Eva's killer cut her foot off,
血应该会涌出来 除非 it would have been gushing with blood, unless...
除非什么 Unless what?
除非她把血止住了 Unless she stopped the bleeding.
杀死伊娃的凶手把她放在后车箱 Eva's killer put her in the trunk
要么认为她已经不省人事 believing that she was either
或是认为她已经死了 unconscious or perhaps even dead.
但她却是清醒的 But she was awake.
地毯上的橡胶管已经被撕下 The rubber tubing has been torn off this carpet.
她肯定是扯下来当止血带了 She must have ripped it out to make a tourniquet.
等等 医生 你是说 Wait, Doc, are you saying

我们的受害者可能还活着 Our murder victim might still be alive.
嫌疑犯调查得怎么样了 Where are we with suspects?
我们现在要去斯图勒中心 Well, we're heading over to Stuhler Center now.
伊娃的哥哥说芭蕾舞团里 Eva's brother said she was being stalked
一直有人在跟踪她 by someone at the ballet.
我认为我们该去一趟那里 Figure we head over there,
和一些人谈谈 看看是否能搜捕到凶手 talk to some people, see if we can flush 'em out.
很好 与此同时 Good.

州立警局正在集结搜索队 State P.

但是他们要搜索的范围很大 but they've got a lot of ground to cover.
如果知道确切的着手点 那就太好了 It would be nice if they knew exactly where to start.
亨利正在调查 相信我 Well, Henry's on it, believe me.
车胎的泥土显然混合有粉土与粘土 Dirt in her tires appears to be a mixture of silt and clay.
车胎下的草似乎是穿心莲品种 Grass under the tires seems to be of the paniculata variety.
这话究竟是什么意思 What exactly does that mean?
这里肯定有些什么能告诉我们 There must be something here that can tell us
袭击伊娃的人的弃尸地点 where Eva's attacker dumped her body.
我们只剩下几个小时 We only have a few hours left.
时间非常重要 Time is of the essence!
卢卡斯 有时间吗 Lucas, you got a minute?
-没有

刚刚收到圣提摩西医疗组 Uh, a bunch a files came for you
送来给你的一大堆文件 from St.

你得签收这些文件 You have to sign for them.
医务文件 是什么文件 Medical files?

那可能是搞错了 Oh, that's, uh, probably a mistake.
文件不是给我的 总而言之 T

我会去搞清楚的 I'll, uh, I'll figure this out.
失去伊娃这么有才华的舞者实属憾事 It's a terrible thing to lose a talent like Eva.
一位总监一生中能遇见这样的舞者 A director is lucky if he sees a dancer like this
一位 也许两位 都是件很幸运的事 once, maybe, twice in a lifetime.
每个跟她共事过的人都很喜欢她 Everyone she worked with adored her.
看来不是每个人 Well, apparently not everyone.
我们认为可能有人跟踪伊娃 We believe Eva may have had a stalker.
你知不知道剧院里是否有人心存嫉妒呢 Do you know of anyone at the theater that may be jealous?
全公司上下没有一个女孩不嫉妒伊娃的 There isn't a girl in the company who wasn't jealous of Eva.
她本来将取代奥德萨·科兹洛娃 She was replacing Odessa Kozlova
成为首席舞者 as the next Prima.
她要取代奥德萨吗 She was replacing Odessa?
我们听说奥德萨要退出舞台了 We heard that Odessa was retiring.
损害 练习 The injuries, the

这些开始给奥德萨带来伤害 they were beginning to take its toll on Odessa.
公司认为最好把首席的位置 The company thought it would be best
交由伊娃来接棒 to pass the mantle on to Eva.
奥德萨对此作何感受 How did Odessa feel about that?
她很难过 这是很自然的事 Well, she was upset, naturally.
但是想想她会做出这种事 But to think that she would do something like this
这是不可能的 is impossible.
伊娃失踪时 她一整天都在排练 She was at rehearsal the entire day Eva went missing.
再说了 我从没听说她威胁过伊娃 Besides, I never heard her threaten Eva.
她们几乎没说过话 They hardly even spoke.
你敢跳 就等死吧
看来奥德萨找到了 Looks like Odessa found
另一种方法来传达她的话 another way to get her message across.
奥德萨能进到这个化妆间吗 Did Odessa have access to this dressing room?
能 Yes, she did.
你觉得像奥德萨这样一本正经的小芭蕾舞女王 You think a prim little ballet queen like Odessa's
有能力切下一个女孩子的脚吗 even got the power to cut off a girl's foot?
每位女王都有自己的心腹 Well, every queen has her henchmen.
一看就知道是俄罗斯黑手党 Russian mob, by the looks of it.
看看他 Check out that one.
双眼几乎肿到睁不开 His eyes are almost swollen shut.
过敏季节吗 Allergy season?
不 是辣椒喷雾造成的 No, pepper spray.
伊娃对跟踪她的人 Eva unloaded half a can on the guy
喷了半瓶喷雾 who was supposedly following her.
不接受签名 No autographs.
其实我们想采访一下 Oh, actually, we were hoping for an interview.
你们可能认为这是退役 You may call it retirement.
但是当芭蕾总监让一个来自贫民区 But when a ballet director replaces you
而且几乎无法踮著脚尖旋转的女孩 with some girl from the slums
来取代其位置时 who can barely spin on her toes.
我认为这是一种侮辱 I call that an insult.
我认为这是杀人动机 Yeah, well, I call it motive.
只有你这么漂亮的女孩才不想弄脏自己的双手 Only a pretty girl like you didn't want to get her hands dirty,
所以你去找了你的朋友塞奇 So you went to your pal Sergei.
你的记录相当惊人啊 Your record is pretty impressive.
抢劫 勒索 故意伤人罪 Robbery, extortion, aggravated assault.
像你这种恶棍怎么会 So, what the hell is a thug like you doing
和一群芭蕾舞演员混在一起 hanging out with a bunch of ballerinas?
我和我的同事是奥德萨的 My colleagues and I are investors
职业投资者 in Odessa's career.
我给她请舞蹈教练 We pay for her dance coaches,
支付她的生活费用 her living expenses

而作为回报 你们收取她的一部分工资 And in return, you take a portion of her earnings.
但是在伊娃取代她的位置之后 But all that money was about to go away
就再也没钱拿了 when Eva took her job.
你切下伊娃的脚留在后台 You chopped off Eva's foot,
给其他舞者一个警告 and then you left it at that ballet as a warning.
我从未碰过伊娃 I never touched Eva!
距离已经近到让她喷你辣椒喷雾了 You got close enough for her to pepper

你肯定已经跟踪了她一段时间 You must have been following her for a while,
等着绑架她的合适时机 waiting for that perfect moment to kidnap her.
他从未想过要绑架她 He was never trying to kidnap her.
他只是在监视她 He was only watching her.
在俄罗斯 这是老把戏了 It's an old trick in Russia.
雇人远距离跟踪 You hire a man to follow from distance,
留下一些威胁的话 leave a few threats.
突然间 舞者就被搞得心烦意乱 Suddenly the dancer gets distracted.
我只是想让伊娃出错 I was just trying to make Eva slip up.
但是我告诉过塞奇绝对不许碰她 But I told Sergei never to touch her,
只要跟踪她就行 just to follow.
她失踪的那天 你有跟踪她吗 Were you following her the day she went missing?
有 Yes.
她大约三点结束排练 She left rehearsal around 3:

去了院子里 在某个雕塑下晃悠 went to the courtyard, hung around some statue,
然后走了 and then she left.
而且你却没继续跟踪她 And you didn't follow her?
她已经用辣椒喷雾喷了我一次 She already pepper

我想最好别再跟踪她了 I thought it best to let her go.
而且 外面当时下着雨 Besides, it was raining outside.
让我理理清楚 亨利 Let me get this straight, Henry.
你把我们都拉到这来 You dragged us all the way back out here
就因为那个哥萨克傻蛋说那天下雨吗 just because this Cossack meathead said it was raining?
你们还不明白吗 Don't you see?
伊娃离开工作室时 下着倾盆大雨 It was pouring when Eva left the studio,
然而她却站在外面 and yet she stood outside
在这个雕塑下待了一会 in front of this statue for some time.
亨利 在局里 Henry, we still have two
我们手上有两名合情合理的嫌疑人 perfectly good suspects back at the station.
两人都有动机 两人 Both have motive, both

都是无辜的 Are innocent.
塞奇和奥德萨无法给我们解答 Sergei and Odessa won't be able to tell us where Eva was going
伊娃失踪的那个下午 她的去向或她去见谁 the afternoon she went missing or who she was meeting.
但是这座雕塑也许会有答案 But this statue might.
这就是罗马人所说的"会说话的雕像" It's what the Romans would call a "Talking statue."
在古代罗马 年轻的恋人们 You see, in ancient Rome, young lovers
不允许在公众场所交谈 were forbidden from speaking in public.
所以他们会像这样在雕像里留下纸条 So they would leave notes in statues such as this.
这就解释了排练结束后 That would explain why no one saw her
为什么没人看到她 她要去见她的秘密情郎 after she left rehearsal

享受一下午后的乐趣 for a little afternoon delight.
以P字母开头的名字 Someone whose name starts with a "P."
奥伊斯特贝汽车旅馆六号房 "Oyster Bay Motel, room 6,
下午四点 爱你的P 4:

这个P是谁 Who the hell is "P"?
我们得去一趟奥伊斯特贝汽车旅馆 We got to get to the Oyster Bay Motel.
-安全

我们好像找到了伊娃的脚被切下来的地方了 Guess we found where Eva's foot was cut off.
但是却没有挣扎的痕迹 No other signs of a struggle, though.
还以为她会反击呢 You'd think she'd try to fight back.
她没机会 She never had the chance to.
她的情人埋伏在这里等着 Her lover lay in wait.
她一踏进这扇门 The moment she came through this door
进入这间昏暗的房间 into this darkened room,
他就用这个打了她的头 he hit her over the head with this.
攻击伊娃的人一定把她的抬到了这里 Eva's attacker must have loaded her body up here
然后开车把她带到一个地方抛尸 and then drove her someplace else to be dumped.
你要去哪里 Where are you going?
伊娃的车轮轴里有一根穿心莲 There was a piece of paniculata grass in the wheel well of Eva's car.
而且卡在轮胎缝里的沙子是 And the sand embedded in the tires
以粉土为基底的 was silt based.
袭击者沿着沙滩开 然后停在了...

那里 there.
看看那些海鸥 Look at those seagulls.
它们从来不会这么大一群聚在一起 They never gather in a flock that large.
除非那里有新鲜的食物 Not unless there's fresh food.
伊娃 Eva!
伊娃 Eva!
她还活着 She's still alive!
医生 伊娃什么时候能醒来 Doctor, when can we expect Eva to wake up?
她也许能告诉我们是谁攻击了她 She might be able to tell us who her attacker was.
很难说 It's tough to tell.
从她的图表上来看 I mean, judging by her chart,
我觉得她能活着都是个奇迹了 I'd say it's a miracle she's even alive.
但从你的图表上看不出来的是 What your charts won't show
伊娃有着极强的求生意志力 is that Eva possesses an extraordinary willpower.
她选择活下来 尽管疼痛难耐 She chose to live, despite the pain.
你必须找出干这件事的禽兽 You need to find the monster that did this.
怎么知道那人不会回来再伤害她一次呢 What's to say he doesn't come back and hurt her again?
我们会让警卫片刻不离地守在房间里的 We're going to have a guard posted in her room 24/7,
萨尔格斯先生 Mr.

与此同时 我们想要问您几个问题 In the meantime, there are a few questions that we'd like to ask.
哈维尔 我们有理由相信 Javier, we have reason to believe
伊娃当时是在那家汽车旅馆里见某个人 that Eva was meeting someone at that motel.
你知道她之前有在见什么人吗 Do you know if she was seeing anyone?
不不不 那不可能 No, no, no, that's

伊娃会告诉我的 Eva would have told me.
听着 我明白这个也许...

不 你不明白 No.

当初我们来这个国家时 When we came to this country,
在那个浮艇上漂泊了几日 we drifted on that raft for days
一无所有 with nothing

只拥有彼此 nothing but each other.
你不会对自己那样爱着的人有所隐瞒的 You don't hide things from people you love like that.
这儿有个符合你妈妈的外观描述的人 Here's one that matches the physical description of your mother

67岁 162公分 67 years old, 5'4",
然后...

是非洲裔美国人 African American.
那是最后一个了 That's the last of them.
我猜有可能...

她用了其他的化名 she went under some other alias.
我们可以打电话给医院 向他们要 Well, we could call the hospital and ask
所有符合描述的员工档案 for all the employee files that match the description.
当然了 要做到那一点 Of course, to do that,
我们需要亨利签字 we would need Henry to sign off.
是啊...

是死路一条了 I guess it's a dead end, then.
抱歉 I'm sorry.
听着 希望能安慰到你 Listen, if it's any consolation,
曾经有个女孩一声不吭地离开了我 I, uh, I once had a girl leave me with no explanation.
说实话 好几个都这样 To be honest, I've had a few.
总之 我知道这样没有结果是有多艰难 Anyway, I know how hard it can be to not have closure.
艰难的是 What's hard
想象我妈妈在这种地方 is imagining my mom in a place like this,
用的是某个编出来的名字 under some made

没人过来认领她 No one to claim her.
我甚至不知道有没有人安葬她 I don't even know if there was someone there to bury her.
无论如何 谢谢你帮忙 Anyway, thanks for your help.
您好 是圣提摩西吗 Yes, St.

是的 我是亨利·摩根医生 Yes, this is Dr.

我打电话过来是有个非常特殊的请求 I'm calling with a very special request.
非洲 Africa?
想象一下 Think about it.
在塞伦盖蒂[国家公园]看日落 Sunsets on the Serengeti.
午夜游猎 Midnight safaris.
我们甚至可以一起狩猎大型动物 We could even fit in some big

打猎吗 不要 假如我要度假的话 Hunting?

我要把枪留在家里 I'm leaving my gun at home.
我懂你的意思了 Ah, I see your point.
那找个浪漫的地方如何 What about someplace romantic?
比如巴黎 What about Paris?
在塞纳河街啜饮葡萄酒 Sipping wine on the Rue de Seine.
看埃菲尔铁塔上的烟花 Fireworks over the Eiffel tower.
你可没法拒绝那个吧 Now, how can you say no to that?
不 不是...

只是...

乔 Jo?
乔 断线了吗 Jo, did I lose you?
我得等会再打给你了 You know, I'm gonna have to call you back.
谢啦 Thanks.
假如你在考虑去非洲旅游 If you're thinking about taking a trip to Africa,
我会建议别去坦桑尼亚 I would recommend skipping Tanzania.
他们刚刚爆发了痢疾 They've just had a recent outbreak of dysentery.
不 是艾萨克想带我去度假 No, um, Isaac wants to take me on vacation.
真的吗 Really?
他还真是不浪费时间啊 是不是 Well, he doesn't waste any time, does he?
是啊 我觉得他开始有点不耐烦了 Yeah, I think he's getting impatient with me.
没办法选定旅行地吗 Having trouble narrowing down a place?
不是 只是 事情有点...

事情进展得太快了 Well, they're moving so fast.
然后...

不是 我是担心我喜欢他 No, I

如果这个案子教育了我们什么 If this case has taught us anything,
那就是无论经历了怎样的痛苦 it's that you can live,
你都能活下去 despite whatever pain you're going through.
但是你不能因为害怕受伤 But you can't let the fear of getting hurt
就不对你在乎的人敞开心扉 stop you from opening up to someone you care about.
我都不知道自己现在为什么要烦心这个 I don't know why I'm even worrying about this now.
手上还有案子的我 没法去度假 I can't leave on a vacation with an open case,
而且我们还没看到抓住攻击伊娃的人的希望 and we're not any closer to capturing Eva's attacker.
因此我提议去一趟斯图勒中心 Which is why I propose we head to the Stuhler Center.
伊娃本来要扮演缇丝比一角 Eva was about to take the part of Thisbe
故事源于罗马诗人奥维德的《变形记》
就在即将上演的《皮拉莫斯与缇丝比》中 in the upcoming production of "Pyramus and Thisbe."
我们在雕像上找到的纸条 The note we found in the statue
签名是"皮" 皮拉莫斯 was signed "P"

有理由推断 假如伊娃要演缇丝比 It stands to reason, if Eva was playing Thisbe

那我们就得找到她的皮拉莫斯 We have to find her Pyramus.
皮拉莫斯与缇丝比
更有活力些 More energy!
你们是想让我无聊死吗 Are you trying to bore me?
米勒科夫先生 Mr.

我们能聊一聊吗 Can we have a word?
我们知道您在 We understand you're doing
排演《皮拉莫斯与缇丝比》 a production of "Pyramus and Thisbe."
您能告诉我们谁扮演皮拉莫斯一角么 Would you tell us who is playing the role of Pyramus?
让·瓦雷 怎么了 Jean Valle.

我们得和让谈谈 We're gonna have to speak with Jean.
和伊娃·萨尔格斯有关 It's regarding Eva Selgas.
我知道 他现在有点忙...

伊娃身体欠佳 我们得找个新的缇丝比 With Eva indisposed, we need to find a new Thisbe.
而这些姑娘们可没给我什么信心 And these girls are not doing much to inspire my confidence!
你没事吧 Are you all right?
没事 我只是...

好吧 休息五分钟 All right, take five.
我自己可以了 谢谢 I've got it from here.

换我就不会注射 I wouldn't do that.
还是冰敷一下你的脚踝 Far healthier to ice your ankle
然后休息几天健康多了 and rest for the day.
你回头看看 医生 Look around you, Doctor.
这里没有人在乎健康 No one here cares what's healthy.
我们会为了成为最优秀的付出一切 We do what we have to to be the best.
我现在大概知道 Guess now I know
你新发现的灵感源泉是什么了 the source of your newfound inspiration.
亨利...

谢谢你昨晚帮我 Thank you for your help last night.
但是我不想听你说教 But I could do without the lecture.
我不是想说教 I don't mean to lecture.
我只是想弄明白 I'm just trying to understand.
为什么 为什么你要冒着失去生命 Why?

失去成功的风险 your success?

海洛因 能帮我开发出一些灵感 Heroin, it helps to unlock something in me.

昨晚只是不小心注射过量了 I just overdid it last night is all.
瓦莱丽 Oh, Valerie.
你有天赋 You have a gift
比镇痛药强得多 so much stronger than opiate.
只要你对自己有信心 If you just have faith in yourself,
你能创作出比这还精彩的作品 I know you're capable of works even greater than this.
但我也得继续创作 对吧 I won't unless I get back to work, hmm?
再次谢谢你 Thank you again...
谢谢你做的一切 for everything.
好了 各位 Okay, everybody,
再来一次 从头开始 let's start again, from the top.
汉森 情况如何 Hanson, what's up?
乔 我在医院 伊娃醒了 Jo, I'm at the hospital.

我问了她 去旅馆见谁了 I asked her who she was meeting at that hotel.
你们绝对想不到是谁 You're never gonna guess who it is.
我应该知道了 I think I have a pretty good idea.
这张海报上有最初 This poster features the performers
《皮拉莫斯与缇丝比》扮演者 of the first "Pyramus and Thisbe,"
以及最开始的皮拉莫斯 including the original pyramus.
扮演者
迪米特里·米利克夫 Dmitry Milikoff.
这是你写的吧 This is from you, right?
你留在了雕像上 You left it for her in the statue.
奥伊斯特贝汽车旅馆
我说多少次了 对 是我写的 For the thousandth time, yes, this was from me,
但是一周前写的 but from a week ago.
她失踪那天我们并没有安排 We had no plans to meet the day she went missing.
雕像里的字条 Notes in statues.
城外的汽车旅馆 Motel rooms outside of town.
何必这么隐秘呢 迪米特里 What is with all the secrecy, Dmitry?
是伊娃的主意 It was Eva's idea.
当我宣布下次由她担任首席舞者时 After I announced that she would be next prima,
她很担心如果别人发现我们的事 she was worried that if we were found out,
就会有流言蜚语 there would be whispering

说她被你潜规则了吗 That she was sleeping her way to the top?
我绝对不会伤害她 I would never do anything to hurt her.
我很爱伊娃 I love Eva.
与伊娃亲近 Being close to Eva
给我一种全新的感觉 is unlike anything I've ever felt.
就像 It is like...
与杰作接近 ...being close to greatness.
要是不看着 我根本感觉不到脚没了 If I don't look at it, I don't even feel like it's gone.
你能挺过来实在是太了不起 What it took for you to survive this,
太有意志力 your resolve

令人惊叹 It's amazing.
我们从古巴逃出来 早已懂得 Many of us who escaped Cuba have learned the hard way
有些东西再疼也是值得的 there are some things worth more than any pain.
如果你不介意 If you feel up to it,
能否告诉我们到底发生了什么 would you mind telling me exactly what happened,
你记得什么 as you remember it?
我不知道 I don't know.
记不清了 It was all a blur.
我只清晰记得 The only thing I remember clearly
在后备箱里醒来 was waking up in the trunk...
看到自己的脚不见了 ...and realizing what had been done to me.
仅此而已 That's it, really.
休息一下吧 伊娃 Get some rest, Eva.
你有没有安排帮她剩余的腿部进行截肢 Have you scheduled an amputation for the rest of her leg?
没有 大多数情况下 No.

会需要多截一点 further amputation would be necessary.
但是对她动手的人 But whoever did this to her
对伤口进行了处理 cauterized the femoral artery.
什么 What?
做手术吗 Surgically?
也就是说 对她动手的人 But that would mean whoever it was
并不想杀她 never intended to kill her.
不是迪米特里干的 Dmitry didn't do this!
我们知道 我们刚从芭蕾舞团出来 We know.

安保人员证明伊娃失踪那天 Security guards confirmed that Dmitry
迪米特里在剧院 was at the theater the day Eva went missing.
他没机会去杀她 He didn't have a chance to try and kill her.
凶手并不想杀她 Whoever did this wasn't trying to kill her.
我刚跟伊娃的医生谈过 I just spoke to Eva's doctor.
她的伤口被人处理过 Her wound was cauterized skillfully,
故意留她一命 so she'd live.
或者 让她痛苦 Or, rather, so she'd suffer.
对她来说 没办法跳舞就是最大的折磨 For her, a life without dancing is a fate worse than death.
所以我们要找的人 So, whoever we're looking for
有医学背景 has a medical background of some kind.
芭蕾舞团里的理疗师 A physical therapist at the ballet?
军医呢 How about an army doctor?
伊娃的移民记录送来了 Eva's immigration records came through the other day,
还有她哥哥的 along with her brother's.
我当时看到的时候没想那么多 I didn't think much of this at the time when I saw it, but...
你看哈维尔的职业栏 Check out what it says under javier's occupation.
哈维尔·萨尔格斯 三十岁 Javier selgas, age 30.
曾在古巴军队 Formerly employed by the cuban army
担任战地外科医师 as a battlefield surgeon.
哈维尔·萨尔格斯 纽约警察 Javier selgas.

开门 我们有搜查令 Open up.

我来吧 Allow me.
没人在 不过来看看这个 Place is clear, but check out what I found.
很常见的工具 锤子 十字螺丝头 Just your usual tools, right

还有骨锯 oh, and a bone saw.
-纽约警察 不许动

没地方跑了吧 哈维尔 Nowhere left to run, Javier!
不要 No!
我们从哈维尔家里拿回了骨锯 Well, we recovered the bone saw at Javier's house
以及一些医学用品 along with his medical supplies
还找到了他计划扔下伊娃的路线 and the maps to where he dumped Eva's body.
似乎可以结案了 Looks like a closed case.
还有一件事说不通 One thing still doesn't make any sense.
哈维尔为什么要这样对伊娃 Why would Javier do this to Eva
他们不是一直同甘共苦吗 after everything they went through to get here?
迪米特里说 Well, I mean, Dmitry said
伊娃会拥有最璀璨的未来 that Eva was gonna outgrow everyone.
她当上了首席舞者 maybe with her becoming prima,
哈维尔可能担心会被她抛下 Javier was worried he'd be left behind.
艾萨克 Isaac?
对 我听取了你的建议 Yeah.

我们要去巴黎 We are going to Paris.
太棒了 Fantastic.
何时出发 When?
今晚 Tonight.
更棒了 Even more fantastic.
太好了 Good for you.
巴黎 可以这样描述 Paris is

不论你去任何地方 that wherever you go in the world,
巴黎会跟随着你 Paris stays with you,
因为巴黎是一场移动盛宴 for Paris is a moveable feast.
说得真好 That's beautiful.
是海明威说的 不是我 Well, it's Hemingway, not me.
他确实很会说话 He did have a way with words.
对女人也很有一套 He also had a way with women.
那你是否有私人推荐的必去景点呢 So, what are Henry Morgan's must

我个人看来 In my humble opinion,
在巴黎 最浪漫的事就是迷路 the single best thing to do in paris is get lost.
迷路 Lost?
对 Yes.
醒来 随便挑一个方向 出发 Wake up, start walking in any direction, really,
就会迷路 and get lost.
一直在街上漫步 直到筋疲力竭 Wander the streets until you're so terribly weak
饥肠辘辘 只能找一家最近的餐馆 that you have no choice but to stop at the nearest cafe
吃美味的一餐 and order something wonderful to eat
配着一两杯红酒 along with a glass or two of wine.
之后继续上路 And then set back out into the city.
再次让自己迷路 And do it all over again.
不过这种做法 But know that this regimen works best
只能跟特别的人一起进行 only if done with someone you find very special.
听上去不错 Sounds nice.
好 你俩都在这 Oh, good, I have both of you.
只能有一个留下 More like you have one of us.
乔还要去收拾行李 Jo has some packing to do.
是啊 Yeah.
好吧 Okay.
伊娃脚的实验室最终结果出来了 Got the final lab results on Eva's foot.
一个出乎意料的事是...

-咪唑硫嘌呤

大吃一惊啊 在她血液里发现的 Big surprise.

-是一种

对 你又在...

接你话 对 Finish your sentences?

所以她注射的并不是可的松 So, it wasn't cortisone she was injecting.
可是说不通啊 But that doesn't make any sense.
我需要马上看看那只脚 I need to see the foot.

她没得早发性关节炎 She didn't have early onset arthritis.
她得的是骨质退化 She had a degenerative bone condition.
她只能再跳一年芭蕾了 I'd say she had about a year of dancing left.
她自己也知道 And she knew it.
出院吗 Checking out?
摩根医生 Dr.

如若允许 在下乐意推伊娃出去 If it's all right, I'd be happy to wheel Eva out.
哈维尔的事你听说了吗 You've been told about Javier?
听说了 Yes.
我现在还是很震惊 I'm still in shock about all of it.
不敢相信他已经死了 I can't believe he's dead.
还是觉得他不可能 It still seems almost impossible
会对我做出这种事 to believe he could do this to me.
你不知道为什么吗 You have no idea why?
哈维尔一直认为我 Javier always thought I cared more
重舞蹈轻家庭 about dance than our family.
我想他可能是嫉妒吧 I guess he was jealous.
很奇怪 That seems odd.
哈维尔明显非常关心你 Javier obviously cared very much about you,
他甚至给你注射了咪唑硫嘌呤 he even gave you injections of azathioprine
治疗你的骨病 to treat your bone condition.
你什么时候被诊断的 When exactly were you diagnosed?
一年前 About a year ago.
得知自己奋斗了一辈子终于得到的角色 How terrible to learn you'd have less than a year
仅仅能表演一年的感受 to inhabit a role that
会有多糟 you'd spent a lifetime working for.
还是有疑问 Still, the question remains,
既然哈维尔知道你的职业生涯马上要结束了 why would Javier bother cutting off your foot
为什么还要锯断你的脚 if he knew your career would soon end?
我说了我不知道 I said I

他什么事都能为你做 He would have done anything for you.
或者是对你做 Or I should say to you.
遵循你的命令 哈维尔锯断了你的脚 At your bidding, Javier cut off your foot.
他很爱你又有足够的医术 He loved you enough.

在哈维尔家 At Javier's house,
警察找到了抗生素 the police discovered the antibiotics,
肾上腺素和盐水 the adrenaline sulfide, and the saline solution

特色续命混合物 the perfect cocktail to keep you alive long enough
让你能撑到警察找到你 so that the police could find you.
你让哈维尔锯断你的芭蕾之足 You had Javier drop off your foot at the ballet
保证可以引起媒体的注意 to ensure the attention of the press.
感谢媒体报道 Thanks to the media coverage,
你会一直被定格在 you'll always be frozen in time
本可以成为史上最佳的首席芭蕾舞者 as the prima that could have been the best ever.
历史永远无法忘记你 History will never forget you.
故事讲的不错 摩根医生 That is quite a story, Dr.

非常吸引人 Very dramatic.
接下来的路我自己走 医生 I'll take it from here, doctor.
她耍了我们 耍了我们所有人 She played us.

终身难忘的角色 The role of a lifetime.
等到我们逮捕了她 Well, wait till we arrest her.
她就是史上最疯狂的骗子 She will be known as the craziest fraud that ever lived.
我不确定 I don't know how that's possible.
哈维尔已经死了 我们没有证据证明 Javier is dead, and we have no proof
伊娃设计的这一切 that Eva orchestrated this.
让地检来判 伊娃肯定也是无罪释放 The D.

只能增添伊娃的传奇色彩 And it will only add to Eva's legend

更是正中她的下怀 be more of what she wants.
不行 我不能就这么坐视不管 No, I am not gonna just sit back and

乔 行了 Jo, stop.
我跟你一样生气 I'm as upset about this as you are,
但这事就让它过去吧 but this one, we've got to let go.
而且警探 你不是还要去赶飞机吗 Besides, detective, don't you have a plane to catch?
给我带点可颂面包什么的 Bring me back a croissant or something.
我只是不敢相信 I just

伊娃让自己受了那么多罪 Eva put herself through that much pain.
是为什么 And for what?
我曾认识一个和伊娃有些相似的人 I once knew someone similar to Eva.
永远不要低估一个人能干出什么来去...

永生 To live forever?
巴黎玩的愉快 乔 Enjoy paris, Jo.
兴奋吗 我很兴奋 Excited?

跟你一起去巴黎 太兴奋了 Paris with you

不敢相信我真的要去了 I can't believe I'm actually going.
你肯定要去的 Oh, you're going, all right.
你将以最佳方式 You're going to experience the most romantic city
来体验这世上最浪漫的城市 in the world in best possible way there is to experience it.
真的吗 Really?
我百分百诚意认证 Courtesy of my 100% full proof,
巴黎就是魔法之旅的代言 paris

我把每分钟都计划了 I've got every minute planned,
每顿饭 每口红酒 every meal, every sip of wine.
每分钟 Every minute, huh?
有没有迷路的可能 Any chance of just getting lost?
迷路 Lost?
我绝不会领你迷路的 I would never get us lost.
我会看好你的 姑娘 I got you, girl.
迷路 Lost.
法医办 OCME?
你好 找摩根医生 Uh, yes, we're looking for Dr.

这里是圣提摩西医疗组 This is the St.

圣提摩西医疗组 Oh, St.

你好 抱歉 我就是摩根医生 Yes, I'm sorry.

我有点感冒了 I have a bit of a cold.
注意身体 I'm sorry to hear that.
我们检查了所有的资料 好像找到了 We checked all our files, and I think we've identified
一个前雇员符合你们给的描述 a former employee who fits the description you gave us.
要我把资料给你吗 Shall I give you the information?
当然 谢谢 Yes.

我们生命中有些时刻 There are moments in all of our lives
会让我们扪心自问 when we are compelled to ask ourselves,
为了追寻你要的东西 你愿意付出多少 how far are we willing to go for what we want?
瓦莱丽 我是亨利 Valerie?

瓦莱 Val?
神工鬼斧 Incredible.
我们愿意冒多大的风险 How much are we willing to risk,
去牺牲 去忍耐 to sacrifice, to endure?
因为渴望是一回事 Because it's one thing to yearn for something...
而得到去实现的力量却是另一回事 But quite another to find the strength to achieve it.
你不是已经该上飞机了吗 Shouldn't you be on a plane?
我发现我...

我不想去 I didn't want to go.
什么 去巴黎吗 What?

和艾萨克一起 With Isaac.
我不想和艾萨克一起去 I didn't want to go with Isaac.
为什么 Why?
我不知道 I don't know.
也许我想到...

亨利 Henry.
太好了 你在 Oh, good, you're here.
乔 Hi, Jo.
我得跟你谈谈 I

亚伯拉罕 还好吗 Abraham, is everything all right?
