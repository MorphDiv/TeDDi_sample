AMC台"行尸走肉" 前情提要 Previously on AMC's "The Walking Dead".
他在附近有个营地 He has a camp nearby.
他希望我们能去面试成员资格 He wants us to audition for membership.
这是什么地方?

这是可持续发展的开端 This is the start of sustainability.
我们需要在外闯荡过的人 We need people who have lived out there.
这些还是你们的枪 They're still your guns.
但是在这里 安全起见 我们要收集起来 But inside here, we store them for safety.
大家都说你给了他们工作 Everybody said you gave them jobs.
对啊 都是这地方的一员 Yeah.

这地方会使我们变脆弱的 This place is gonna make us weak.
我们会找到办法的 We'll make it work.
如果他们不行的话...

我们就接管这个地方 then we'll just take this place.
不不 没事 我通常都起床了 No, no, it's cool.

我过去每天给一家咖啡店开门 I used to open for a coffee shop
日复一日 整整七年 every day for seven years.
你的脑子总惦记着 Your brain, it gets wired
你已经不再需要的东西 to things you don't need anymore.
我现在也还习惯随身带着手机 I still like carrying around my cell phone, too.
也许某天 它会突然响起 One of these days it's gonna ring
然后吓我一大跳 and freak my ass out.
嘿 你要是在外面逮着只野猪 我能要条腿吗?

用来做意大利熏火腿的 To make a prosciutto.
在这之前 我常常在我家的地下室里腌肉 I used to cure meats in my basement even before all this.
我腌的菜也很可口 I made some kick

当然 Olivia Sure, Olivia.
谢谢 Thanks.
过来抓我啊 Come and get me.

行尸走肉 第五季第13集
我没看见它 但应该就在附近 I don't see it, but it's close.
只有一只行尸 There's just one of 'em.
我们不宜在这久留 We won't be here long.
那你怎么看?

等里面没人了 我们再进去 We can go in when it's empty.
怎么进呢?

钻窗户 只有一个窗闩 我可以让它一直开着 The window.

- 一个窗闩?

要是哪个蠢货关上了呢?

等上几天 再让它一直开着 Wait a couple of days, leave it open again.
行尸就要来了 It's getting closer.
我们要趁早办好这事 We need to do it sooner than later.
趁现在他们没有监视我们 Right now, they're not watching us.
没有对这样的集会起疑心 Not worrying about meetings like this.
我们或许用得上枪 或许用不上 We may need the guns, we may not.
不管怎样 我们都会用上的 We will whatever way it goes.
他们是我见过的最他妈幸运的人了 They're the luckiest damn people I ever met.
而且还接连不断地走狗屎运 And they just keep getting luckier.
此话怎讲?

我们现在来这了 We're here now.
他们存着一些军用提箱 They've got a couple of footlockers
里面装满了9毫米自动步枪 突击步枪 霰弹枪 just full of 9 millimeter autos, Rugers, Kel

就这么扔在一边 他们用都不用 Just tossed in there.

不会察觉到枪支不见了的 They're never gonna know they're gone.
有人现在就持着抢 对吧?

嗯 Mmm.
听着 我们希望其他人也能尝试 Listen, the others, we want them to try.
你也是 You, too.
所以别太声张 就我们几个知道 So we keep it quiet.

行尸来了 Here it comes.
- 让我来

我们说好带我出来练枪的 We said we were taking me out shooting.
我不能满着弹匣回去 I couldn't go back with a full mag.
好在那行尸来了 Lucky he came by.
我们得回去了 We should get back.
你去打开窗闩 我们择日行动 You'll pull the latch, we'll pick our moment.
我们并不需要狗屎运 Us, we don't need to be lucky.
那是什么玩意儿?

是字母W吗?

是的 Yeah.
我不知道 交给外人掌权 I don't know if this is some kind of play,
是不是在耍什么把戏 handing authority to strangers.
掌管劝架的权力 The authority to break up fistfights.
如果只是这样 她早该安排Daryl干这差事了 If it was just that, she should have given one of these to Daryl.
我不知道这是为了帮我们还是他们 I don't know if it's for us or for them.
又或许Deanna两边都想干掉 Or maybe Deanna's trying to get rid of us and them.
让我俩穿上制服 You put these jackets on me and you,
在大家面前显摆 have the people see it.
要是这样 就是聪明的一招 If that's the play, that'd be smart.
而且她看起来很聪明 And she seems smart.
一直很聪明 还是就眼下聪明?

眼下就是现在 This is now.
出来!

快点!

你能根据声音辨别行尸和人?

那你能辨别好人和坏人吗?

Rick看起来可不擅长这方面 Rick doesn't seem to be an expert at that.
现在已经不重要了 There ain't much of a difference no more.
是你对伙伴的感情也不重要了吗?

你为什么跟踪我?

我没在跟踪你啊 I didn't know I was.
我出来打野兔的 I came out to hunt rabbits.
我知道你出来干什么 I know why you're out here.
介意我加入吗?

跟上 Keep up.
还有小声点 And keep quiet.
你们负责保卫社区 You protect and serve.
你们需要巡逻 站岗 还有照看小孩 You patrol, walk the wall, watch out for the kids.
要是起了冲突 就去劝解 If there's a conflict, you solve it.
然后人们就会听从于你们 And people will listen to you.
因为我们穿着制服?

因为他们相信这一切 Because they believe in this.
因为我让他们相信 Because I'm telling them to.
这里曾住过一名警官 A police officer used to live here.
于是就留下了这些制服 我想正式建立警察系统 So we had these jackets and I wanted to make it official.
现在就正式了 So it's official.
有一天 这里会成立一个政府 There's gonna be a government here one day.
所以我安排Maggie与我共事 That's why I want Maggie working with me.
这里会建立个警察机关 There's gonna be a police force.
所以我让你俩着手此事 That's why I want you two to start it.
我预见这会是个有活力的社区 I see a vibrant community here
有着工业发展 商业贸易 with industry, commerce,
人类文明 civilization.
过着现实生活 Real lives.
或许只有马拉的磨坊 但...

这听起来像是痴人说梦吗?

不像 No.
不像 No.
不像 No.
我们可以谈谈安全问题吗?

我们需要安排巡逻队定时沿墙巡逻 We need a constant patrol along the walls.
不光是检查墙体破损 Not just looking for damage,
还有任何外人翻入的痕迹 but signs that anyone climbed in from outside.
你若这么做 一定深得民心 You can move right up the supports.
换我就会这么做 That's what I'd do.
现在人心不合才是真正的威胁 People are the real threat now.
Rick 我知道你觉得 Rick, I know you think
所有人即使在墙内也要武装 that we should all be armed within the walls.
我...

没事 That's fine.
你负责做这些改动 我们不用插手 You make these changes, we won't need to.
打扰一下 Excuse me.
我自愿去钟塔上望风 I want to volunteer to be one of the lookouts in the clock tower.
钟塔那边没有人望风 There are no lookouts in the clock tower.
- 什么?

那是我儿子Spencer挂在上面的一支空步枪 That was an empty rifle my son Spencer put up there.
他有时会用它 但用得不多 He mans it sometimes, but not often.
听着 一直以来都没这必要 Look, there hasn't been the need.
我们需要有人在那塔上望风 We need a lookout in that tower
立刻马上 全天候的 right now, 24/7.
只有这样我们才能知道有没有外人闯入 It's the only way we'll be able to see if someone's coming at us.
好吧 好吧 制定轮班看守 Okay, okay, we'll make shifts.
我会尽可能去值几个班 I'll take those shifts, as many as possible.
为什么?

Sasha是我们当中枪法较准的 Sasha's one of our best shots.
她能胜任 She can do it.
我今天就让Spencer去值班 I'm gonna put Spencer up there today.
我会考虑让你当这个岗位的负责人 I'll consider you being our primary lookout,
但是我要些东西作回报 but I want something in return.
今晚我会在我家为你们 Tonight I'm hosting a welcome
主办一场欢迎会 for all of you at my home.
我希望你能去 I want you to be there.
为什么?

今晚来吧 我到时告诉你 Come tonight.

利马豆泥 Mashed lima beans,
可可粉 少量甜味剂 cocoa powder, a little sweetener.
在灾难爆发前我就经常吃这个 I would have eaten it before all this, I swear.
富含蛋白质 而且能让你吃饱 It's protein and it fills you up.
听起来很好吃 Sounds delicious.
我回去了 我要去求Rick I'll be back.

给今晚的聚会帮帮忙 for some help with tonight.
如果需要帮忙就来找我 You need anything else, you hit me, girl.
好的 谢谢 Okay, thanks.
你听说了聚会的事了吗?

每个人都会去的 Everyone's gonna be there.
是的 That's right.
那就是今晚 So tonight, then.
应该能溜出去 Should be able to slip out.
军械库就在Deanna家旁边 The armory is right next to Deanna's.
我给你掩护 I'll back you up.
人们也许会奇怪他们的新警官或者Carl的爸爸 People might wonder where their new constable is
去哪了 or Carl's dad.
了解 Okay.
我们不能让Daryl来 We can't use Daryl.
他的一举一动都被盯着 They're watching every move he makes.
没事 It's fine.
你知道这地方有什么好处吗?

我又成了隐形人 I get to be invisible again.
我几个月来都在抓它 I've been trying to catch him for months,
带他回去 bring him inside.
他的名字叫"扣子" His name is Buttons.
有个孩子不久前看到它跑过大门 One of the kids saw him run by the gate a while back.
觉得它看起来像纽扣 Thought he looked like a Buttons.
好久没有看到它了 I haven't seen him for a while.
恐怕已经太晚了 I was afraid it was too late.
每次Eric或者我一靠近 它就受惊 Every time Eric or I come close, he gets spooked.
你以前抓过吗?

我们团队抓过 My group did.
但当时那匹在野外待得不久 But they weren't out there that long.
他们在外待得越久 The longer they're out there,
就越会暴露本性 the more they become what they really are.
我不会伤害你 I ain't gonna hurt ya.
好吗?

来吧 孩子 Come on, boy.
很好 Yeah.
接着吃草 Just keep on eating.
对了 Yeah.
好孩子 Good boy.
你以前有主人 是吗?

现在你是你自己的主人 Now you're just yours.
该死!

快点 他们来了!

快走 Come on.
你真的要用苹果酱代替鸡蛋?

这简直颠覆了我的人生观 That could change my life.
假如咱们不告诉别人 If we can keep that between you and me.
这算是做曲奇饼的秘方 It's sort of the secret to these cookies.
- 没开玩笑?

女孩子总有许多秘密 A girl's got only so many secrets.
我不会告诉别人的 It'll die with me.
巧克力有点麻烦 Uh, the chocolate is kind of a trick.
你真的有巧克力?

我只能给你四分之一块 I can only ration you a quarter bar.
那就够了 I'll make it work.
嘿 Olivia Hey, Olivia.
- 我们来拿点枪

老大让我们在聚会前 Boss lady wants me to check
去检查一下东墙的支撑柱 that strut on the east wall before the party.
去后面吧 Head on back.
Carol 想要什么就拿 Carol, just grab what you need.
- 巧克力在过道的冰箱里

你害怕枪吗 女士?

不 我...

在外面的时候我有一把手枪 well, I had a handgun and I carried a rifle
和一把来复枪 但是我不在行 when we were on the outside, but I'm not an expert.
至少那些枪都用不好 Not with those, at least.
我叫Tobin Well, my name is Tobin.
你想要的话 And whenever you want,
我很乐意教你 I'd be happy to teach you.
安全总比不会用好 Just better to be safe than sorry.
真好 谢谢 Tobin That'd be nice.

谢谢 Olivia Thank you, Olivia.
你会骑马?

我会骑车 I ride bikes.
我猜你说的不是公路自行车 I take it you don't mean 10

我知道你觉得自己被排斥了 I know you're feeling like an outsider.
这不是你的错 It's not your fault, you know.
Eric和我 Eric and I,
在很多方面仍旧被人排斥 we're still looked at as outsiders in a lot of ways.
有不少人善意赞美过我们 We've heard our fair share of well

但是那些很难听的话 but hilariously offensive things
也是出自那些很好的人们 from some otherwise really nice men and women.
人的本性不会变 People are people.
越恐惧 就越愚蠢 The more afraid they get, the more stupid they get.
恐惧冲昏了头脑 Fear shrinks the brain.
他们因为各种原因害怕我们 They're scared of you and me for different reasons.
他们了解我 所以对我恐惧比较少 They're less scared of me because they know me.
而且与日减少 It's less and less every day.
所以你要让他们了解你 So let them get to know you.
今晚你应该去Deanna的聚会 You should go to Deanna's party tonight.
我没有什么可以证明自己的 I got nothing to prove.
在外我遇到了太多坏人 I met a lot of bad people out here
他们做了太多坏事 doing a lot of bad shit.
他们不害怕任何东西 They weren't afraid of nothing.
他们害怕 Yeah, they were.
天啊 Oh, my.
欢迎 Welcome.
嗨 Hi.
真高兴见到你们 Oh, it's so good to see you.
嗨 Carl 谢谢你能来 Hi, Carl.

我都没机会采访这个小家伙 You know, I didn't get a chance to interview this one.
- 我真嫉妒她

她会见证这地方将来的样子 She'll get to see what this place will become.
来吧 请进 Come.

我不习惯这种地方 I don't know about this.
他们有啤酒 They have beer.
我去尝尝 I'm gonna try.
你是Rick You're Rick.
Rick 这是我的丈夫Reg Rick, this is my husband Reg.
你是个很卓越的人 You're a pretty remarkable guy.
这话怎么说?

我看了录像带 所有的 I watched the tapes.

那些人怎么评价的你 The things those people said about you.
你为他们做的事 The things you did for them.
外面的墙是你造的吗?

是的 大家帮我一起造的 Yeah, I did, with help.
我建造了大部分 这是个了不起的成就 A lot of it.

但不过是一堵墙 But it's a wall.
比起在这末世维持14个人的生命?

我觉得你打败我了 I think you have me beat.
我们正站在这堵墙后面 亲爱的 Well, we're standing behind that wall right now, dear.
所以你们是平手 So let's call it a tie.
很高兴你能来 Well, I'm glad you're here.
喝一杯吧 Now, take a glass.
我不喝酒 I'm good.
你没必要这么紧张 You don't have to be.
这就对了 There you go.

来吧 Go on.
欢迎你 Right.

谢谢 Thank you.
得快点 马被包围了 Gotta move quick.

我对付比较远的 I got the far ones.
多谢了 Thanks.
多谢 Thanks.
我负责右边的 I got the ones on the right.
你来吧 Go ahead.
他就知道跑 He always ran.
你是在帮他 You were trying to help him.
- 嘿

嘿 你还好吗?

是的 Yeah.
就是有点不适应 Yeah.

- 我还是走吧

你不能逃跑 You're not bailing.
我们要一起面对 哥们 We're in this together, man.
你现在跟我们在一起 You're here with us now.
你现在跟家人在一起 You're here with family.
走吧 Come on.
嘿 Daryl Daryl.
嘿 Hey.
我还以为你去那边参加聚会了 Thought you were going that party over there.
Eric脚踝伤了 Oh, I was never going to go
多亏他我才去不成 'cause of Eric's ankle, thank God.
那你干嘛说让我去?

我说试试 你也试了 I said try.

反正又没什么坏处 It's a thought that counts thing.
- 好吧

吃点晚饭 Have some dinner.
来吧 哥们 有正宗的通心粉 Come on, man.

你看 她来了 说明仓库没有人...

我跟你一起去 I'll go with you.
不行 记住...

- 你是隐形人

嘿 Rick 这是我的丈夫Pete Hey, Rick, this is my husband Pete.
嘿 很高兴见到你 Hey, good to meet you.
谢谢你为我们当巡警 I wanted to thank you for taking on being our constable.
如果人口继续增长 估计还需要更多 If we keep growing at this rate, we're gonna need even more.
希望如此 I hope so.
下周想不想来我的办公室?

我给你检查一下 I'll take a look at you.
我应该先声明我是医生的 And I probably should have said I was a doctor first.
我觉得你怎么说都不错 I think it sounded nice either way.
我给咱俩添点酒 I'm going to get us a refill.
- 我去吧

高兴吗?

是的 Yes, I am.
这个问题很傻 对吧?

没有 No.
不过 这里的风景很不错 Still, this place has a pretty amazing view.
是吗?

是啊 你看 Yeah, take a look.
跟从前一样的生活 Ordinary life like before.
倒也不一样 Well, not like before.
不一样 No.
是啊 Yeah, no.
我是说...

不是墙外 而是这里面 Not out there, in here.
每个人都经历了很多 You know, everyone's been through it somehow.
每个人 Everyone.
很多美好的事情消失了 And a lot of things disappeared.
也带走了很多不美好 But a lot of bullshit went with it.
他们的背景各不相同 They're all from totally different backgrounds,
都来自五湖四海 different places.
原本他们不可能遇见 They never would have even met.
但现在他们成为了彼此生命的一部分 And now they're part of each other's lives.
他们就是彼此的生命 They are each other's lives.
我想说 我们都失去过 I'm just saying, we all lost things,
但是我们也有收获 but we got something back.
即使收获的不够 It isn't enough,
但也是收获 but it's something.
是平局 哥们 No, it was a tie, man.
你看见了对吗?

没错 这儿的风景真的很好 Yeah, yeah, it's a pretty good view.
- 妈妈 没有曲奇了

我刚好认识做曲奇的人 Well, I happen to know the cookie maker.
她是我的一个好朋友 She's a good friend of mine.
也许我可以让她 And I might be able to see about her
专门给你做一批 making a whole batch just for you.
妈妈 他没有图章 Mom, he doesn't have a stamp.
哦 Oh.
你想敲个章吗?

当然 Sure.
现在你正式成为我们的一员了 See?

是啊 Yeah.
- 嘿 Sam

- 一会儿见

不想来参加 对吗?

我可以假装没来得及开门 I can pretend I didn't make it.
我叫Sasha I'm Sasha.
我是Spencer Deanna是我妈妈 I'm Spencer.

你的妈妈...

看起来人很好 she seems nice.
你要是跟我一起的话 Well, if you want to hang with me,
我保证你不被Neudermyer夫人缠上 I'll make sure you don't get stuck with Mrs.

她超级喜欢谈论 She really, really likes
自己是多么想要一个做通心粉的机器 talking about how much she wants a pasta maker.
你肯定不喜欢那种谈话 It's not a conversation you want to have.
失陪 Excuse me.
多谢 Thanks.
以后你在墙外边 Mmm, when you're out there,
如果碰巧进到一个商店之类的 if you happen to be in a store or something,
别忘了Neudermyer夫人想要一个做通心粉的机器 Mrs.

我们大家都希望她能早日住嘴 And we're all really trying to get her to shut up about it.
我们这里有成箱的干通心粉 I mean, we have crates of dried pasta in here,
但她可能是想自己做 but she wants to make her own or something.
其实我觉得她是没话找话...

即使你在外边发现那种工具 if you see one out on your travels,
估计也要很远才能...

我以为你说过了 I thought it was done.
你还没问过他吗?

问我什么?

我每到一个地方 都会有那种 When I got the place, there was that frame
散落的零件框架和装备 and some parts and equipment.
是之前房主留下的 Whoever lived here built them.
一辆机车用不了这么多零件吧 It's a lot of parts for one bike.
只要我看到有零件 我都会拿回来 Whenever I came across any parts out there, I brought them back.
我也不知道自己需要什么 I didn't know what I'd need.
我总以为自己知道该如何处理 I always thought I'd learn how to do it,
但我感觉你已经知道该怎么做了 but I get the feeling you already know what to do with it.
是这样的 And the thing is,
你需要一辆机车 you're gonna need a bike.
为什么?

我让Deanna不要给你安排工作 I told Deanna not to give you a job
是因为我有一份工作给你 because I think I have one for you.
我想让你成为亚历山德里亚的另一名招募者 I'd like you to be Alexandria's other recruiter.
我再也不想拿Eric的生命冒险了 I don't want Eric risking his life anymore.
你想用我的命 对吗?

是的 因为你知道自己在干什么 Yeah, because you know what you're doing.
你在墙外得心应手 You're good out there.
但你又不属于那里 But you don't belong out there.

我知道你不擅长人际交往 I know it's hard getting used to people getting used to you.
有时候你很需要独自一人在外待一会儿 And I understand right now you need to be out there sometimes.
我也是 So do I.
但我希望你帮我招人的主要原因是 But the main reason why I want you to help me recruit
你能分辨好人 is because you do know the difference
和坏人之间的区别 between a good person and a bad person.
我还有别的事要做 I got nothing else to do.
谢谢 Thanks.
好吧 Yeah.
我会给你抓些兔子 I'll get you some rabbits.
好 Great.
你最近在收集不同的钢针吗?

是啊 Yeah.
靠它活 因它死...

还用它来吃土豆之类的 and eat potato puffs by it.
向上帝祈祷 你不必再用它了 Pray to God you don't have to use it again.
向上帝祈祷 你会不习惯不再用它 Pray to God you don't get used to not using it again.
即使你用不着它了...

它也还是你的一部分 even when it's off your back.
你喝了多少?

我酒量很好 I am a large man.
我得喝很多啤酒 脸才会这么红 And I have had many beers to make up for that.
嗯哼 Uh

你知道吗?

通过那个勇敢的举动 我...

我意识到 这些事情 I have come to realize that things
在我身上起到很好的作用 have worked out pretty damn well for me.
你呢?

你做了什么?

我穿上了这条裙子 I put on this dress.
再试一次 Try again.
你在干什么?

Sam 你在这里做什么?

我跟踪了你 I followed you.
我还希望 你会多做些曲奇饼 I was hoping you were going to make more cookies,
可你来了这里 but then you came here.
我可以多做点 Well, I could make more.
我可以做很多 只给你 I could make a whole batch just for you.
- 想要吗?

- 我是说 想要 谢谢

但你得向我保证 But you've got to promise
我来这里的事 你要保密 me you can keep it secret that I came here.
但我必须告诉我妈妈 But I'd have to tell my mom.
因为我什么都会跟我妈妈说 I mean, I tell my mom everything.
你绝不能告诉任何人 You can never tell anyone,
尤其是你妈妈 especially your mom.
因为 如果你说了...

有天早上 你醒来...

你就不在你的床上了 and you won't be in your bed.
我会在哪儿?

你会在围墙之外 You'll be outside the walls
很远很远的地方 far, far away
被绑在一棵树上 tied to a tree.
你会不停尖叫 And you'll scream and scream
因为你很害怕 because you'll be so afraid.
没有人会来帮你 No one will come to help
因为没有人听得见 because no one will hear you.
但有种东西会听见 Well, something will hear you.
怪物们会来 The monsters will come.
在外面的那些 The ones out there.
他们朝你逼近时 你无法逃跑 And you won't be able to run away when they come for you.
他们会撕碎你 吃了你 And they will tear you apart and eat you up
这时你还活着 all while you're still alive.
你还有感觉 All while you can still feel it.
在那之后 And then afterwards,
谁也不知道你出了什么事 no one will ever know what happened to you.
如果你能保证 Or you can promise
不把在这里看到的事情告诉任何人 not to ever tell anyone what you saw here
那就什么也不会发生 and then nothing will happen.
你还能拿到曲奇饼 And you'll get cookies.
很多曲奇饼 Lots of cookies.
我想你知道该怎么做 I know what I think you should do.
这里的景色也很不错 对吧?

我已经很久没抱过孩子了 It's been a long time since I held one of these.
她和Carl...

他们是我留在这里的理由 they're why I'm still here.
我也明白了你一直跟我说的话 And I get what you've been telling me.
什么话?

这里没那么糟糕 Here isn't that bad.
你想抱抱她吗?

好 Yeah.
Sasha 来加入我们吧 Sasha.

我保证你只要听就行 I promise all you have to do is listen.
来吧 Come on.
好的 Okay.
上帝保佑 我不明白她怎么会看那么久 Bless her heart.

我们只复印了一本 I mean, we only have one copy
而图书俱乐部的宗旨是 我们都能读那本书 and the point of book club is that we all read the book.
我只是一直希望 有个牙医会出现在我们门口 I just keep hoping that a dentist shows up at our gates.
- 这是他的牙齿

它还新鲜的时候 真是好吃太多了 it's just so much better when it's fresh.
它还新鲜的时候 真是好吃太多了 I mean, it's just so much better when it's fresh.
Sasha 亲爱的 你最喜欢吃什么?

我很愿意以后为你做顿饭 I'd love to cook it for you sometime.
我会为所有的新人这么做 I'm doing it for all the new arrivals.
- 我不知道

每个人都有最爱的食物 你的是什么呢?

什么都可以 Whatever you want.
我只是担心 I'm just worried that I'll
我最后做了些你不喜欢的 end up cooking something you hate, you know?
你担心?

你担心的就是这个吗?

我在努力弄明白怎么回事 I'm trying to figure out what it is.
到底是怎么回事 What it is exactly.
这...

这不是真的 it isn't real.
Sasha 你遭遇了很多 Sasha, you've been through a lot
我能理解 但你刚刚说的话...

纯属扯淡 that's bullshit.
随你挑 Take your pick.
听着 我一直在想 Look, I've been thinking.
我们真的需要这些吗?

如果事情恶化 对 没错 I mean, things go bad, yeah, sure.
我们要做该做的事 但就像你说的 We do what we gotta do, but it's like you said.
我们不需要这些 We don't need these for that.
目前不需要 Right now we don't.
你想让我试试 对吗?

我现在没事了 I'm good.
