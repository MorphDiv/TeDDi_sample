你可以畅所欲言 You may speak freely.
回宰相大人 我说的是实话 I do, Chancellor.
我认为你的工作与动物无二 It seems to me that yours is the work of animals.
没有任何价值 I see no worth in it,
只证明了我们最基本的本能 as it speaks to our most base instincts.

成吉思汗嘲笑我 Genghis laughed at me.
接着便自己走了 He went off on his own.
成吉思汗没有阿里不哥那样的兄弟 The Great Genghis did not have a brother like Ariq.
一位大汗不应有忧虑和遗憾 A Khan has no qualms or regrets.
艾哈迈德和我说过 Ahmad spoke to me.
他觉得战争是解决之道 He thinks war is the answer.
艾哈迈德为什么会和你说起战争 Why does Ahmad speak to you of war?
他是个值得信任的臣子 而我是皇后 He is a trusted minister.

他是怀疑他的大汗能否做出正确的决定 He has much doubt his Khan will make the true decision.
他想让你对我吹吹枕边风 He wanted to use you to sway my mind.
那他显然找错了人 Well, he clearly came to the wrong person.
我应该把他的蛋割下来喂野猫的 I should feed his balls to feral cats.
他搞不清自己的身份了 He takes liberties with his station.
他一直维护你 他对你是一片赤诚 He defends you and wants only the best for you.

"伟大的探险家" "The Great Explorer."
不 No.
我觉得它的意思是 I think it means...
"苍白的花朵" "Pale Flower."
"花朵" "Flower"?
你看起来 You look...
好像一碰就碎 delicate to the touch.
我在战场上杀过上百人 I have killed hundreds of men in battle.
我可没说苍白的花朵就没有刺 I didn't say the Pale Flower didn't have thorns.
比蒙古箭头还要锋利 Sharper than a Mongolian's arrow.
我该害怕吗 Should I be afraid?
除非你侮辱我 Only if you insult me.
这样的话 Then...
我可得注意我的言辞了 I must watch my words.
那些你被你征服的女人 And the women you have conquered.
她们在你手中融化了吗 Did they melt in your hands?
就像沙漠中的雪一样 Like snow in the desert.
把我放在你手心里吧 Take me in your hands.
不是这样 Not that.
你们在威尼斯也摔跤吗 Do you wrestle in Venice?
当然了 Of course.
给我看看 Show me.
我不想伤到你 I don't want to hurt you.
如果苍天有眼 If the Gods are always watching...
我们不妨让他看出好戏 we might as well put on a good show.
失眠是对年老和有罪之人的 The inability to sleep is the curse of the aged...
诅咒 and the guilty.
也是对痛风之人的诅咒 And the gout

请您原谅 Pardon me.
我竟愚钝地以为您是梦到了 I foolishly assumed you were dreaming about
您兄弟的头在尘土中滚动 your brother's head rolling in the dirt...
而他的身体则成为了秃鹫的美食 his body, a feast for vultures.
他们恨我吗 Do they hate me?
最好是让别人恨您现在的样子 It is better to be hated for what you are
而非让人欣喜您没能成为的样子 than to be loved for what you are not.
你真是个胡言乱语的傻瓜 You're a drunken fool.
那杀了我啊 So, kill me.
我确实有过这个想法 I have thought about it.
但您想安然入睡 But you wish to sleep.
我知道你想告诉我一个老生常谈的故事 I know you want to tell me one of those endless stories
都是你那可恶的汉人老师告诉你的 from that infernal Chinese teacher of yours.
今晚没有故事 陛下 No stories tonight, Sire.
也没有禅宗的谜语吗 No Zen riddles?
我今晚告诉您一个事实 I will offer a truth instead.
如果您当初饶阿里不哥一命 Had you spared Ariq...
您就鼓动了其他的叛徒 you would have encouraged other traitors.
处决他是正确的 His execution was just.
不 但却是不得不为的 No.

在那个特殊时刻 为了保护您的王朝 in that moment, to preserve your Empire.
你减轻了一个忧虑 却加重了另一个 You ease one worry, but aggravate one greater.
生活就是如此 习惯就好 As life is wont to do.
-张嘴

-张嘴

闭嘴 Shut it!
告诉我们 马可 Tell us, Marco.
你们那里的盛宴能和我们的相比吗 Do your feasts compare to this?
两者大不相同 They are different.
在这里 我们吃猪 Here, we eat the pig.
在威尼斯 人和猪共舞 In Venice, they dance with it.
如果威尼斯的盛宴能和这相比 If the Venetian feasts were comparable,
我们的朋友为什么会离家呢 why would our friend leave home?
我们会戴上面具 We wear masks.
为什么 For what purpose?
面具让我们不用压抑自己 The mask frees us of inhibitions.
屠夫可以和商人的女儿上床 And the butcher beds the merchant's daughter...
而他的妻子在和园丁上床 while his wife beds the gardener.
面具能让人避免尴尬 The mask prevents embarrassment.
有趣 Interesting.
也许某些我们的将军未来也该戴上面具 Perhaps, some of our generals should wear masks in the future.
为了避免难堪 To prevent embarrassment.
我们有史上最厉害的将军 We have the greatest generals in the world and all of history.
如果成吉思汗或者忽必烈大汗指挥 We would have been victorious at Wuchang
我们武昌一役本该胜利的 had Genghis Khan or our Lord Kublai commanded.
我希望我们的将军更有侵略的血性 I prefer a general with aggression in his blood
而不是战马受了惊他都要吓得抖一抖 to one who quakes with trepidation on his steed.
我希望能有一个更纯粹的将军 I prefer a pure general.
一个蒙古人 土生土长的蒙古人 A Mongol, raised Mongol...
沐浴着成吉思汗抛洒的热血 走自己的路 bathed in the blood spilt by Genghis, steeped in his ways.
一个像你一样纯粹的战士 宾巴 A warrior like you, Byamba.

一个真正的蒙古人 一个男人 A true Mongol.

或者女人 Or woman.
大汗听从我们的建议了吗 Has the Khan heeded our counsel?
我们的大汗很有主见 Our Khan has a will of his own.
他若不能实施 他的主见是没有用的 It is a will that may break if he fails to act.
不管他想如何 我们都会支持他 We will support and reinforce his will, whatever it might be.
当然了 大人 Of course, Minister.
我们必须支持服从 I would never suggest otherwise.
他是我的大汗 He is my Khan.
忽秃伦越大越骁勇 Khutulun has grown more fierce with age.
也越漂亮了 And more beautiful.
我女儿好像永远都嫁不出去了 It appears my daughter will never take a husband!
-女儿

她的贞操只会献给能打败她的人 whose virginity is promised to any man who can defeat her.
她的追求者不计其数 他们献上大量马匹 Suitors abound, offering horses by the score
就为争取一个机会与她摔跤赢她 for an opportunity to wrestle and win her.
我的牧群是壮大了 但是...

我会给忽秃伦找个配得上她的人 I will find Khutulun her match.
你该去挑战她 宾巴 You should challenge her, Byamba.
你是个强大的勇士 You are a powerful warrior.
我配不上公主 海都 I am not worthy, Kaidu.
要是攻打武昌时是忽秃伦率领众将士 Imagine if Khutulun had commanded our armies at Wuchang.
她肯定能凯旋而归 A glorious victory she would have given our Lord.
我们还差一位摔跤手 王子 We are one wrestler short, Prince.
是否想去一试身手呢 Care to test your skills?
向我们展示一下 Show us the...
你血液中的勇猛 aggression in your blood?
我愿一试 I would be honored...
海都大人 Lord Kaidu.
儿子 Son.
我是吗 Am I?
我们的大汗竟然会侮辱他唯一真正的继承者 I doubt the Great Khan would humiliate his one true heir.
不 大汗不会羞辱他唯一真正的儿子 No, the Khan wouldn't shame his one true son
让他自已去参加宴会 by leaving him to attend
身边就带一个拉丁人 还有一个混蛋...

下手吧 Go on!
杀了我 Kill me.
我的叔叔 窝阔台 病重时...

大夫和萨满...

觉得可以通过祭祀山羊 野猪 雄鹿 thought they could appease the spirits...
来抚慰鬼神 by sacrificing goats, boars and stags.
但窝阔台的病却越发严重了 But Ogodei's illness just grew worse.
所以他们就祭祀女人 So, they tried offering women...
乞丐 农民 beggars and peasants.
可是毫无作用 Nothing.
然后就开始祭祀宫里的人 Then men from the court.
可他的病还是愈发严重 Still, his illness increased.
在他快到鬼门关时 And soon, when he was at death's door...
他最信任的萨满决定 his most trusted shaman determined that...
