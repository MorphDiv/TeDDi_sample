我在沙滩上见到了克洛伊 I just saw Chloe at the beach.
她来留下了一个毛绒玩具 She was leaving a stuffed animal.
我没说是他 I did not confirm that.
他们公布了他的名字 They released his name.
《恩点镇日报》欧·伯克 有消息称在恩点镇沙滩边发现的尸体 是12岁的丹尼尔·索拉诺 死因尚不明确 有待进一步核实
是谁告诉那个记者的 Who told that journalist?
有人企图把这案子伪造成意外 Someone wanted to make it look like an accident.
但那孩子根本没上来过 But that kid wasn't up here.
你昨晚去哪儿了 Where were you last night?
我说过了 I told you.
我在上班 I was working.
如果你或者你认识的人 If you or someone you know
有相关线索 has any information,
请站出来 please come forward now.

哈维岭注意事项
你做噩梦了 You had a nightmare.
-是吗

我说什么了 What

你今天要去上班吗 Are you going to work today?
是啊 真抱歉 我得去上班 Yeah, I'm sorry.

警察会找我去谈话吗 Will I have to talk to the police?
今天不会的 但估计很快就会找你了 Not today, but soon, probably.
他们找我谈的时候 能是你跟我谈吗 When I do talk to them, could it be with you?
估计不行 宝贝 I don't think so, sweetie.
为什么这么问 Why?
你有事想告诉我吗 Is there something you want to tell me?
没有 No.
我不希望你担心这些 Listen, I don't want you to worry.
一切都会好起来的 Everything's gonna be just fine.

吊唁簿
丹尼尔·索拉诺 2001.

恩点镇警察局
卡弗警探 警探 Detective Carver.

我是《旧金山国际报》的蕾妮·克莱蒙斯 Renee Clemons, San Francisco Globe.
我曾在...

你真的认为我能忘了你吗 You honestly think I don't remember you?
能请你喝杯咖啡吗 Can I buy you a coffee?
你在开玩笑吗 Is that a joke?
不如我们重新认识一下吧 How 'bout we make a fresh start?
关注度只会越来越高 Attention's only gonna build.
为何不让我站在你这边呢 Why not let me tell your side?
我沿着丹尼的路线去了观察点 I walked Danny's route to the observation point.
哈维岭上有栋房子 There's a house on Harvey Ridge,
离发现丹尼尸体的地方两千五百米 mile and a half from Danny's body.
那块地是公园管理局的 Park Service owns that.
他们把它租出去了 They rent it out.
查查过去六周都谁在那里待过 Find out who's stayed there past six weeks.
告示牌那里有个摄像头 离房子45米远 And there's a camera at the lookout, 50 yards down.
去把录像取来 Get the footage.
排查的结果怎么样 How's the house

我们派了五个警官去查 We've got five officers on it,
还派了两个雷德伍德的预备警员 plus two cadets down from Redwood.
-其他人呢

黑斯廷斯和尤里卡有保护海洋生物的活动 Whalefests at Hastings and Eureka,
还有场大型自行车赛 plus the big bike race

保护海洋生物 Whalefests?
你就让我这么告诉那家人吗 I'm gonna tell that to the family?
我刚跟摩根局长谈过了 I was just in with Chief Morgan,
他说县警长会派更多人来 And he said the county sheriff will send more people.
现在开始桌上不许放案件相关信息 All desks are clear from now on.
好的 但你...

-米勒

先着重查丹尼的滑板和手机 Danny's skateboard, Danny's cell

我还要一份嫌犯名单 And I need a list of suspects.
你了解这个镇 谁最有可能是凶手 You know the town, who's most likely?
如果这孩子在到达沙滩前就被杀了 If the kid was killed before the beach,
那案发现场在哪 Where's the murder scene?
杰克·莱因霍尔德来电话了 Jack Reinhold called.
他说他想起了一件很重要的事 而且...

不客气 You're welcome.
-艾尔

别拍了 你们能别拍了吗 Can you stop?

每次我们打开门...

-弗雷德 管管

好了 我们进去吧 Okay, come on.

这有必要吗 Is this really necessary?
我说了 他们只想排除指纹 As I said, they're just elimination prints
这样我们就能排除掉 So we can rule out your prints
你们在这里和其他地方留下的指纹了 from those we find here or anywhere else.
既然她想采集 那就是有必要 And if she wants us to do it, it's necessary.
你们昨晚睡觉了吗 Did anyone get any sleep last night?
我不会乱猜的 I don't imagine.
这位皮特是你们的官方联络人 Pete here will be your official liaison.
他会一直守在外面 He will be posted outside at all times.
他会将所有信息传达给你们 He'll give you information on everything.
你们的疑问都可以问他 You can ask him any questions you need to.
为什么不是你守在外面 无意冒犯 Why can't you do that?

没关系 Oh, none taken.
那是一个相当专业的工作 It's a highly specialized job,
皮特刚刚受训结束 And Pete's just finished his training.
新鲜出炉哟 Out of the frying pan.
什么 What?
我们了解你 艾莉 你也了解我们 We

我知道 贝丝 I know, Beth.
如今我最能帮上你们的 And the best thing that I can do for you now
就是找到杀害丹尼的凶手 不是吗 is to find out who killed Danny, okay?
-没错

克洛伊 宝贝 下一个是你 Chloe, sweetheart, you're gonna be next.
那葬礼怎么办 And how about the funeral?
我们能开始准备了吗 Can we at least start planning that?
还不行 Not yet.
在我们找出凶手 Until we find the person responsible
收监之前 丹尼的...

他的尸体...

我很抱歉说出这种话 Look, I'm sorry to talk this way,
但他的尸体是目前最有价值的证据 but it's the most valuable piece of evidence we have.
在确定找到真凶之前 We cannot allow the body to be buried
我们不能让他入土为安 until we're sure we've got the right person.
我们不能带他回来 We can't have him back.
他不只是证据 他还是我弟弟 He's not just evidence.

我知道 亲爱的 我很抱歉 I know, sweetheart, and I'm sorry.
太可怕了 That's terrific.
把纸给她 Give her the paper.
我们列了个名单 上面是有可能杀他的人 We made a list.

好的 Okay.
这些可都是你的朋友 These people are all your friends.
是的 We know.
米勒警探 Detective Miller?
-抱歉打扰

能过来一下吗 You have a minute?
五百元现金用胶带粘在丹尼的床底 500 in cash taped under Danny's bed.
不是吧 You're kidding.
我们还在女儿的房间地板下找到了这个 And we found this in the daughter's room under a floorboard.
问题来了 Here we go.
昨晚我一直在想他的事 I couldn't stop thinking about him last night.
丹尼断断续续地参与了不少 Danny had been a big part
野生动物社团的活动 of the wild life group on and off,
还值班 doing his shifts.
话不多 A quiet kid.
心眼好 A good heart.
这点很重要 It matters, good heart.
你说你记起了曾经见过丹尼 You said you remembered something about seeing Danny.
是的 Yes, I did.
大约几周前 About a couple of weeks ago

也可能是十天前 Or maybe it was ten days

我正在去鱼鹰角悬崖的路上散步 I was taking a walk up the cliff path out by Osprey Point,
大约是早上七点半 about 7:

我看见他和一个人在一起 And I saw him with someone.
和谁 With who?
我不清楚 I don't know.
但他和那人待在悬崖上 But he was out on the cliff with someone.
丹尼把他的笔记本 He had his notebook in his lap,
摊在腿上 Danny did

那本他们用来记录海洋生物的笔记本 The one they use to record sea life with.
但他转身和那名年轻人说话了 But he was turned to talk to this young fellow.
那人穿着登山靴 背着大背包 Hiker boots, big pack

是名背包客 backpacker.
中等身材 Medium height.
头上绑着头巾 He had a bandana on.
比起记录鲸鱼的数量 Danny looked far more interested
丹尼更喜欢跟他聊天 in talking to him than he did in counting whales.
丹尼在笑 Danny laughed about something.
那时我没觉得有什么问题 Seemed innocent at the time.
你昨天来过之后 我就想起来了 It was only after you were in yesterday that I remembered.
我当然希望这与命案没有关联 I sure hope this doesn't have anything to do with what happened.
不然我会自责死的 I'd feel terrible if it did.
-你告诉我父母了吗

求你别说 那不是我的 Please don't.

是在你屋里发现的 It was in your room.
-我没吸过 我发誓

当然不是 我...

既然你不吸毒也不贩毒 So if you don't use it and you don't deal it,
那你为什么会有 then why did you have it?
是帮别人藏匿吗 Did somebody ask you to hold it for them?
你是想保护这个人吗 Are you trying to protect that person?
只是很小的一包 It's just one tiny bag.
不如我们就这么跟你妈妈说吧 Okay, then why don't we go tell your mom that.
别 别 别 No.

你说了不会告诉她的 You said you wouldn't.
克洛伊 持有一级毒品属于刑事犯罪 Chloe, possession of a schedule I drug is a criminal offense.
一级毒品包括鸦片 吗啡 海洛因和可卡因
交易一级毒品也是刑事犯罪 Dealing a schedule I drug is a criminal offense.
我只负责中转 I was just handing it off.
那就算交易 That is called dealing.
只要你说实话就不会有事 You will not get in trouble if you tell me the truth.
可卡因是谁给你的 Who gave you that cocaine?
嘉玛·费舍 Gemma Fisher.
酒馆那个吗 At the inn?
我有时给她打扫房间 I work for her cleaning rooms sometimes.
勤杂工 满意了吧 Housekeeper.

那钱是从哪里来的 What about the money?
什么钱 What money?
克洛伊 别装傻 Chloe, do not be a smart

我对钱的事一无所知 我发誓 I don't know anything about any money, I swear.
为什么嘉玛·费舍 Why would Gemma Fisher
要把可卡因给一个15岁的姑娘 be giving a 15

老天 我遇上大麻烦了 Oh, my God.

丹尼有参与中转毒品吗 Did Danny have anything to do with drugs?
-任何方面

根本没有 他...

天呐 拜托 让我静静 God, please, just leave me alone.
我真想躲起来死掉算了 I just want to curl up and die.
我不是这意思 I didn't mean that.
恩点镇日报社
"我们非常想念他 "We miss him terribly.
他的离去让每个恩点镇居民都心痛不已" He's left a hole in Gracepoint's heart."
这句话是不是让它更糟了 Does that just make it worse?
它已经糟到底了 What could make it worse?
现在海滩边有三顶帐篷 There are three tents on the beach now.
你知道他们什么时候才能拆掉吗 Any idea when they're gonna come down?
估计等他们查完就会拆了吧 When they're done, I guess.
短时间应该不会拆 Not soon.
我只是希望他们找到凶手 You know, when they catch whoever did this,
我赞成判他公开死刑 I vote for a public lynching.
应该把他们吊死 They should string them up.
-有时间过来喝一杯

房间还行吧 Is your room okay?
房间非常棒 Room is excellent.
那就好 Good.
你叫欧文 对吗 Owen, right?
蕾妮·克莱蒙斯 Renee Clemons,
戴着她最喜欢的围巾 in her favorite scarf.
什么意思 Sorry?
《旧金山国际报》 蕾妮·克莱蒙斯
欢迎来到恩点镇 Welcome to Gracepoint.
谢谢 环境真不错 Thank you.

是吗 Right?
我们布置得非常古朴 Yeah, we do quaint well.
或者说是...

凯西 这位是《旧金山国际报》的蕾妮 Kathy, this is Renee from the Globe.
我希望在镇上的这段时间能有个地方 Listen, I was hoping that I could set up somewhere
让我暂时落下脚 有空桌子吗 while I'm in town

没问题 Yeah, can't see why not.
-你来得可真快

亚瑟·哈尔彭向你问好 Arthur Halpern says hello.
是吗 你怎么认识亚瑟·哈尔彭的 Oh, yeah?

加州大学欧文分校 他是我的导师 UC Irvine.

-我以前的主编

还是爱人...

直到我不再喜欢异性 Till I decided I didn't like penises.
蕾妮想要张闲置的桌子 所以...

是的 我还需要一台打印机 Yeah.

-不行

我们这里的工作非常忙碌 We're a busy operation here.
看出来了 I can see that.
如果我给了你桌子 其他人 I give you a desk, what am I gonna do
也来提同样要求怎么办 when your cohorts start coming?
明白了 Gotcha.
我会想办法的 Well, I will make it work.
还是要谢谢你 Thanks anyway.
不如带我四处逛逛吧 蕾妮
这事肯定仅此一次 It's got to be a one

我是说 他们不是那样的家庭 I mean, they're not that kind of family,
克洛伊不是那种女孩 and Chloe's not that kind of girl.
是啊 没人会干坏事 米勒 Nobody ever is, Miller.
我住在这 I live here.
最多就是每个月有几起 I mean, we get a couple of bookings
未交定货的事 大多是大麻 for possession every month

但也就仅此而已 But hardly anything more than that.
就只有你自己的份吗 Just making one for yourself?
-艾莉

你应该来接这通电话 I think you might want to take this one.
好的 Okay.
你干什么呢 What are you doing?
换电话线 Just, uh, the phone lines.
赶紧换 Uh

萨姆 一定要清理桌面 Sam, clear desk.
你还好吗 Are you all right?
我很好 我们去拜访一下费舍小姐吧 I'm fine.

可卡因是你给克洛伊的吗 Did you give Chloe the cocaine?
不算是 Not really.
这什么意思 What does that mean?
有一对夫妻 There was a couple
从西雅图过来度周末 down from Seattle for the weekend.
他们住在套间里 They were staying in a suite,
花了不少钱 spending lots of money.
他们问我能不能给他们弄点可卡因 They asked me if I could get them some coke.
克洛伊那天当班 Chloe was working that day,
我就问她知不知道能从哪搞到点 so I asked her if she knew where I could get some.
但她花了太长时间 那对夫妻已经走了 But she took so long, the couple had gone.
我就还给她了 So I gave it back to her.
那克洛伊又是从哪拿到的 And where did Chloe get it from?
她说是个朋友 但他不贩毒 She said a friend.

只是知道从哪能搞到货 he just knew where to get some.
她弟弟跟这事有牵扯吗 Did her brother have anything to do with this?
没有 No.
完全没关系 It's got nothing to do with that.
好吧 我被捕了吗 Okay, do I get arrested?
我们得先起草罪名 We need to process the offense.
我知道这事挺傻的 I know this was really stupid,
但我们能不能低调处理 but is there any way we can do this quietly?
我是说 因为这事我执照可能都保不住 I mean, I could lose my license for this.
找时间来警局录份口供 Make a time to come down to the station and give a formal statement.
你会被罚款 指纹归档 然后释放 You'll be charged, fingerprinted, and released.
我们会尽量低调 And we'll try to keep it quiet.
是吗 Really?
这样我们就能为调查缩小指纹范围 That way, we'll have elimination fingerprints for the investigation,
你也可以继续做你的生意 好吗 and you can get on with your business, okay?
别担心 Don't worry.
我们不必告诉马克和贝丝的 对吧 We don't have to tell Mark or Beth about this, do we?
别这么做 米勒 Don't do that, Miller.
-我做什么了

别跟他们说没什么好担心的 Don't tell them they don't need to worry.
-你说什么

让他们有点压力 Let them feel the pressure.
我能说两句吗 Can I say something?
你不是来这训练我的 You're not here to train me.
我知道自己在做什么 I know what I'm doing.
知道该怎么跟人打交道 I know how to handle people.
你可以收起你那套 So you can keep your brooding,
深沉又混蛋的大城市警察架子了 assaholic, big city cop act to yourself.
长官 Sir.
有薯片吗 Potato chips?
我们家怎么没薯片 Why don't we have any potato chips in this house?
你不想要薯片 You don't want potato chips.
不 我想吃薯片 No, I do.

你要去哪 Where are you going?
出门 我要出门 Out.

你最好跟皮特讲一下 Oh, you should probably clear it with Pete.
妈妈 我 Mom, I

我要去趟超市 好吗 I am going to the supermarket, all right?
就这些 我又不是没去过超市 That's all.

-我去给你买吧

就把你要买的东西告诉我 But just give me your list

不用 老妈 你就 No, mom!

别来烦我 行不 please stop smothering me, all right?
对不起 I'm sorry.
贝丝 Beth?
你还好吗 You all right?
我怀孕了 I'm pregnant.
你跟谁说过吗 Have you told anyone?
没有 Nope.
刚知道两周 I've only known for two weeks.
那马克呢 What about Mark?
很复杂 马克他...

马克要他想要的 Mark wants what he wants.
这次我得知道自己想要的是什么了 This time I need to know what I want.
我知道 I know.
我理解 That makes sense.
但我不知道自己想要什么 Yeah, except I don't.
你还能跟谁说 Uh...

或许跟你妈妈说下 Maybe your mom?
不行 还不行 No, I can't yet.
你也不准告诉她 And don't you dare tell her either.
不会的 No.
老天 God.
你觉得我该怎么做 What do you think I should do?
-贝丝

你不是该指引众人吗 Aren't you supposed to advise people?
我不能告诉你该怎么做 I can't tell you what to do.
我20年前没法告诉你 I couldn't tell you 20 years ago,
现在也不行 I can't tell you now.
这点我们都清楚 I think we both know that.
我一听说就一直在为你和丹尼祈祷 I've been praying for you and for Danny since I heard.
是啊 Yeah.
谢谢你 保罗 Thank you, Paul.
我能抱你一下吗 Can I give you a hug?
可以 Yeah.
可以 谢谢你 Yeah, thank you.
我当然同情受害者的家人了 Of course I feel for the family.
他们太可怜 太不幸了 It's terrible for them.

谁遇到这种事会不难受 Don't think we won't all suffer.
周六晚上 生意这么冷清 Saturday night, you got no one.
你不说我都没注意 内德 真是谢谢了 I hadn't noticed that, Ned.

才有一群灰鲸搁浅了 Dozens of grey whales just offshore,
没人去帮他们 not a soul to take out there.
经济衰退 天气糟透 We've had a recession, crap weather,
半条主干道都被封了 half of main street already shut.
现在又成了谋杀小镇 Now we're a murder town.
是啊 有个孩子死在这里了 Yes.

发生这么多破事 What tourist is gonna want to come to Gracepoint
哪还有游客会来恩点镇 with all those tents front and center, hmm?
应该得出去宣传 自己把旅客拉回来 We ought to march over there and pull them down ourselves.
但首先 我要再来杯波本酒 Though first, I will have one more bourbon.
不行 你不能再喝了 Oh, no.

不给你续酒了 I'm cutting you off.
你听她说的 Listen to that.
她觉得我喝多了 She thinks I'm drunk.
你肯定喝多了 Well, yeah, you must be.
听你说话就知道了 From the way you're talking, I mean.
已经40个小时了 内德 It's been 40 hours, Ned.
那家人失去了他们唯一的儿子 That family have just lost their only son.
你想找点事干吗 What, you want something to do?
给他们写张卡片 You could write them a card,
送些花 send them some flowers,
给丹尼收集些野生动物标本 start a collection for Danny's wildlife group.
振作一点 然后尊重地哀悼逝者 Get a hold of yourself and grieve respectfully.
然后 等凶手被绳之以法时 And then, when the killer's been caught,
那孩子的事就过去了 that boy can be buried,
所有事都会回到正轨 all the tents will come down,
人们也会回到这里继续买酒 and people will come back and they will buy things.
但在那之前 你还是管好你的嘴 But until then, keep your mouth shut
像个人样 and be a decent person.
不用找了 Keep the change.
你会用得着的 You're gonna need it.
你想写这周的布道吗 You want to write this week's sermon?
这是什么 What's that?
玉米饼 中餐馆关门了 Burrito.

里面有豆子吗 Are there beans in it?
这是玉米饼 肯定有啊 It's a burrito.
你比我两岁的儿子还不懂事 I swear, you are worse than my two

下次我会叫他们不放豆子 Next time, I will ask them to leave the beans out.
我们彻底搜查了鱼鹰角的所有房屋 We've canvassed every house with a view of Osprey Point.
没人看到背着书包的丹尼 No one saw Danny with the backpacker,
或者看到书包 or saw the backpacker, period.
那也不能说明杰克·莱因霍尔德没看到啊 Which doesn't mean Jack Reinhold didn't.
那我们之前第一次跟他谈话的时候 But why didn't he mention it
他怎么什么也没说 when we spoke to him the first time?
是他不记得了 还是刻意隐瞒 Did he really not remember or did he choose not to tell us?
他有说谎的理由吗 Would he have a reason to lie?
在家中发现的毒品 And do we think the drugs
和钱是否真的有联系 and the money at the house are connected?
这些跟可卡因有关系吗 Was there any link to the cocaine?
你知道自己问得没完没了吗 You know you do this incessant question thing?
喋喋不休 不给人机会回答 Bam, bam, bam.

你好像特别享受 It's like you like it that way.
是吗 Do I?
第一件凶杀案 First murder.
很难破吗 Finding it tough?
这次我等你来回答 This time I'm letting you answer.
我觉得是的 The answer's yes.
你又怎么看马克和贝丝列的名单 What'd you make of Beth and Mark's list?
读着都让我不舒服 Made me sick to read it.
他的老师 保姆 一些挚友们 Teachers and babysitters

只不过 他们可能只是受惊了 It just

或者他们很狡猾 Or they're smart.
我们可没要名单 We didn't ask for a list.
他们可能是想左右调查方向 They could be trying to direct where we look.
把调查重点从他们家移开 Taking the focus off their family.
索拉诺一家没有伤害丹尼 The Solanos did not hurt Danny.
你是以一个警探的身份 You're saying that as a detective
还是以一个了解他们的人的身份说话 or as someone who knows them?
两者皆有 Both.
你得学会不信任何人 You have to learn not to trust.
这就是你要教我的东西吗 That's what you have to teach me?
你得尽最大努力 You're gonna have to do your best
置身事外地看待这个小镇 to try to see this town from the outside.
我做不到置身事外 I can't be outside.
我不想置身事外 I don't want to be outside.
如果做不到客观 你就不适合干这行 You can't be objective.

说不定你才不适合呢 Or maybe you're not the right fit.
来到这里接手一切 把所有人都看成邪恶的 Swooping in here, taking over, assuming everyone's evil.
我跟你说早上好 你就哼一声了事 I say, "Good morning," you grunt.
你向每个人发号施令 You bark orders at everybody

我们面对的是个死去的孩子 We're dealing with a dead child here.
对不起 Sorry.
这是个简单的事实 米勒 It's a simple truth, Miller.
在特定条件下 Anybody's capable of murder,
-谁都能杀人

大多数人 Most people...
都会讲道义 have a moral compass.
道义会崩塌 Compasses break.
-你是苏珊·怀特吗

卡弗警探 恩点镇警局 Detective Carver, Gracepoint PD.
你要干什么 What's this about?
停车场管理处的乔恩·库尔兹 Jon Kurtz from the park service
说你有哈维岭上小屋的钥匙 said you have the keys to the Harvey Ridge house.
我负责打扫 I clean it.
他说会提前打你电话 He said he'd phone ahead,
让你把钥匙准备好 let you know to have them ready.
我手机没电了 My phone's dead.
我需要钥匙 I need those keys.
-我要进去看看

是跟那男孩有关吗 Something to do with that boy?
结束之后 我马上把钥匙还给你 I'll bring the keys back when we're done.
再给我看一眼证件 Let me see that I.

安静 Quiet.
上帝啊 Oh...

你得签张借条 You got to sign for them.
万一你不还 我可不想惹上麻烦 I don't want trouble if you don't come back.
有什么发现就通知我 Let me know if you find anything interesting.
圣经《约伯记》
"即使他杀我 "Though he slay me,
我仍然要信靠他" yet, I will trust in him."
"即使心碎 信念永存 "Our hearts may be broken, but our faith must endure.
我们哭泣 "We weep...
我们忍受 我们愤怒 "We suffer...

但是我们不要背弃上帝 "But let us not turn our backs on God.
现在我们比任何时候都需要他 "Now more than ever, we need him.
我们要和他在一起" We turn to him."
对于星期二来说来的人可算多了 Big group for a Tuesday.
我也不清楚 I don't know.
可能发生这种事情以后 You'd think after something like this,
来的人会更多 we'd get even more.
我猜什么都没法成为上教堂的动力吧 I guess nothing's a given.
除了圣诞节 Except Christmas.
还有复活节 And Easter.
去年复活节连马克都来了 Even Mark came last easter.
他来了吗 我都忘了 Oh, did he?

就坐在前排靠右的地方 Sat right in front.
领带和贝丝的裙子很相衬 His tie matched Beth's dress.
帮帮她 好吗 Reach out to her, would you?
你对她一直这么好 You've always been so good for her.
我只是 我想给她一点空间 I just

有时候只有摆在他们面前 人们才知道 Well, sometimes people don't know what they need
自己真正需要什么 until it's given to them.
我想这就是为什么 I'm praying that's why
上帝将你带回了恩点镇 God brought you back to Gracepoint...
来帮助我的女儿 to help my daughter.
谢谢 Thanks.
你为什么不进去 Why don't you get in there?
教教他们怎么玩 Show 'em how it's done?
我不想去 I don't want to.
你想干点正常的事吗 You want to try to do something normal,
尝尝是什么感觉吗 see how it feels?
一切都正常不起来了 Nothing will ever be normal.
我知道你现在是这么想的 I know that's what you think right now,
但是不可能永远是这样 but it's not always gonna feel like this.
你想聊一聊吗 Do you want to talk about it?

我们只是在查该区域的监控 We're checking all the security footage in the area.
那晚你到底在做什么 What were you doing that night?
我现在是疑犯了吗 Am I a suspect?
我们首先要做的是排除嫌疑 First thing we do is eliminate people from the investigation.
告诉我你在哪儿 跟谁在一起 You tell me where you were, who you were with,
待了多久 how long you were with them

我就可以排除你的嫌疑了 I eliminate you from suspicion.
如果你不告诉我 If you don't tell me those facts,
我就没法排除 I can't eliminate you.
那你就是疑犯 You're a potential suspect.
谋杀自己儿子的疑犯 In my own son's murder?
我相信你能解释清楚 I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

然后被抛尸到离这儿 and moved two miles down the coast
两英里远的海滩边 to where we found him.
凶手为什么要这么做 Why would someone do that?
我的人把这里彻查了一遍 The guys have been all over this place.
有人打扫过这里 很彻底 Someone scrubbed it, top to bottom,
除了一个地方 with one exception.
我需要知道你那晚在哪儿 I need to know where you were that night.
我去见了个朋友 I met a friend.
我们喝了点小酒 然后我在停车场 We had some drinks, and then I got dropped off
下了车 然后就回家了 at the parking lot, then I came home.
