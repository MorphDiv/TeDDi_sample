您的账单 Here's your check.
薯条没算在里面 因为被我吃掉了 I didn't charge you for the fries, 'cause I ate them.
Max 当心!

餐厅里的水蝽大得惊人 The diner water bugs are getting really big.
别紧张 这是餐厅最新的无人侦察机 Relax, it's the diner's new surveillance drone.
天啊 我只是中饱私囊了几次 God, you empty the register five or ten times,
转眼信任就没了 suddenly there's no trust.
所以我们连肥皂都没有 却有架无人机?

我真受不了Han在暗地里监控我们 I hate that Han's just sitting in back, watching us,
还把操纵杆玩得那么欢 working his little joy stick.
拜托 就Han那小棒棒任谁也欢不了 Please, no one's getting any joy out of Han's little stick.
这家伙真烦人 This is so annoying.
总跟我屁股后面 It's following me.
就你那扁平的屁股 这是唯一一个 Well, with a butt that flat, it's the only black thing
肯跟在你身后的黑大壮了吧 that's ever going to follow you.
这里还有只嗡嗡叫的家伙?

我刚在厨房用苍蝇拍拍死一只 I just killed one in the kitchen with a fly swatter.
走开 Go.
我要是想被暗中监视 I mean, if I wanted to be spied on,
早就改名叫阿克曼了 I'd change my name to Achmed,
"往生恐怖份子阿克曼"是网络点击率极高的表演短片
或者是在机场附件买个公寓 and buy a condo near the airport.
咋不买这样的一幅画呢 Whatever happened to buying a painting
画着一个老船长把观察孔挖空 of an old sea captain, drilling out the eye holes,
躲在后面窥视的那种 and hiding behind it?
这样不好 Han Not cool, Han.
最糟糕的是 它老是乱动 And the worst part is, it's moving around so much,
害得我都找不准角度 I can't find my good angle.
这样就不是Han的做派了 Not cool and not Han.
这是在他跟我解释拿最低工资的 I stole this while he was explaining to me
77岁老头为何不需要医保的时候 why a 77

我趁机偷的 doesn't need health care.
Earl 这挺不错的啊 Earl, that is awesome.
才不好 我真的需要那医保 Not really.

不 我指的是你偷的这玩意 No, that you stole that.
我们得采取点措施 好让Han We need to do something that will make Han
永远不再想监视我们 never want to spy on us again.
Oleg 解开裤带 Oleg, open your pants.
Earl 把摄像头对准那里 Earl, fly that camera in there.
但首先 你得脱掉内裤 But first, take off your underwear.
内裤?

别逗了 当我还小?

还是我"弟弟"小?

Oleg 你难道不担心Earl的白内障吗?

最好的打算 是被刮掉阴毛 Best case scenario, I get a little manscaping.
最差的打算 就是被割下包皮 Worst case, I've been meaning to get circumcised.
我被亮瞎了!

Max 我在填写银行贷款的支票 Max, I'm writing out the check for our bank loan,
但不是很确定余额是多少 and I'm not quite sure what our balance is
因为在"提款"处 你只写了"是的" because here under "Withdrawal"" You just wrote, "Yeah""
你不喜欢那个的话 肯定也不会喜欢 Well, if you don't like that, you're really not going to like
我在"存款"处作的画了 the picture I drew under "Deposits."
我看见了 I saw it.
Max 零可不是蛋蛋 不是咪咪 Max, zeroes are not balls, they're not boobs,
更不是金鱼眼 and they're not googly eyes.
零就只是零 They're just zeroes.
那是你认为 Says you.
我去取款机查查余额 I'll go check our balance at the ATM.
虽然刚刚使用这机器的人 Even though the last guy who touched it
长了个很大的唇疱疹 had a cold sore so big,
我收了他两倍的费用 I charged him for a party of two.
别担心 你从那台破机器上 Don't worry.

什么都得不到 from that machine.
特别是钱 Especially cash.
嗨 各位亲 Hey, everybody.
对了 Oh, yeah.
来个人给我煮些蛋蛋 Somebody better make me some eggs
因为我进行了三个小时的果汁节食 because I've been on a juice cleanse for three hours,
都饿晕了 and I'm dizzy.
他们说这种方法很有效 Yeah.

但很显然见效慢 but it sure does go slow.
曾有人说很快 结果我等了三个星期 I was on a three weeks fast, once.
然后我才意识到我妈不会回家了 Then I realized my mother wasn't coming home.
所以我自己做了个三明治 So I made a sandwich.
我和Oleg新婚在即 Oleg and my wedding is coming up
我们想吃得干净一点 and we're trying to eat clean.
没错 宝贝 因为我们度蜜月时 Yeah, baby, 'cause you know we're eating dirty
会吃那些淫水 on the honeymoon.
老天爷啊 怎么了?

收据槽里又塞了个套套?

- 比这更糟

该戴套套却没有戴?

我们负债了 We're below zero.
我得走了 伙计们 Oh, well, I better go, y'all.
有个白人妇女在我身边尖叫 A white woman screaming anywhere in my vicinity
绝对不是好事 never turns out well.
这简直是飞来横祸 This is a disaster.
我曾经一无所有过 I've been at zero,
但从不至于亏空 but I've never had less than zero.
别这么说 Caroline Oh, don't say that, Caroline.
你忘了你的约会对象人数了 I mean, you're forgetting about your dating options.
我们现在负债了 We have less than zero money
无法偿还银行贷款 and no way of paying off our bank loan.
天啊 终于落到这地步了 Oh, my God.

我成工人阶级了 I'm working class.
嘿 我跟你一块儿当了四年的服务员 Hey.

你敢说自己这是在工作吗 and there's no way you could call what you do working.
纸杯蛋糕!

买纸杯蛋糕 Buy cupcakes.
来买纸杯蛋糕!

别喊了 Stop.
你看着比卡尔文广告里的贾斯汀·比伯 You look more desperate than Justin Bieber
还要绝望 in that Calvin Klein ad.
你根本不懂银行贷款的事 You don't understand the seriousness
有多么严重 of this bank situation.
你根本不懂魔兽世界里的规则 You don't understand the rules of World Of Warcraft.
贷款会不断地翻倍增加 The loan just keeps escalating and escalating
直到逼我们倒闭 until they close us down.
纸杯蛋糕!

来买纸杯蛋糕!

快看 有肥肉 Oh, Pay

是联谊会那又肥又胖的大个子 Here comes a big, fat frat house guy.
嘿 贱人们 Hey, bitches.
还记得我吗?

大个子玛丽 Big Mary.
就是这名字 永不过时 That's my name.

John 从糕点学校后就没见过你 John, we haven't seen you since pastry school.
嘿 看在老交情上 要买个纸杯蛋糕吗?

一打?

我来这里是因为我可能 So I came because I may know of a way
有办法让Max赚一些外快 for Max to make some extra money.
不管什么工作 她都做 Whatever it is, she'll do it.
那可是我纪念册上的座右铭 That was my yearbook quote.
我刚刚入职一家新开的餐厅 I just got hired at a new restaurant
就在曼哈顿的 that's opening under the High Line Park
高线公园 他们正在招聘一名 in Manhattan, and they are looking
白天上班的糕点师 for another day pastry chef.
我虽然只在糕点学校呆了一年 I only have a year of pastry school
不过貌似那一年我都神智恍惚 and I was stoned for, like, a year of that.
我不知道我能不能胜任 I don't know if I have the skills.
噢 别逗了 你肯定不够资格 Oh, girl, you don't.
但是那个经理 Joe 只看脸 But the manager, Joe, wants only pretty people.
你的美貌和性感足以 And what you lack in pastry,
弥补你专业能力的不足 you more than make up for in pretty.
她会去的 你会去的Max She'll do it.

有技术高超的John在那里 And John will be there to help back you up
他会帮助你的 with his pastry skills.
人家也是很美貌的 And 'cause I'm pretty.
我觉得那种地方不适合我 I don't belong in a place like that.
餐厅的名字叫 "糕潮" It's called "The High."
听起来不错 地址给我 Sounds right.

嗨 晚上好 女士们 Well, good night girls.
你们负债了 为此我很难过 Sorry about your bank balance.
但是我相信你们会像从前那样 But I trust you'll both lapse
很快地陷入自我否定当中 into denial fairly soon, as always.
嗨 Hello.
她是谁?

抱紧我 我的小舞伴 Hold me closer, tiny dancer.
噢...

仅仅目前 "还不是" You forgot the "Yet."
Max 是不是应该系上一两个扣子 Max, maybe button up a button or two.
这是餐吧 又不是酒吧 It's a dessert bar.

嘿 我需要这份工作 Hey, I need this job,
一旦这个叫Joe的家伙看见这对膨松的大馒头 and once this Joe guy takes one look at these puff pastries,
也许他就会手下留情 he might cut me some slack when he sees
无视我做的那些不怎么膨松的糕点 my other "Not so puff" Pastries.
你这样能心安理得吗?

没错 Yup.
就像我觉得 Like I guess you're comfortable
你的服务水平那么差 applying for a waitress job
也敢心安理得地去应聘服务员 on just the merits of your waitress skills.
我要再多解开几个扣子吗?

有用吗?

我来了 I'm here.
把申请表都给我吧 速度 女士们 I'll take those applications.

如果我要找个好看却又反应慢的人 我就会雇佣尼克·乔纳斯 If I was looking for pretty and slow, I'd hire Nick Jonas.
Max 我们走吧 Max, let's get out of here.
她让我想到了 She reminds me of this nightmare
关于自己余生惨状的噩梦 I'm going to have for the rest of my life.
别怕 她只不过是经理的看门狗 Relax, she's just his guard dog.
Joe才是我们要搞定的家伙 It's Joe guy we have to impress.
不行 谢谢 No thank you.
不行 谢谢 No thank you.
你居然有脸来申请?

我是来应聘糕点师的 And I'm here to apply for a pastry chef.
我也27 但我从6岁时就长这样 Also 27, but I've looked this old since I was 6.
曾有一段时间 我以为自己都逆生长了 For a while, I thought I had that Benjamin Button's disease.
我先来面试糕点师 I'll take the pastry chef first.
你坐在旁边等会吧 Why don't you sit over there and wait.
不会很久的 因为坦白说 I won't be long, because frankly,
你不会有很多时间的 you don't have the time.
谢谢 我就在那等着 Thank you.

分吃一桶爆米花的同龄女性朋友?

刚刚你说的每一句话都冒犯了我 Everything you just said offended me.
没错 这就是我的特点 Yeah, that's my brand.
而你又没对坐在电影院分吃爆米花 And the fact that you didn't cry
大喊大叫让我觉得 about splitting a popcorn makes me think
你有的是第一种女朋友 it's the first kind of girlfriend.

还得告诉年迈的爹妈说自己也是同性恋 that you're gay after your three older siblings
那才叫紧张呢 already came out.
我都不知道这些甜品都是啥玩意 I have no idea what most of these desserts are.
自"迷失"剧终后 我从未感到如此迷失了 I haven't felt this lost since the finale of Lost.

你确定吗?

打住!

那里面没什么能救你的 There's nothing in there to save you.
好吧 要是她被炒 那我也被炒了 Well, if she's fired, I'm fired, too.
哦 别冲动 诺玛·蕾 Oh, relax, Norma Rae.
诺玛·蕾：

作为服务员 她被炒了 She's fired as a waitress,
但我会雇佣她当迎宾小姐 but she's hired as a hostess.

因为你很漂亮 又亮出了胸部 Because you're pretty, you flashed a boob,
而且比起Allie呆过的三家戒瘾中心 and you took more control of Allie in five minutes
你能在五分钟就把她给控制住了 than anybody's been able to do in her three rehab stints.

所以这就是升职 我仅有的希望了 it has to be.
