"神盾局特工" 前情提要...

我为什么要相信你?

因为我们都有各自的秘密 Because we all have our secrets.

保护我们不受外界的威胁 Keeps us secret and safe from the outside world.
瑞娜的天赋可能会 Raina's gift may allow her
让她预见将会发生的事情 to see things before they happen.
基于你的天赋所做的任何决定都出自于我 Any decisions based on your gift will be made by me.
是谁决定了你在这儿对一切事情 Who decided you should have final say
都有最终决定权?

长官 您坐的航班怎么样?

又订的中间的座位 Another middle seat.
但我记得给你带了这个 But I remembered to bring you this.
哦 真贴心 谢谢你 长官 Oh.

希望他们永远不要停刊 Hope they never go out of business.
西蒙斯对海德拉的事适应得很好嘛 So, Simmons is adjusting nicely to Hydra.
她比看上去要强硬多了 She's tougher than she looks.
斯凯在梅给她的训练里也表现很好 Skye's doing well in her training with May,
特普常驻在我们那儿了 and Trip's on board full

哦 新招的人怎么样?

毕利说哈特利和亨特 Billy says that Hartley and Hunter
老是喝光他的啤酒 keep drinking all of his beer.
意料之中 Not surprised to hear that.
冈萨雷斯特工的事有进展吗?

很遗憾 没有 Unfortunately, no.
很有可能海德拉把他抓走了 There's a pretty good chance that Hydra took him out.
继续调查 Keep looking.
还有...

一点吧 Some.
梅还是以为你到伦敦去招聘新人了吗?

没错 所以我在这不能待太长时间 She does, which is why I don't have a lot of time here.
好吧 长官 首先你需要...

工作吊牌 没错 我需要这个 A lanyard.

蓝色和灰色...

和三角形的设计浑然一体 Gels nicely with the new triangular design.
随便吧 我们怎么称呼这个计划?

长官 叫希尔塔计划 The Theta Protocol, sir.
希尔塔计划 Theta Protocol.
我需要你帮我写下来 I need you to write that down for me.
我必须说 I got to tell you,
像天空母舰这么大的东西 it's not easy keep something
要藏起来可真不容易 as big as a helicarrier in secret.
神盾局特工 第二季第20集
现在
我摊牌了 Cards on the table.
显然 你和弗瑞一直都挺忙的 Obviously, you and Fury have been keeping busy.
我能怎么说呢?

神盾局解体后 弗瑞觉得我们需要一个保险措施 With the fall of S.

一个完全在台面下的东西 something completely off the books,
类似于"紧急情况时请打碎盖子"的这种东西 a "Break in case of emergency" type of thing.
好像你是打得挺碎的 Seems like you broke it wide open.
然后在过程中救了大家 And saved the day in the process.
过去一周发生的事是挺难接受的 What's transpired over the last week is a lot to take in.
我也明白 I know.
当我发现这艘船在海德拉的攻击下保存了下来 When I found out that this ship had survived Hydra's attack
而且那个机密货物还在船上 and still had that classified cargo onboard,
还有你在我的基地埋伏了间谍 that you placed spies on my base,
以及我无法保障我属下的安全...

我觉得我这个局长当得很失败 I felt like I'd failed as director.
而且事实是 我确实很失败 And the truth is, I did.
经历了一场政变 就会让人去思考诸如此类的事情 A coup will make you think about things like that.
我本想孤军奋战 那是我的错 I tried to do it all alone.

就算是弗瑞 也有个世界联盟在监督他 Even Fury had a world council watching over him,
给他指导 providing guidance.
你想说什么?

一个神盾局 One S.

我出任局长 而你提供顾问 where I operate as director, under your advisement.
这样一来 我们就有一个实打实的地下基地 还是一艘船 This way, we'll have a cool underground base and a boat.
叫我怎么跟你争呢 你可是从奥创手里 It's hard to argue with a man who prevented Ultron
拯救了千万人性命的人 from killing thousands of people.
但是前方还有许多场战斗在等着我们 But there are plenty more battles to be won,
其中一个还靠近家园 and one closer to home
我恐怕天空母舰派不上用场 that I fear the helicarrier won't solve.
她每天都来这 She's been in there every day.
你觉得他醒了之后她还会留下来吗?

她说想带他回家 She says she wants to take him home,
不管是什么意思吧 whatever that means.
她也不肯对那边的情况多说什么...

你可以把它卸下来了 巴拿马特工 You can go ahead and take that off now, Agent Palamas.
谢谢 唔 Thanks.

就你的情况而言 你的脑部扫描显示相当正常 Your brain scans look rather normal, considering.
那是什么意思?

嗯 显然你还有一些记忆脱节 Well, you'll still have some memory gaps, obviously,
但是海德拉给你洗脑 but any part of the Hydra indoctrination
影响你行为的那部分已经消失了 that was affecting your actions is gone.
你的思想不会再受限制了 Your mind's your own again.
谢谢你...

说实话 我觉得巴克希的死 Honestly, I think knowing Bakshi's gone
是最能帮到我的 has helped more than anything.
你跟我一样很清楚他是个什么样的禽兽 You know as well as I do what a monster he was.
你和莫尔斯特工一起潜伏在海德拉 是吗?

算是吧 Well, sort of.
我不知道她在那 I didn't know she was there at the time.
她当时是一头乌黑的秀发 She had very dark hair.
不过她确实救了我的命 就在...

嗨 没事的 我在这 你现在安全了 Hi.

还有额外福利呢...

也没有针戳破你的皮肤 with needles poking out of your skin.
斯凯 我们在哪...

不 No.
哦 Oh.
嗯...

你可以信任他们 You can trust them.
他们是我的朋友 帮我救了你 They're my friends.

你根本就不该来救我 You never should have come for me.
我必须去 I had to.
佳英不会同意的 如果我...

她不同意是有原因的 There's a reason for that.
这么多年能平安无事 就是因为 The only thing that's kept us safe all these years
我们的存在是个秘密 is that we were a secret.
现在神盾局知道了我们的存在 Now S.

不找到"来世" 他们不会善罢甘休 And they won't stop till they find afterlife.
蓝光吗?

从你儿子身上散发出来 每一个毛孔都在发光 Spilling out of your son, from every pore.
迈克尔 等他到了那个年龄 自会穿越迷雾 He'll go through the mist when he comes of age, Michael,
然后破茧成蝶 and he'll be beautiful.
谢谢你 Thank you.
你看上去不错 You're looking very well.
你说得没错 You were right.
确实是个天赋...

我只需要放开胸怀去接纳它...

接纳这里的生活 我的...

去帮助我的人民 to help my people.
你预见了塞戈维亚的灾难 Your vision of the devastation of Segovia
就已经对我们所有人证明了你的价值 has proved your value...

你还看到了其它幻象吗?

现在总是能看见 All the time now.
我现在平静下来了 不再那么饱含恐惧和痛苦 I'm starting to feel at peace, less fraught with fear and pain.
虽然有时候 要分清楚 Though sometimes, it's...

究竟是幻象还是梦境有点困难 to tell what's a vision and what's a dream.
也许我能帮上忙 Well, maybe I can help.
昨晚上 我看见了一个东西...

美得奇异 beautifully peculiar.
很难用语言去描述 It's hard to describe.
它是一块巨大的石头 但又不是石头 It was a giant stone, but not a stone.
然后 突然...

波涛拍打着海岸 waves crashing against the shore.
等等 Hold on.
这块石头...

是不是上面凿了深深的凹洞?

你怎么知道的?

这可能预示着我们的终结 This could mean the end of us.
我不明白 I don't understand.
你以前碰到过吗?

只从先祖流传下来的故事里读到过 Only through stories passed down by our ancestors.
那是克里帝国的东西 非常危险 用来摧毁我们 It's Kree, dangerous, intended to destroy our people.
难道不是他们创造了我们吗?

然后他们觉得我们是个错误 Then they decided we were a mistake.
戈尔工 你觉得你能定位它 确认它的存在吗?

如果是克里帝国的东西 我觉得我可以有办法连接上它 If it's Kree, I suppose I could find a connection to tether.
但必须在它附近才行 But it'll only put me in the vicinity.
也许我可以帮忙 Maybe I could help.
如果我看到了那个地方 就会知道 If I see the place, I'll know it.
如果我们一起去会更方便 It will be easier if we're together.
去吧 Go.
找到它 Find it.
就是这了 This is it.
就在这里 It's here.
这些场景看起来眼熟吗?

不 No.
我记得有扇红色的门 I remember a red door.
还以为你会快乐点 至少更安心 Thought you'd be happier.

一切都恢复原有的样子了 Things are getting back to the way they were.
你真这么认为吗?

还是说你希望如果你原谅科尔森 Or do you hope that if you forgive Coulson,
亨特也会同样原谅你?

你说过瑞娜会操纵人心 You said Raina's manipulative.
但是她危险吗?

那要看你怎么定义"危险"了 That depends on how you define "dangerous".
她说服戈尔工和斯凯去救林肯 She convinced Gorgon and Skye to go after Lincoln
即使他们俩都清楚那样做并不安全 even though they knew it wasn't safe.
黛西很强大 遗传自你 Daisy's strong.

但要是她出点什么事 我会亲自 But if she's not okay, I will personally
撕破瑞娜的毒妇心肠!

也可以不这样做 Or not.
你...

你最初遇到她的时候她是个什么样的人?

她一无所有...

不知怎地 她却能让咖啡店店主 Somehow, she convinced this caffe owner
给她一些不新鲜的糕点...

还说服了一个裁缝给她 persuaded a tailor to give her
一些边角布料这样她能做一条裙子 leftover fabric so she could make dresses.
她可真机智 Resourceful.
但是自私 Selfish.
不久 她就要求给她热乎乎的新鲜糕点 Soon, she demanded the warm, fresh pastries,
而不是那些残羹冷炙 not the stale ones.
如果他们愿意给她一些棉花 为什么不给她丝绸呢?

我还没见过她没有欲望的样子 I've never seen her not want something.
你认为她现在想要什么?

我好羡慕你 因为佳英需要你 I've envied you because Jiaying needs you.
你可以带人进出"来世" You bring people in and out of Afterlife.
我只不过是个烦恼 I'm just an annoyance.
你说得不对 你的天赋无人能比 Oh, that's not true.

我从来没见过那样的能力 I've never seen anything like it.
但我不是被选中的 But I wasn't chosen.
她为什么只让那么少的人通过迷雾呢?

站住!

我去...

是传送者 It's the teleporter.
他们在下甲板 是想去拿货物 They're going for the cargo on the lower deck.
他们知道我们来了 我们得走了 They know we're here.

戈尔工 就是这了 Gorgon, this is it.
等等 Wait.
这样不安全 It's not safe.
我们当时就该趁有机会的时候毁了它 Should have destroyed it when we had the chance.
你知道我们不能冒这个险 You know we couldn't risk it.
不确定因素太多 There were too many variables.
这就是外星物体?

这是一百年前从一个考古现场发现的 Recovered from a dig site nearly a hundred years ago.
它的能源体征和我们之前见过的都不同 Its energy signatures are unlike anything we've seen before.
嗯 Mm.
有人知道它是从哪个外星世界来的 And does anyone have any idea what alien world it came from
是用来干什么的吗?

这个新的神盾局 Oh, this new S.

智囊团似乎工作得很有效率 Brain Trust seems to be working out brilliantly.
弗瑞的工具箱里有它的资料吗?

只知道海德拉在找它 Just that Hydra was looking for it.
现在又新来一伙人打它的主意了 Well, now you have a new interested party.
问题是为什么?

我不知道 I have no idea.
说真的 我从没听说过这样的事 Seriously, I have never heard of anything like that before,
林肯也一样 and neither has Lincoln.
你相信他吗?

为什么不相信他呢?

你甚至不了解他 You barely know him.
他和佳英帮过我 知道这就足够了 I know enough.

他们从没伤害过我 They never tried to hurt me.
他...

让我不会伤害到自己 so I wasn't hurting myself.
那些人是好人 科尔森 These are good people, Coulson.
是吗?

听着 我知道你和这个群体很有共鸣 Look, I know you feel connected to this group,
但你不会告诉我们太多有关他们的事 but you won't tell us much about them,
你把这些事藏在心里...

我一直在照顾林肯 I've been taking care of Lincoln.
好吧 但从我们的角度来看 Okay, but from our perspective,
我们甚至不知道怎么称呼他们 we don't even know what to call them.
异人族 Inhumans.
我们的祖先自称"异人族" Our ancient ancestors called themselves inhumans,
我们只是不想被人打扰 and we just want to be left alone.
"我们"?

如果他们不想被人打扰 If they want to be left alone,
那他们为什么入侵军舰?

你们认为那是一种武器 You're assuming that this thing is a weapon.
它在神盾局的手里 Well, it's in S.

也许他们只是害怕它...

害怕冈萨雷斯会利用它做什么 afraid of what Gonzales might do with it.
我们不是敌人 We're not the enemy here.
这个男人凭空把人传送到了船上 斯凯 This man teleported onboard, Skye.
很明显他十分危险 He's clearly very dangerous.
那句话同样适用于你 梅 Well, same could be said about you, May.
我听说了在巴林发生在那个小女孩身上的事 I heard about what happened to that little girl in Bahrain.
佳英把整件事都告诉我了 Jiaying told me the whole story.
你知道她是异人族吗?

他们都是 They both were.
所以在所有人里 你应该是最理解 So you, of all people, should understand
他们为什么不想公开自己的聚居地...

他们为什么如此害怕 what they're so afraid of.
货舱安全 Cargo hold's secure.
或者说只是尽力看守周全了 毕竟有个传送者 Or as secure as it can be with a teleporter in the mix.
我们不需要等到异人族们来找我们 We no longer have to wait for the inhumans to come to us.
还记得海德拉是怎么追踪传送者的吗?

我重建了那套设备 I was able to rebuild that device.
用了死亡战士眼球的扫描 Using this scan from Deathlok's eye.
这话是什么意思?

当传送者离开货舱的时候...

我们可以追踪他的生命体征 se were able to follow his signature.
- 你们知道他们在哪?

我认为是时候向我们的新朋友打个招呼了 I think it's time we pay our new friends a visit.
我们的进攻计划是什么?

谁说我们要进攻了?

- 这些人都是威胁

我们对他们一无所知 We don't know anything about them.
除了知道他们找到了我们的基地 Except for the fact that they found our base
以及我们的航母 and our aircraft carrier.
现在他们就可以把自己传送到这个房间 They could teleport into this room right now
丢个炸弹再走 and leave a bomb behind.
我们都看到了斯凯的能力 We've seen what Skye's capable of.
林肯可以使我们的整个系统短路 Lincoln could short out our entire system.
我理解你们的担忧 I understand your concerns,
但我们最不想做的就是挑起战争 but the last thing we need is to start a war.
拜托 我们才刚打完一场 We just finished one, for god's sake.
必须采取行动了 菲尔 Action needs to be taken, Phil.
所以我想向他们的女领袖佳英提议 Which is why I'm proposing a sit

面对面谈谈 this woman Jiaying.
这次是实情调查任务 We'll call it a fact

需要获得他们的同意才行 They'd need to agree to that first.
我们可以利用斯凯这个中间人 她毕竟是个神盾局特工 We could use Skye as a liaison.

她还是吗?

当然是了 Of course it is.
终于可以搞清楚斯凯到底站在哪边了 Now's a good time to find out where Skye really stands.
所以真的在他们手里 So they do have it.
被他们锁在船的深处 Deep in their ship, under lock and key.
只是暂时的 For now.
听起来好像有人知道些我们不知道的事 Sounds like somebody knows something we don't.
佳英 这与他无关 Jiaying, this doesn't concern him.
有 有 当然有关 Yes.

我们的女儿很可能现在仍在神盾局里 Our daughter is probably still with S.

你难道忘了 Or did you forget
是你把她带到他们门口的?

卡尔 别这么激动 Cal, don't lose your head.
得了吧 Oh, come off it.
这种演技...

你想...

用你看到的"幻象"保护他们?

我们怎么知道你不是在胡编乱造?

她所看到的一切都成了现实 Everything she's seen has come true.
她所拥有的这种力量...

你认为我想干什么?

我不知道 制造混乱吗?

- 我为什么要那么做?

后退 Back off.
卡尔 别这样...

你想怎么样 卡尔?

你不吃那种混合药剂 就一无是处 Without that concoction that you take, you're nothing.
那些小瓶子里的到底是什么?

- 蛋白粉?

神盾局想让我们感到害怕 让我们分裂 S.

但现在我们团结一心...

已经有几千年前的历史 A history that goes back thousands of years.
他们无法将这个从我们手上夺走 They will not take that away from us.
不 你不可以去那 No, you cannot go there.
听着 保密是他们最看重的事 Listen, secrecy is what they value most.
我们无法忽视他们的存在 We can't ignore their existence.
- 他们并没有忽视我们

听着 最起码 Look, at the very least,
我们得知道他们到底有多少人 we need to find out how many people we're dealing with,
评估他们的力量 把他们加入名单 assess their powers, place them on the Index.
你知道程序的 你是个神盾局特工 You know how this works.

我...

好吧 那么...

让我和林肯先回去 let Lincoln and I go first.
他们可能很担心我们 They're probably worried about us.
我会和佳英谈谈 解释你来的原因 I'll talk to Jiaying, explain why you're coming,
说明你只想帮忙 that you just want to help.
她会听的 She'll listen.
你怎么知道她会听?

因为她是我的妈妈 Because she's my mother.
我们要把她关起来?

- 别告诉我你同情她

格兰特·沃德也一样 So was Grant Ward.
听着 等她盗用过你的脸了 我们就能谈这话题了 Look, when she takes your face, then we can talk.
你不该在没人监察的时候运动 Hmm.

我的监察员总是迟到 My spotter's always late.
我得练习我的演讲 Needed to practice my speech.
不管你说什么都改变不了我的想法 芭芭拉 Nothing you say is gonna change my mind, Barbara.
你知道的 有些事本可以不一样 Things could be different, you know.
有时候 混乱能带来秩序 Sometimes, anarchy brings order.
我最爱的空想主义者 My favorite idealist.
你和亨特聊过了吗?

他仍然没正眼看过我 He still hasn't looked me in the eye.
等他正眼看我的三天后 就会准备好和我谈了 About three days after that, he'll be ready to talk.
你们俩的关系太糟糕了 You two are messed up.
掐他脖子的人可没资格说这话 Says the guy who put him in a choke hold.
虽然他很快就原谅了你 Though he's been pretty quick to forgive you.
他在利用我使你生气 你知道的 对吗?

亨特的意图总是很显而易见 Hunter's always worn his heart on his sleeve.
我不知道怎么能做到 I don't know how to do that.
也许是我有毛病 Maybe something's wrong with me.
轮到我了 I think I'm up.
我想念我的飞机了 I miss my plane.
我也一样 Me, too.
不过如果你转念想想 Though, if you think about it,
最可怕的事就发生在那架飞机上 mostly terrible stuff happened on that thing.
我和斯凯说过了 I spoke to Skye.
她一直挂在嘴边的那个女人 佳英...

是她的妈妈 It's her mother.
我本来还期待你会惊讶 好吧 算了 I was expecting at least a raised eyebrow, but okay.
我会告诉理事会的 I'll tell the council.
梅...

我认为现在终于可以 I thought now would be a good time
好好向你道歉了 我承诺过的 to apologize to you, at length, as promised.
- 没必要这样做

我们两不相欠了 We don't owe each other anything.
嘿 Hey.
别这么说 That's not true.
听着 如果这是因为斯凯说的话...

- 不是

我不在乎在巴林发生的事 I don't care what happened in Bahrain.
不 你在乎 Yes, you do.
否则你也不会提起 Or you wouldn't bring it up.
那个姑娘不是在交火中丧命的 菲尔 That girl wasn't killed in the crossfire, Phil.
好吧 Okay.
当时是她和其他人之间的抉择 是我做的决定 It was her or everyone around us, and I made the call.
我只告诉了安德鲁 I only told Andrew.
那时候我们的界限很清晰 Back then, our boundaries were clear.
我嫁的是他 而你只是同事 I was married to him, and I worked with you.
梅林达...

你开始在墙上刻字的时候 When you started carving into that wall,
叮嘱我看着你...

并在你失控的时候杀了你 and put you down if you got out of control.
我永远不会对你开枪 但我当时真该制止你 I would never have shot you, but I should have stopped you.
我从未失控过 I never lost control.
斯凯就是你失控的最好证明 Skye is living proof that you did.
你把林肯编入名单了吗?

恩 不过呃 我是去拿...

我...

在巴士坠毁前 我抢救出来了 Snagged it off the Bus before it went down.
心想着你或许会喜...

总之 给你吧 Well, anyway, here you go.
谢谢你 Thank you.
对了 她...

但却不是你干的 But you're not doing anything.
所以挺好笑的 That's why it's funny.
该出发了 Time to go.
- 怎么样了?

他们就问了很多问题而已 They just asked a lot of questions.
但我很肯定你们在我昏迷的时候 But I'm sure you guys already have my blood
就已经抽取我的血样了吧?

- 这是惯例

我知道你经历了很多事 但你可以信任我们 I know you've been through a lot, but you can trust us.
你会明白的 You'll see.
所以要如何操作呢?

你们就磕一磕脚跟 You just click your heels together
小声说"没有地方胜过家?" and whisper, "There's no place like home"?
差不多吧 戈尔工解释过 Sort of, actually.

他能感知我们 He can sense us.
原理是叫量子纠缠的东西 然后呃...

对的 他...

只要我们没在你们附近 As long as we're nowhere near any of you guys.
好吧 明天见 Okay.

好的 Okay.
好的 Okay.
戈尔工!

戈尔工!

幸好你在这!

我又看到了幻象 I had another vision.
神盾局...

来这?

我看见昆式喷射机在向我们开火 I saw Quinjets raining fire on us.
"来世"一片火海 Afterlife in flames.
我们得警告佳英 We have to warn Jiaying.
不行 事情就是因这而起的 No.

不能让她和他们谈话 She can't be the one who talks to them.
佳英不能和神盾局见面 Jiaying can't meet with S.

如果不是佳英 那找谁?

或许应该让我来 Well, maybe it should be me.
怎么样了?

我们正在整理货箱 We're packing up the crates now.
一切还好吗?

当然不用 这不过是预防措施而已 Of course not.

好吧 Okay.
你还好吧?

很好 Yeah.
出了什么事?

很多事 但我很好 A lot.

神盾局的一名医生给他包扎过了 A doctor at S.

神盾局?

我们需要谈谈 We need to talk.
到恢复室去 Go to the recovery room.
让我们的医生好好检查一下 Have one of ours take a look at you.
来 把一切告诉我 Come.

你才刚刚开始喜欢上这里 And you were just beginning to like it here.
我们没必要搬走 神盾局也不想这样 We don't have to leave.

没什么需要改变 Nothing has to change.
有时我都忘了你年纪多轻 Sometimes, I forget how young you are.
请你坐下来和他谈谈吧 Please just sit down with him.
科尔森...

他是唯一一个照顾过我的人 He's the only person who's ever tried to take care of me.
还有...

就目前为止 他是我最亲近的人了 Until now, he's the closest I've had to family.
拜托了 妈 Please, mom.
韦弗特工 你和我一起坐昆式战斗机 Agent Weaver, you'll be with me on QJ36.
我们会降落在离其主建筑一定距离的地方 We'll land a good distance from their main buildings here.
我会先进去...

进去的人不该是你 You shouldn't be the one going in.
方便解释下吗?

你跟这事关系太深了 You're too close to this.
斯凯就好比是你的女儿 Skye's like a daughter to you,
而她母亲是这群人的领袖 and her mother is these people's leader.
我在利用私人关系 I'm banking on that personal connection
- 来确保大家的安全

这是神盾局有史以来 This is one of the greatest threats
面临的最大危机 S.

我同意 我们面对的是一群超能力者...

而且你一次次证明了 And you've proven time and again
你在处理斯凯的事情时无法保持客观 that you're not objective when it comes to Skye.
这是你的个人观点 不是事实 That's your opinion, not fact.
想要事实是吧?

奥创的创造 Ultron was created
是由于人们太过亲近托尼·斯塔克 because people were too close to Tony Stark.
他们被他的魅力遮蔽了双眼 他们太信任他了 They were blinded by his charm.

甚至毫不在意他在研究什么 Never even thought to look at what he was working on.
还有复仇者们...

乃至整个世界几乎为之毁灭 and the world was almost destroyed for it.
我们是神盾局 We're S.

我们能做得更好 至少我们应该做得更好 We're better than that.

梅?

你今天静得出奇 You're awfully quiet.
应该让冈萨雷斯去 Gonzales should go.
那好吧 Okay, then.
是我让你留下 提供建议的 I asked you to stay and give me advice.
我若不采纳便是傻瓜 I'd be a fool not to take it.
作为局长 我会留守在这指挥行动 As Director, I'll quarterback the mission from here.
冈萨雷斯和韦弗 乘坐36号昆式战斗机 Gonzales and Weaver, you're on QJ36.
你确定编录不需要任何帮助吗?

你难道想要帮忙吗?

你上次险些丧命 You almost died last time.
上次是海德拉和沃德 Last time was Hydra and Ward.
即便那样也没出大岔子 And even that worked out mostly okay.
你其实不该对沃德过意不去 You know, you shouldn't feel bad about Ward.
我也想...

杀他 Kill him, too.
但我下不了手 And I couldn't.
这就说明我们比他好 Means we're better than him.
我的确试着要杀他 菲兹 I did try to kill him, Fitz,
而且我为自己的失败很是自责 and I'm kicking myself that I failed.
他要再做坏事 那就是我的错 The next terrible thing he does is on me.
波比 科尔森想让我们在前探路 Bobbi, Coulson wants us to scout ahead.
坐标已经锁定 Already locked in the coordinates.
迈克 Mack.
你不应该跟冈萨雷斯和韦弗一起在下面吗?

我从未在你面前拐弯抹角过 长官 I never minced words with you before, sir,
我现在也不打算做 and I'm not going to now.
我想离开 I'm leaving.
即便希尔塔协议到头来是架天空母舰 The fact that Theta protocol turned out to be a helicarrier
对我来说还是一样 doesn't change things for me.
弗瑞让你起死回生 Fury brought you back from the dead,
为此用了外星人的血 and he used alien blood to do it.
而你的遭遇不能完全怪你 And you can't be blamed for what happened to you,
但你也不值得信任 but you can't be trusted, either.
我不受任何人控制 I'm in full control of my actions.
我也浅尝过被外星人控制的感觉 I had my own brush with something alien,
我知道最好不要搅和进不能理解的事物里 And I know better than to mess with things I can't understand.
但似乎你还没有认识到这点 But it seems like you haven't learned that lesson.
我会把你调到冈萨雷斯手下的航空母舰去 I'll have you reassigned to the carrier, under Gonzales.
不用 No.
虽然我很爱戴并且尊重您 长官 As much as I like and respect you, sir,
如果你是神盾局的局长 if you're the director of S.

我就不想牵扯进来 I don't want any part in it.
我会去舰船那里 但是...

是为了收拾我的东西 it'll be to collect my things.
你在神盾局待了大概13年吧?

失去你真是遗憾 I'm sorry to lose you.
好了 准备出动战斗机 All right, let's get those jets in the air.
神盾局?

不能让他们来 你不能答应 They cannot come here.

我没得选择 I don't have a choice.
抱歉 这个看起来年代很久了 Oh.

年...

卡尔 你见识过这些人 Cal, you've met these people.
老实告诉我...

我只认识其中几位 I only know a few of them,
没一个我喜欢的 none of whom I've enjoyed.
菲尔·科尔森是我最讨厌的 但...

他的确很关心我们的黛西 he does care about our Daisy.
她告诉我一个叫名单的东西 She was telling me about something called the Index.
名单?

不不不 No, no, no.
他们会把你们打上标签...

你们有超能力...

做什么呢?

把它们的飞机炸飞?

可以从这个开始 Well, for a start.
我们的女儿不会想看到这个 Our daughter wouldn't want that.
我的族人也不会盲目追随我开战 And my people would never blindly follow me into a war.
我会 I would.
这么多人因岁月而变得拘谨...

你还像我初遇你时那样狂妄不羁 You're as bold as the day I met you.
我现在在你眼里一定是个老人吧 I must look like an old man to you now.
不是 No.
这张脸就是我当初爱上的那张面孔 This is the same face I fell in love with.
是我改变了 It's me who's changed.
我们不能再让这些人夺走我们的女儿 We can't lose our daughter to these people again.
他们惧怕我们 惧怕我们的能力 They're terrified of us, of our powers.
我要如何去让他们相信我们并无恶意呢?

把我交给他们 Give me to them.
他们认为我是个杀人犯 而我某种意义上确实是 They think I'm a murderer, which is technically true.
把我交给他们吧 Let them have me.
神盾局最喜欢把人收押入监了 S.

到处是欢呼声 High fives all around.
卡尔 我不能...

让我弥补过去 来保护我的家人吧 Let me protect my family the way I couldn't before.
拜托了 Please.
迈克今天离队了 Mack quit today.
想过如果没有神盾局 你会是什么样的人吗?

实际上 我最近经常在考虑这个问题 Actually, been giving that a lot of thought recently.
你呢?

亨特曾经叫我和他一起退出神盾局 Hunter asked me to leave once, to be with him.
那是我唯一一次被说动想要离开 It was the one time I was tempted to walk away.
你真的要让亚哈船长一瘸一拐走进去 You're really gonna let Captain Ahab just waltz in there
和斯凯的妈妈来一次炉边谈话吗?

是的 不过你这个说法好奇怪 I am, though that is a really strange way of putting it.
如果委员会错了呢?

我是说 冈萨雷斯还从没...

菲兹 我们的对手不是委员会 It's not the council versus us, Fitz.
不再是那样了 Not anymore.
而且他们是正确的 And they're right.
我不是每一次都能做出正确的决断 I haven't always made the right call,
尤其是在和斯凯有关的事情上 especially when it comes to Skye.
如果我不相信他们 If I don't put my faith in them,
那神盾局会再一次四分五裂的 then S.

我不想说破 Hate to break it to you,
但是如果一堆愤怒的超能力者 but S.

向我们发动攻击的话 神盾局还是会分崩离析的 if a dozen angry enhanced blokes rain terror on us all.
没错 Yeah.
我觉得我们在一起呆得够久了 I think we've been spending too much time together.
戈尔工 Gorgon.
怎么了?

你找到我们的保险方案了吗?

花了我一些功夫 Took some digging,
我希望以后再发生这样的事你能多给我点提示 and I'd appreciate a bit more notice in the future.
离目的地10分钟 10 minutes out.
明白 梅特工 Copy that, Agent May.
嘿 梅 我转自动驾驶降落了 Hey, May, autopilot has us descending.
你确定坐标没有问题吗?

可笑的是你对于背叛亨特这件事情感到这么心碎 Funny how you're so broken up about betraying Hunter.
因为你看起来丝毫不在意 'Cause it seems like you couldn't care less
你曾经对我做的一切 about what you did to me.
卡拉 Kara.
你就坐在那里 假装是在安抚我 You just sat there, pretending to comfort me.
但实际上是在试探我有没有回忆起什么 But you were just trying to see if I remembered.
我想起来了 Well, I do.
长官 人数比我们预计的要多得多 Sir, there are a lot more unknowns than we anticipated.
如果斯凯完成了她的任务 他们的领袖同意会面 If Skye's done her job and their leader agrees to meet,
那剩下的交给我就好 I'll handle the rest.
系好安全带 五分钟后着陆 Lock in.

我一直觉得我的人生是为了创造些什么...

我有自己的使命 that I had a purpose.
知道活着的意义感觉真好 It's nice to finally see what it is.
你把佳英带去哪了?

我不希望她被放到让她不舒服的地方 I would hate for her to be someplace uncomfortable.
有些人认为你身上的变化是一种诅咒 Some would call your transformation a curse.
但是在"来世" 我们认为这是一种天赋 But at Afterlife, we choose to call it a gift.
为什么呢?

用别人的看法来决定我们是谁 the way that others see us to define who we are.
但是你却用你的能力去操纵你周围的人 But you have used your powers to manipulate those around you,
而且还利用了我的善意 and you've taken advantage of my good faith.
不是的 你一定要听我说 No.

别说了 Don't.
你永远是这样 It's the same with you every time.
不是的 我是为了拯救我们 No, it's not.

瑞娜 任何认识你的人都不相信你 There's not a single soul that knows you who trusts you, Raina.
把她关在这里 直到神盾局的人离开 Keep her here until S.

之后我们再来决定你的命运 Then we'll decide your fate.
你一定要相信我 You have to believe me.
如果你不照我说的做 会发生很恐怖的事情!

你会后悔的 You'll regret this.
科尔森在哪?

在总部 At headquarters.
而我代表神盾局传达他的意思 But I represent S.

我要问的是 为什么他会在这里 I might ask why he's here, though.
你们把林肯和斯凯还给了我们 You returned Lincoln and Skye to us.
我们想把一个你们想要的人给你们 We'd like to return someone of interest to you.
他杀了很多神盾局特工 不是吗?

不 不是神盾局特工 Uh, no.

我不觉得他们是 I don't think.
只是些...

我们为能做出正确的事情而感到骄傲 We pride ourselves on doing the right thing.
尽管这让我感到很痛苦 我能理解这是为了更远大的目标 And as much as this pains me, I do understand the larger goal.
我会叫我手下的人来带走他 I'll call one of my people to take him.
斯凯可以带走他 Skye can.
你能把你父亲带到外面的特工那里去吗?

我相信这位...

冈萨雷斯 叫我罗伯特吧 Gonzales, Robert.
罗伯特先生和我有很多需要商议 Robert and I have much to discuss.
你知道吗 要见到你的时候我一直很激动 You know, I was always excited to meet you.
即便是你还那么小 Even when you were a little bit of nothing
在你母亲肚子里的时候 in your mother's belly.
我一直在脑海里想象 Oh, I had all these ideas in my head
你将来会变成怎么样的人 然后...

你真的很出色 You really are magnificent.
我很庆幸我能有机会了解你 I'm very grateful I got a chance to know you.
我也很高兴能了解你 I'm glad I got to know you, too.
斯凯告诉我海德拉对你做了什么 Skye told me what Hydra did to you.
真是可耻 It's shameful.
如果说活了这么久让我学到了什么 If a long life has taught me anything,
那就是你永远想不到 It's that you can never truly be prepared
人们能做出什么事情来 for what people are capable of.
海德拉也从我这里夺走了很多 Hydra took from me, too.
我们受了同样的伤害 We share the same scars,
重要的是你知道我们和他们不一样 but it's important that you know that we are not them.
我有个东西要给你 I have something for you.
打开它吧 Go on.

科尔森怎么了?

他们对他做了什么吗?

我们都认为让一个能客观对待此事的人 We all felt that it was best to have someone more objective
去见你母亲会更好 to meet with your mother.
冈萨雷斯几周之前还曾派人来杀我 Gonzales sent people to kill me a few weeks ago.
他比你想象你要好得多 He's a much better man than you think.
那你呢?

我说了 我们需要能保持客观的人来处理 I told you, we needed someone objective.
我知道怀特霍尔让你处于难以描述的恐惧之中 I know that Whitehall subjected you to unspeakable horrors,
他夺走了你的一切 that he took everything from you.
一个好人 菲尔·科尔森 一枪打死了他 A good man, Phil Coulson, put a bullet in him.
你们从哪儿...

神盾局在怀特霍尔死后 从他的办公室里 S.

取回来的 after his death.
我知道你和你女儿被分开了 I know that you were separated from your daughter.
我认为那也许是属于她的东西 I thought that that might belong to her.
驱赶恶灵的中国传统礼物 不是吗?

我从来没有机会把这个送给她的 I never got a chance to give it to her.
我一直希望如果她还活着的话 I kept hoping that if she was alive,
邪恶的人永远不会找上她 evil would never find her.
不会像我一样 Not like it did me.
我希望你母亲和你所想的一样 I hope your mother is everything you wanted her to be.
神盾局一直和超能力人类之间的联系很漫长 S.

有时候很暴力 但事实是 with enhanced people, but the truth is,
有时候得到能力的是好人 有时候是坏人 sometimes good people get powers, and sometimes bad.
当坏人得到力量时 需要我们来保护大众 We're there to protect the public when it's the latter.
你想要我怎么帮助你?

我想要见见你的族人 I would like to meet your people,
了解他们的能力 learn about their powers.
我们会做记录 如果有人尝试做出有害的事情 We'll keep a record, and if any ever try to do someone harm,
我们会阻止他们 we'll be there to stop them.
这是神盾局存在的意义 That's why S.

我这里有一份回礼...

是会让你感兴趣的东西 something that might interest you.
可能是有必要收入名单的东西 May even be worth indexing.
那是你们的叫法 对吗?

在我漫长的一生中 我发现有无数的人 I have lived enough life to see countless people
都因他们的特殊而被侧目 profiled for their differences.
让我惊讶的是 多少代人 It's amazing how many generations
都掉进了同一个陷阱里 fall into the same trap.
究竟是什么让人觉得 What is it that makes people feel
他们有资格这么做?

恐惧 应该就是这个 Fear.

神盾局的目标是保护所有人 S.

他们把卡尔交给我们了 They turned over Cal.
等你们回到总部 我们再处理他 We'll deal with him when you get back to H.

我们在他身上发现了这些小瓶子 长官 We found these vials on him, ma'am.
这些是什么?

我也不知道 Beats me.
恐惧会让我们做出一些 Fear drives us to do things
平时绝对做不出的事情 we would otherwise never do.
这就是为什么我开始用 That's why I first started experimenting
泰瑞根水晶做实验 with Terrigen crystals.
我们手里只有五个占卜者 We only had five Diviners in our possession.
我知道如果它们被摧毁的话 I knew if they were destroyed,
我们就会失去转化的能力...

整个种族彻底消失 An entire race gone forever.
所以我们决定创造的占卜者 So we decided to make our own.
就像有些人说的 As some have said,
科学发现需要实践 discovery requires experimentation.
最终 我们融化了一个占卜者 Eventually, we melted a diviner down
并从中提炼出了新的水晶 and grew new crystals from it.
不幸的是 我们没能完全 Unfortunately, we could never quite separate
把占卜者的金属分离出来 the Diviner metal out.
它们包含在了水晶里 It's now laced within them.
看到了吗?

当然 这对异人族来说不是个问题 This wasn't a problem for inhumans, of course.
占卜者对我们是无害的 The Diviner's harmless to us.
但是对人类嘛...

希望你是我们的一员吧 Let's hope you're one of us.
不!

你怎么敢把你的伤疤和我的相提并论 How dare you compare your scars to mine?
你和我们完全不同 You're nothing like me, like us.
怀特霍尔把我解剖了 Whitehall cut me to pieces.
他挖出我的脏器 然后塞进瓶子里 He ripped out my organs and stuffed them in jars.
我永远不会让这些发生在我女儿...

或是任何族人身上 to any of my people.
你会害死所有人的 你个疯子...

妈妈?

妈!

妈!

他想要杀了我 He tried to kill me.
神盾局想要杀了我 S.

这...

妈!

莫尔斯特工 请汇报位置 Agent Morse, what's your 20?
莫尔斯特工!

你干得很好 宝贝 You did good, baby.
把他们都骗过了 Fooled every one of them.
没有你在的日子很难熬 It was hard being away from you.
我们还是在一起的好 It's better when we're together.
为什么不能现在就把她杀了?

想了结这一切没那么简单 Closure's about so much more than that.
必须要更加深入 完成任务 It's about digging in, doing the work.
我会做给你看的 I'll show you what I mean.
在那之后我们才能杀了她 And then we'll kill her.
她要醒了 She's waking up.
我们可不希望那样 We don't want that.
