AMC台"行尸走肉" 前情提要...

我应该杀了我老婆的 I was suppose to kill my wife.
但我做不到 But I couldn't do it.
然后她就这么把他吃了 And then she was just on him.
你觉得他疯了吗?

不 我觉得他很危险 No, I think he's dangerous.
为什么?

因为所有生命都是珍贵的 Because all life is precious.
有一群人翻墙闯进来了 Some group got inside the walls.
他们正在屠杀 They're killing people.
Carol啊!

你不需要杀了他们 You don't have to kill.
我当然要杀 Of course we do.
我不怎么会用枪 I'm not very good with guns.
我也不会 Me neither.
此刻
你说过你喜欢聊天 You said you liked talking.
我还记得 I remember that.
"在火堆旁和陌生人谈天" "Little chats with a stranger by the fire."
你说这种感觉就和电影一样 You said it was like the movies.
你还说过你想要我所拥有的一切 Then you said that you want everything that I have.
每一样 Every last bit.
那么 就是这样 Well, here it is.
毫无保留 Every last bit.
彼刻
清理
你没有清理 You don't clear.
你没有 You don't.
不 No.
不 不 No, no.
你没有 You don't.
你没有 You don't.
清理
到底几天还是几小时...

都不重要 or how much time.
我们就不应该在那儿 We weren't supposed to be there.
你有刀 You had the knife.
还有枪!

你应该那么做 You were supposed to.
你应该那么做 You were supposed to.
你不在此处 此处非此处
你知道你应该那么做的 You know you were supposed to.
别撒谎 Don't lie.
你知道的 You know.
你知道你应该那么做的!

行尸走肉 第六季第4集
清理
对不...

对不起 对不起 I'm sorry.

不要!

你不是真心 你不是真心 You don't.

你不是真心!

无意义的行为
此处非此处
清理
你还是老样子 You're still the same.
你...

你知道我指什么 You know what it is.
你知道我指什么 You know what it is.
你能离那只羊远点吗?

她不是你的 我还需要她 She's not yours.

我还在摸索怎么做奶酪 I'm still figuring out how to make cheese.
你为什么不能把枪放下 我们好好谈谈?

要吃点炸丸子吗?

你看上去好像很久没吃东西了 Looks like you haven't eaten for a while.
我说真的 把枪放下 咱们谈谈 Really, put down the rifle, let's talk.
肯定有办法共处 I'm sure we can work this out.
好吧 最后一次机会 Okay, last chance.
放下枪 离屋子远点 Lower your gun, step away from the cabin.
对不起 Sorry.
你叫什么?

杀了我 Kill me.
好吧 这名字够傻的 Well, that's a stupid name.
还很危险 It's dangerous.
你应该换一个 You should change it.
杀了我 Kill me.
杀了我!

杀了我!

杀了我!

和平的艺术
杀了我 Kill me.
我叫Eastman My name's Eastman.
没事的 Tabitha It's okay, Tabitha.
噢 该死 Aw, shit.
这是你该干的 It's yours.
去做吧 Take it.
要么你来做 要么是他 It's yours or his.
所以你就去做吧 So you take it.
19个小时有16个小时在地上 16 hours in 19 on the floor.
你知道这意味着什么 You know what it is.
你朝我开枪 我还给你吃的 You shot at me.

所以请别伤害她 Please don't hurt her.
晚安 Good night.
19个小时有16个小时在地上 16 hours in 19 on the floor.
噢!

天哪 这味道...

这味道太糟糕了!

这...

这太难吃了 that is terrible.
我只是想在谈话前让你冷静一段时间 I just wanted to wait a little while before we talked.
我来自亚特兰大 I'm from Atlanta.
是一名司法精神病学家 I'm a forensic psychiatrist.
州政府雇我鉴定那些 The state employed me to determine
穷凶极恶的罪犯被放出去后 if certain people who did very bad things would do them again
是否还会再犯事 if they were released from prison.
那是我以前的工作 现在我住在这里 That was my job.

因为全州还有全世界 Because of the state of the state
都这副模样 and the whole world.
你以前或者你现在是干什么的?

清理 I clear.
那是什么意思?

行尸 人 Walkers, people,
任何接近我的东西 anything that gets anywhere near me,
格杀勿论 I kill 'em.
我清理他们 I clear.
为什么?

因为那是我能存活至今的原因 Because that's why I'm still here.
好吧...

这是我听过最臭的屁话 that's the biggest load of horseshit I ever heard.
这是你的午餐 Here's your lunch.
你这是创伤后压力症 It's PTSD.
你受过精神创伤 对吗?

你看到我棍子一头上的血了吗?

锋利的那一头?

是两个男人的血 That was two men.
也许是父子 Father and son, maybe.
我戳穿了一个的喉咙 I stabbed one through the throat.
他就带着那根棍子倒在地上 He just fell to the ground with it stuck in him
奋力在血海中呼吸 trying to breathe through the blood.
另一个是我勒死的 没用绳子 直接用手 Other one I strangled.

就在我来这的前一天 That was the day before I came here.
或许...

或许就是同一天 maybe the same day.
我...

不过我确实那么干了 But that's what I did.
我就是那么干事的 That's what I do.
你杀过很多人吗?

是的 Yes.
他们威胁到你 或者攻击你了吗?

不是每个人 Not all of them.
你救过人吗?

你救过人 You saved people.
无意义的行为 Pointless acts.
大家都会变成行尸的 Everybody turns.
我看见了你的婚戒 I saw a wedding ring.
你有过爱人 不是吗?

有孩子吗?

你爱他们 You loved them.
你变成这样就是因为你太爱他们了 You loved them a lot if you're like this.
你目睹了悲剧的发生 You saw it happen.
那就是一切的源头 对吧?

那些事一遍遍在你眼前回放 It's all happening right in front of your eyes over and over.
你的身体在这里 Your body's here,
可灵魂却还停在那一刻 but your mind is still there.
那里有扇门 你想穿过它 There's a door and you want to go through it
逃离它 而你穿过去之后 to get away from it, so you do
它却带你回到了那一刻 and it leads you right back to that moment.
你再次看见那扇门 And you see that door again
你知道那不是出路 and you know it won't work,
可是又想 该死 或许这次能行呢?

所以你穿过那扇门 So you step through that door
一次次地回到那个可怕的时刻 and you're right back in that horrible moment every time.
一次次地去感受那悲伤 You still feel it every time.
后来你决定不再去碰那扇门 So you just want to stop opening that door.
你放弃了 不再抵抗 So you just sit in it.
可我向你保证 But I assure you,
其中会有一扇门是通向外面的 我的朋友 one of those doors leads out, my friend.
我才没有什么朋友 I don't have any friends.
那我们该认识认识 Get to know me.
我要杀了你 Oh, I'm gonna kill you.
- 为什么?

看 这就是问题所在 你不需要清理 See, that's the thing.

我们不是为杀戮而生 We're not built to kill.
我们没有爪子 没有獠牙 没有盔甲 We don't have claws or fangs or armor.
归来的士兵会有创伤后压力症 Vets that came back with PTSD,
就是因为我们内心并不喜欢杀人 that didn't happen because we're comfortable with killing.
我们不会喜欢 也不能喜欢 We're not.

我们感同身受 连为一体 We feel.

跟你说 我曾经面谈过大约825个犯下 You know, I've interviewed over 825 people
滔天罪行的人 who've done terrible things.
而仅有一个人是真正邪恶的 I've only met one evil person.
有些人是一出生脑子就有问题 Some of them were born with bad brains.
有些人是被带坏的 Some of them got sick along the way.
剩下的只是受过创伤的人 The rest were just damaged people.
就像你一样伤害自己 但他们可以治愈 Traumatized themselves like you, but they could heal.
或多或少 可是他们能恢复 Some more, some less, but they can.
我们都可以的 We all can.
我知道的 I know it.
这世间因果循环 报应不爽 It's all a circle and everything gets a return.
门是开着的 The door is open.
这个门 这个监牢的门 是开着的 That door right there.

我把钥匙扔进河里有一段时间了 I threw the key in the river a while back.
我不会再关着你了 I'm not gonna hold you anymore.
我不能阻止你 去吧 去清理吧 I can't stop you.

要么就留下来 窝在沙发上 Or stay, crash on the couch,
我们可以给你找到另一条活路 and we'll try to find you another way.
门是开着的 The door's open.
一直都开着 It's been open all along.
去留随你 You stay or you go.
都由你自己决定 Those are the choices.
我不会让你干掉我的 I will not allow you to kill me.
想都别想 I will not allow that.
停下 Stop.
停下 Stop.
我给了你两个选择 I gave you two choices.
该死 Oh, shit.
杀了我 Kill me.
我给了你两个选择 I gave you two choices.
走出去或者坐沙发上 The door or the couch.
那是日本合气道武术 That was aikido.
我早前就是用它把你打晕的 That's how I kicked your ass earlier.
或者说 我就是用它借力打你的 Well, that's how I redirected your ass.
我为州里评估过的那些犯人 The people in prison I evaluated for the state,
我听过他们口中的故事 the stories I heard,
听过他们犯下的罪行 the things these people did.
有一天晚上 我五岁的女儿 One night, my five

发现我在车库大哭 灌下了大概八瓶啤酒 found me crying in the garage after about eight beers.
我告诉她我觉得不太舒服 Told her I wasn't feeling too good.
她给了我这个 She gave me this.
这是那天她在学校嘉年华赢的 She had won it at a carnival at school that day.
她说这东西会带给我好运 我会好起来的 She said it'd make me lucky and I'd feel better.
第二天早上 我看见了一张合气道培训的传单 The next morning I found a flyer for aikido.
那玩意真的有用 Damn thing worked.
你的老婆和孩子...

她们死了 they're dead.
是合气道救了我 It was aikido.
它也能帮你 It'll help.
显而易见 你需要帮助 And you obviously need help
我们才能出远门 if we're gonna make this trip.
这世上不可能只有我们两个 Can't just be me and you to the end.
和你聊天一点也没意思 You're a shit conversationalist.
可我没法独自出门 and I can't make this trip by myself.
去哪?

我也不知道 I have no idea.
晚安 Good night.
这个草的味道太重了点 Grassy notes are a little too Astroturf,
不过还是有希望的 but there's potential here.
什么都是有希望的 There is always potential.
只要有生命 就会有希望 Where there's life, there's potential.
我已经当了一阵子的素食主义者了 I've been a vegetarian for a while now.
我怕那只该死的山羊会让我成为素食者 I was afraid that damn goat was gonna make me a vegan.
我不杀生 但我无论如何不会放弃巧克力 I don't kill, but I'm not giving up on chocolate any time soon.
可能你发现了 我一直给你送来巧克力脆饼 You might notice I'm not giving up on the Goo Goo Clusters.
下一餐还会有它们 They're gonna remain on the menu.
你应该来一个的 味道棒极了 You should try one.

拜托 你是活人 要有点活力 Come on, you're alive.

我们应该出去 We should go out.
我们有很多东西 We got a lot here,
但还应该多收集些路上用 but we should scavenge some things up for the trip.
你要一起来吗?

我出门的时候能帮我照看一下Tabitha吗?

你能帮我照看好它吗?

和平的艺术 "合气道意为不杀生
尽管所有的武道都有反对杀生的戒条
但它们中大多数会用某种原因来解释杀生的行为
而在合气道中 我们尽量完全避免杀生 即便对方罪恶深重"
今天 你弄坏了一株西红柿 Well, you maimed a tomato plant,
不过我能看出你是为了救羊 我的朋友 but it looks to me like you saved a goat today, my friend.
嘿 Hey.
谢谢你 Thank you.
有进步 Progress.
等一下 Just a second.
一个A计划 一个B计划 A and B.
A计划...

还压坏了一株好番茄苗子 laid waste to a perfectly good tomato plant.
你去把它修好 You got to fix it.
B计划...

我把你的矛修好了 Fixed your spear.
合气之道在于借劲 It's about redirecting.
巧避 Evading.
并且真正修养保护对手的精神 And actually caring about the welfare of your opponent.
所以你要先修养自己 So you have to care about yourself.
你要相信你的生命是珍贵的 You have to believe your life is precious,
所有的生命都是珍贵的 that all life is precious.
你要借旧想法之力 You have to redirect those thoughts,
重导人生之路 the history that tells you otherwise.
过去已成为过去 What we've done, we've done.
我们前行以避之 We evade it by moving forward
警示自己不再重蹈覆辙 with a code to never to do it again.
为此弥补 To make up for it.
由此接受真我 To still accept what we were.
嘿 Hey.
接受世人 To accept everyone.
庇护万物 To protect everyone.
若想护人 先要护己 And in doing that, protect yourself.
书写和平 To create peace.
为什么你的屋子里会有个牢房?

我和妻子一起建造了这地方 Built this place with my wife
就在我女儿出生前 a while before our daughter was born.
那时候可还没有牢房 It didn't have a cell back then.
那只是起居室的一部分 That was just the other side of the living room.
在工作中 我面谈过800多个男人和25个女人 In my job I interviewed over 800 men and 25 women
都犯过重罪 convicted of awful things.
暴露人性中最阴暗的一面 Stuff from the darkest part of the human soul.
当时我在评估一个 I was evaluating a man
叫Crighton Dallas Wilton的人 by the name of Crighton Dallas Wilton.
叫这名字的人 听起来就像开石油公司的 Name like that, sounded like he should own an oil company
带着个大帽子那种...

尽管犯下不可言说的罪行 他还是即将假释出来 Despite doing some truly unspeakable acts, he was up for parole.
他是我遇到过最讨人喜欢的混球 And he was one of the most damn likable people I had ever met.
他说的话都有哲理 他还去找心理医生 He said all the right things, he went to therapy.
他给监狱委员会写信 开展了一个项目 He wrote letters to the prison board to start a program
给候监室种花 to grow flowers for the waiting rooms
给州立医院 疗养院种花 in state hospitals, rest homes.
而我看穿了他 And I saw right through him.
他是个彻彻底底的精神变态 Saw that he was a true psychopath,
他知道怎么玩弄人心 知道得清清楚楚 that he knew how to play people, exactly how to play people.
我在咖啡馆隔壁跟他面谈 I was interviewing him next to the cafeteria.
那地方闻起来一股披萨味 The place smelled of industrial pizza.
他们在给地板抛光 They were polishing the floor.
大部分时间我要大声喊出问题 I had to shout my questions half the time.
就在那时 And there was this moment.
我已经记不住对话的内容了 Can't even remember the exchange.
但就在那刻我意识到 But right then I knew
Crighton很清楚 我知道他是什么人 that Crighton knew that I knew exactly what he was.
他所做所言 都是为了向所有人 Everything he had said, done to hide away
向他自己隐瞒自我 what he was from everyone, from himself,
就这么溜了出来 然后...

这个做了10年模范的囚犯站了起来 and that model prisoner of 10 years stood up,
微笑着 smiled,
朝我的脸上打了过来 and just cracked me across the face.
他的拳头像石头一样硬 His fist felt like a rock.
然后他骑到我身上 隔壁的地板抛光机 Then he was on top of me and the floor polisher next door
发出的噪音非常大 was thudding out every sound.
而我...

看着他的脸 and I saw his face,
他...

看穿了他的邪恶 his evil.
他伪装的面具终于脱落了 Mask had slipped.
他准备在那里就杀死我 And he was gonna kill me right then and there
因为他知道我会让他这辈子都出不了狱 because he knew I would make sure he would never get out again.
十字固击 Arm bar counter
用于被人锁住掐喉的情况 for being choked from a pinned position.
合气道技法 Aikido.
我学这个不是为了防身 I wasn't taking it for self

但却救了我一命 but it saved my life.
而我要确保他这辈子都没法出狱 And I got to make sure he never got out again.
至少得试试 Well, got to try.
但他还是出去了 He got out.
找对了人 搞到了工具 Talked to the right people who got him the right things
越狱出来 但不是为了逃走 and he broke out, but it wasn't to escape.
Crighton Dallas Wilton直接去了我家 Crighton Dallas Wilton went to my home
杀了我的妻子 我的女儿 还有我的儿子 and killed my wife, my daughter, and my son.
他沿着街走到了街角的警察局 He walked down the street to the police station
全身满是他们的血 around the corner covered in their blood.
他自首了 He surrendered.
他说他越狱的唯一原因 Said the only reason he broke out
就是要毁了我的人生 was to destroy my life.
一年过去了...

他还在种那些花 and he was still working those plots.
他们就这么让他种花 They just let him work those plots
沿着路种到85号公路 by the roads out by 85,
种菊花 勿忘我 grow chrysanthemums, forget

我搭那个牢房 一心一意想着 I built that cell with the full intention
把Crighton Dallas Wilton抓进来 of bringing Crighton Dallas Wilton here,
扔到栅栏后面 看着他活活饿死 putting him behind those bars and watching him starve to death.
你那样做了吗?

我已经开始相信 I have come to believe
每个生命都很珍贵 that all life is precious.
哪怕是那样的人?

哪怕他那样对你?

哪怕他杀害你全家?

我已经开始相信 I have come to believe
每个生命都很珍贵 that all life is precious.
所以我们吃燕麦汉堡 That's why we're having oatmeal burgers.
你挺擅长的 You're good at it.
重导 Redirecting.
我们需要更多车 We need more gear.
防水布 撬棍 Tarp, crowbar.
我想我们可以去海上那个岛试试 I'm thinking we could try for the islands off the coast.
我觉得会有人去那 I think people could have gone there.
至少 最差还能看看海滩 Hell, at the very least, we could see the beach.
怎么了?

我知道在哪可以找到那些东西 I know where we can find all that.
清除
你只有一个
你失去了谁?

我的妻子和儿子 My wife and son.
你失去了谁 Who you lost.
他们的名字 Their names.
Jenny和Duane Jenny and Duane.
很抱歉 I'm sorry.
永远别说抱歉 Don't ever be sorry.
套路 现在就练 Forms, right now.
不该在这里 Not here.
就现在 Right now.
你还会有孩子的 You're gonna hold a baby again.
都交给你了 It's all yours.
妈的 让开!

噢!

我说过别在这练 I said not here.
那不是你该做的事 That wasn't for you to do.
你怎么能那么做?

你不该就这么...

你不该就这么插一脚!

告诉我这算什么 Tell me how it is.
告诉我这算什么!

我们回去吧 Let's go home.
我哪儿也不去 I'm not going anywhere.
你要回去 You're coming back.
你不用再沉迷过往了 You are done with this.
你已经走出去了 You made it out.
你已经走出去了 You made it out.
噢!

杀了我吧 Kill me.
杀了我!

我说过别在这里 I said not here.
问题就在这里 Morgan Well, that's the thing, Morgan.
此处 亦非此处 Here's not here.
无意义的行为
谢谢你 Thank you.
哦 她逃出来了 Oh, she got out.
她发现那扇门也是开着的 She figured out the door was open, too.
我没有发现 I didn't figure it out.
是你告诉我的 You had to tell me.
很高兴你回来了 Glad you're back.
给你 Here.
在你倒下之前 坐下来好好看看吧 Come on, you sit down before you fall down.
就像我之前说的 他们...

让他在85号公路旁种花 let him work the plots beside 85.
就算他做出了那样的事情 Even after what he did.
他们放任他 因为他那该死的魅力 They let him because he was so damn charming.
我摸清了他的规律 然后静静等待 I found out the schedule, waited,
确保来干事的是对的人 made sure the right people were working.
我快速地抓他上车 I got him in my car quick
然后把他带回了这里 and brought him back here.
如果他们当初抓住了我 就好了 If they'd have caught me, it'd have been fine.
比现在好 It'd have been better.
但是我抓他到了这里 而他们也毫无头绪 But I got him here and they didn't know where to look.
你应该坐下来歇歇 You gotta sit down.
好吧 All right.
我没事 I'm okay.
我把他关在那个牢笼里...

然后让他活活饿死 and I let him starve to death.
花了47天 It took 47 days.
后来我离开了那里 And then I was gone.
我陷入了你之前的境地 I was where you were.
我也是再也不想推开那扇门 And I wasn't trying to open up the door anymore either.
我对他做的事 What I did to him,
没有给予我和平 it didn't give me any peace.
我找到了内心的和平 I found my peace
是在我决定不再杀戮之后 when I decided to never kill again.
不再杀死任何的东西 To never kill anything again.
我决定要让一切结束 When I decided to settle things,
我回到亚特兰大自首 I went back to Atlanta to turn myself in.
结果发现这个世界快要灭亡了 That's how I found out the world ended.
但这世界还没有灭亡 But the world hasn't ended.
有进步 Progress.
我女儿在家里楼梯墙壁上画了这幅图 My daughter drew this on the hallway wall of our house.
她觉得我一定会很生气 She thought I'd get mad.
我只是用画框把它裱起来了 I just put a frame around it.
我回去之后 发现已经没法自首了 After I went back, when I found out I couldn't turn myself in
因为找不到可以向谁自首 because there was no one to turn myself in to,
我回到家里把这个从墙上切了下来 I went back home to cut this from the wall.
在回来的路上我的车报废了 I lost the car on the way back.
我从行尸中穿行了30英里 I walked through 30 miles of the dead
就是为了这一小幅画 for a piece of drywall.
我做过最惊险的事 Scariest thing I ever did.
也是我做过最值得的事 Best thing I ever did.
你可以留在这里 You can stay here.
这里有足够的食物 水电 庇护 You have enough food, power, security.
你可以待在这里度过余生 For the rest of your life, you could stay here.
但你不应该留在这里 But you shouldn't stay here.
我从没想过会迎来像你这样杰出的客人 Can't expect such a splendid guest as yourself to show up.
你留下来就是孤独一人 You stay here, you'll be alone.
你已经孤独太久 You were alone.
有人才有希望 Everything is about people.
人生中的一切都有其价值 Everything in this life that's worth a damn.
世上不会只有我 也不会只有你 It couldn't be just me.

妈的 Tabitha已经走了 Hell, Tabitha's gone now.
我也准备上路了 I'm ready.
在外面的盒子里有一把枪 I have a gun in the lockbox out there.
我扶你 Here.
等等 等等 等等 Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
希望它也能保佑你 Hope it's lucky for you, too,
无论你决定如何 whatever you decide.
我已经决定好了 I've decided.
所有人的避难所 共同的社区 到达即能活命
就是这样 And that's it.
毫无保留 Every last bit.
你觉得这法子对我也有用吗?

是的 Yes.
我觉得有用 I think it can.
也许吧 Maybe.
你没发现我有点颤抖吗?

还有点冒汗 Sweating a little?
天呐 Oh, man.
我在找到的那些照片上看到 I saw how settled this place was
这地方是如此完备 in the pictures I found.
我觉得这里可能有些东西 I thought maybe there'd be something here.
有药可以处理伤口 Medicine to help this.
但那是在你们胜利之前 But that was before you people won.
所以我知道我可能快死了 So I know I'm probably going to die.
但要是我没死...

我将不得不杀了你 Morgan I am going to have to kill you, Morgan.
我将不得不杀光这里所有人 I'm going to have to kill every person here.
一个都不留 包括那些小孩 Every one of them.

就像你那个叫Eastman的朋友的孩子一样 Just like your friend Eastman's children.
那就是规则 Those are the rules.
那是我的行事规范 That's my code.
我想说我很抱歉 I'd say I'm sorry,
但是你不是说过吗?

永远别说抱歉 Don't ever be sorry.
把门打开!

快把门打开!
