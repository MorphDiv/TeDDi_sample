AMC台"行尸走肉" 前情提要...

Pete是外科医生 Pete's a surgeon.
他虐待自己的妻子 He's beating his wife.
我们得阻止他 We have to stop it.
走开!

他杀了Reg 我们只能这么做 He killed Reg, we didn't have a choice.
Rick啊 Rick?
动手吧 Do it.
我要说的计划...

如果有东西引它们 它们就会一起跟着来 They'll follow a path if something's drawing them.
路开了!

我们得现在就行动!

你先回去 告诉大家现在的情况 Head back, tell everyone what's happening.
感觉像喇叭声 It's a horn or something,
这声音把一半行尸从路上引开了 it's pulling the back half off the road.
- 听上去像是从...

上面说点火开关保险丝 It says the ignition switch fuse
就在27号位置上 is found at location number 27.
27号 那是哪里啊 All right, 27.

呃 在这里 Um, right here.
好吧 这一根已经被烧断了 Yeah, okay, this one's blown.
这根红的是什么?

爸 妈 我们要赶紧走了 Mom, Dad, we got to go.
- 快 快点

只要找到一根保险丝 就能发动车子了 Just need to find a fuse so we can start the car.
快成功了 宝贝 6号位置 Almost got it, honey.

那是转弯灯和刹车灯 That's turn signal lamps and stop lamps.
好吧 我们可以不用转弯灯 All right, we can live without turn signals.
爸爸 它们来...

行尸走肉 第六季第2集
西芹汤 Celery soup.
从一开始就放在那了 It's been here since the start.
你真勇敢 You're very brave.
我希望辣椒粉能盖过 Well, I'm hoping the paprika will mask
汤的芹菜味儿 the soup's celeryness.
那到时就会变成 Then you'd be stuck with something
全是辣椒味 that tastes like paprika.
别 谢谢你 No, thank you.
我只是觉得既然主要食材不多了 Well, I just figured since we're running low on staples,
可以试试一些大家平时不用的 I'd try to use a few things nobody seems to want.
我曾经为了清空橱柜 I used to make Ed these spring cleaning casseroles
给Ed做了个春季食物大乱炖 just to empty the pantry.
我还用荸荠创造过奇迹 I made some miracles happen with water chestnuts.
说到奇迹 那道可乐罐头火腿...

真是 Mmm.
Peletier小姐 你才是真正的英雄 Ms.

Shelly 怎么了?

只是看到这些旧式面条有点伤感 It's just those old noodles.
老实讲 如果有人 I mean, I tell you, if someone
能帮我找到面条机 would just find me one of those machines,
托斯卡纳:

我绝对会让你们来场托斯卡纳美食之旅 I swear we would all be eating like we were on a tour of Tuscany.
Shel 你知道吗 我可以教你 You know, Shel, I could teach you
怎么手工做面条 how to make pasta with your own two hands.
但你得保证别在屋里抽烟了 But you'd have to promise not to smoke in the house.
这是个坏习惯 It's just a disgusting habit.
还会要了你的命 And it kills you.
要我说的话 外面要人命的东西 If you ask me, there are too many things
已经够多了 对吗?

对 Right.
你爸过去常打你 后来他把命搞丢了 Your dad used to hit you and then he got himself killed.
都是以前的事 现在都过去了 It happened.

你要么接受这个事实 要么被它吞噬 You live with it or it eats you up.
回家吧 Go home.
Ron啊 Ron.
Ron啊 Ron.
你能下来一下吗?

我不要 No.
- Ron

看 我刚给自己剪完 Look, I just gave myself one.
好吗?

你别让我下个礼拜又准备一次 Don't make me do it again next week.
把帽子脱了 Take off your hat.
- 这都是借口

你只是想找机会跟我谈话 This is just you trying to talk to me.
我们确实有很多话要谈 There are things we need to talk about.
你有很多事要学 There are things that you need to learn.
怎么 你说真的吗?

你干嘛?

你真的怪我吗?

把你左手举过头顶 Raise your left arm above your head.
你做不到 告诉我为什么 You can't.

不想说 No.
你爸是个危险人物 Your father was dangerous.
Rick才是 Rick is dangerous.
他跟这件事没关系 He doesn't have anything to do with this.
怎么 他是你朋友吗?

对啊 他是我朋友 Yeah, he's my friend.
我们还要立起来些铁板 We got some panels to put up,
但是庄稼可以先种起来了 but we don't have to wait to start growing things.
种完地会腰酸背痛 There will be some sore backs and tired feet.
那样才体现出一天的辛苦劳作呢 That's how you know you've put in a hard day's work.
他们在几英里外一个苗圃里发现了几箱种子 They found crates of these at a nursery just a few miles out.
番茄 胡萝卜 想要什么有什么 Tomatoes, carrots, you name it.
我们可以在这里种蔬菜 We can plant them right here.
只要把扩建弄好就可以了 Just need to finish the expansion
围墙也需要加高 and the wall needs to go up.
Reg希望这个社区能延续发展 Reg wanted this community to grow.
你也这么希望 You did, too.
你改主意了吗?

因为有你 大家才能在这生存 Everyone that's here is here because of you.
你得让大家看到 你还在这儿 You need to show them you're still here.
简直暴殄天物 It hams my biscuits is all.
一点一点地扩建 而要改建的最大建筑 And going by cubic feet, the biggest building in the expansion
居然是一座教堂 and we're gonna waste it on a church.
把里面的长椅拿走 就可以成为一个实验室 Take out the benches, that could be a lab,
一个车间 再差也改成游戏房吧 a machine shop, very least a sweet

四面有墙的房产弥足珍贵 Walled

出家人就应该四大皆空 Thumpers just shouldn't get dibs.
也许我们可以共用那个教堂啊 Well, maybe we share the church, you know?
不同的日子用作不同的用途 Do all that stuff on different days.
暴殄天物?

暴殄天物 我只听到这句 Hams my biscuits.

之后说了什么我都没听进去 I mean, I have no idea what you said after that.
- 一点一点地扩建...

你没事吧 Dana?

- 我叫Denise

我很好 I'm okay.
现在我是新上任的医生了 I'm the new doctor now.
你们拿那个阿司匹林做什么?

- 你是医生?

抱歉 呃 我...

听到那个故事了 heard that story.
很好 Fair play.
听我说 我现在有些紧张 Listen, I'm a little nervous here.
我是个心理医生 I'm a psychiatrist.
我上过医学院 I went to med school.
差一点就成为了外科医师 I was even gonna be a surgeon,
但自从我恐慌症发作了几次后 but after the panic attacks,
就对心理学产生了浓厚兴趣 I got really interested in psychology.
还有...

看来我是真想降低大家对我的期望 I think I'm really trying to lower expectations here.
你能行吗?

闭嘴 Eugene 她可以的 Eugene, shut up.

这镇里只有我能上了 I'm all this town's got.
以前Pete不想让我来这 Pete didn't want me here.
但现在我还是来了 But I'm here now
只不过有点想吐罢了 and I only kind of want to throw up.
所以你拿阿司匹林做什么?

呃 我和Eugene Oh, Eugene and I were
正在平台上建守卫塔 working on a platform for another guard tower.
我有点晕 呃 我头还痛着呢 I got a little dizzy.

坐下 我来看看 Sit down, I'll take a look.
你是我第一个病人 You're my first patient.
从症状来看 肯定出不了医疗事故 And with that symptom, I'm pretty sure I can't kill you.
我觉得不一定 要是你漏看 I mean, it is possible if you miss,
比如血肿什么的 like, a hematoma or something.
Carl啊 Carl?
怎么了?

你听到我怎么跟Deanna说你们这群人的 You heard what I told Deanna about your group.
你想做什么?

是我自己的问题 It was about me,
不是你或你们的问题 not you or your group.
我现在明白了 I know that now.
我想帮忙 I want to help.
在教堂里的时候 你本打算教我 You tried to teach me back at my church.
而我现在准备好去学了 But I'm ready to learn now.
我觉得你该把这话昭告天下 I think you need to tell everybody.
是 你说得对 Yeah, I think you're right.
3点左右过来 Come by around 3:

我们先从砍刀开始学 We'll start with the machete.
不!

Richards 你那怎么了?

然后我是来道别的 And I wanted to say good

好吧 看着点后门 有人过来了就告诉我 Okay, watch the back door.

- 我不会留在这

坐下 你得帮我保护Judith Sit down.

他们要是进来就糟了 They're not getting inside this house.
一定不让他们进来 We're not gonna let them.
你看到他们了吗?

他们就是些普通人 They're just people.
这地方太大了 不好保护 This place is too big to protect.
盲区实在太多 There are too many blind spots.
这就是我们为什么能...

他们是翻过了墙 但马上就会死 They got in the walls, but they're gonna die.
全都得死 All of them.
别跟我说再见 Don't tell me good

好吧 Okay.
我不说 I won't.
不 求你了 别这样 No, please.

Denise 我也得过去 Denise, I'm gonna have to go, too.

你头晕得像摆锤一样 You got dizzy swinging a hammer.
总得有人来保护这里吧 Somebody's got to guard this place.
- 你可以的

我也觉得我应该 I also believe my services
留在这里帮忙比较好 would be best rendered right very here.
- 什么?

闭嘴!

究竟怎么了?

有人 一群人 翻墙闯进来了 Someone, a group, they got inside the walls.

我们得进去看看 We need to get in there.

藏起来吧 Hide.
你想要来快的...

离开这里 Leave.
请 Please.
看来是来慢的了 Gonna be slow.
我本来可以阻止他的 I could have stopped him.
- 其他人回来了吗?

- 大家在引行尸走

别无选择 We had to.
- 这些人没有枪

- 如果他们有枪 早就开枪了

我们要比他们先到武器库 We have to get to the armory before they do.
如果我们继续战斗 还可能有救 If we keep moving, this might work.
你不需要杀了他们 You don't have to kill people.
- 我当然要杀

你不会喜欢杀人的 You don't like it.
我要去武器库 需要你的帮助 I'm gonna get to the armory and I need your help.
妈妈!

感谢上帝 Thank God.
感谢上帝 Thank God.
我们得进去 We need to get inside.
我不能进去 我没有枪 I can't go in there.

我不知道怎么战斗 I don't know how to fight.
如果我去了 也只是 If I go inside, I'll just
成为又一个待救的弱者 be another person who's got to be saved.
我能帮的最大的忙 Best thing that I can do for everyone in there
就是待在外面 is to stay out here.

她怎么了?

她在内出血 She's bleeding internally.
有可能伤到了股动脉 Probably severed her femoral artery.
她要死了 She's dying.
好吧 股动脉割伤 能缝合吗?

需要外科医生 Maybe by a surgeon.
你本来要当外科医生的 You were gonna be a surgeon.
但我不是 But I'm not.
她保护了这地方 She was protecting this place.
她保护了大家 这也是我们存在的意义 为了彼此 She was guarding us.

你畏缩了?

我不管 救救她 I don't care.

试一试!

你不会想当懦夫的 You don't want to be a coward.

你是怎么学会那招的?

和一个做芝士的人学的 From a cheese maker.
我们在给你们解脱 We're freeing you.
你们被困住了 You're trapped.
你们要知道 人类不再属于这个世界 You need to know, people don't belong here anymore.
