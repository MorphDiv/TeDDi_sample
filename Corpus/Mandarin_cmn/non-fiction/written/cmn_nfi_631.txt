半场结束时 流泪道歉 and tearful apologies by halftime.
我想我就留在这里吧 I think I'm just gonna stay put
为聚餐准备一些甜菜 and whip up a batch of my chards for the potluck.
甜菜 是说蔬菜么 Chards

对 Yeah.
我们Brody家把它当做开胃菜 Brody clan serves them as an appetizer.
在这里 它们是主菜的一部分 Well, down here they're part of the main course.
多谢 Thank you.
而且 我才是"蔬菜男" And I'm the greens guy.
你听起来好像很害怕 You sound intimidated.
担心有竞争者么 Worried about a little competition?
King King,
跟她说说我的甘蓝菜 tell her about my collards.
众人皆知 Talk of the town.
如果它们真这么特别 Well, if they're so special,
不如咱们打个赌啊 why don't you put a little green on your greens?
-噢 是说"蔬菜大比拼"么

比就比谁怕谁 Oh, it's on like Donkey Kong.
今年聚餐多少人 六个 So what's the number for dinner this year, six?
不 是七个 No, seven.
Laurel打电话来 Laurel called.
她要带来一个名叫Orion的男孩 She's bringing home some boy named Orion.
代表猎户座单词的那个Orion么 Orion like the constellation?
还是金属乐队唱的那首歌《Orion》 Or Metallica song?
可怜的Laurel 上帝保佑她并不是真的喜欢这位 Poor Laurel.

工作吧 Work.
跟他们说说那个盗贼的情况 Fill them in on our burglar.
由于是从高处跌落 我们发现多处伤口 We have multiple injuries due to the height of the fall,
不过死因应该是颈椎骨折 but the cause of death is likely cervical fractures.
C1和C2两处脱臼 Got two dislocations at C1 and C2.
在某个交通路口 新奥尔良警方叫他靠边停车 NOPD tried to pull him over on a random traffic stop.
他仓皇逃窜 He led them on a wild

企图带着被盗物品逃走 hoping to get away with that stolen loot.
你干嘛这样看我们 Why you looking at us like that?
在等第一个问题 Waiting for the first question.
-海军还是陆战队的

他抢劫暴打了某个海军么 He murk some seaman when he robbed him?
没有 死者和军队没有直接关联 Nope, no direct military connection to our dead man.
那我们来干嘛 Then why are we here?
那把被盗的枪 That stolen gun
是海军配发的 is Navy

所以我们要找到失主 归还枪支 So we find the owner and return it.
新奥尔良警方正在 NOPD is cross

将抢劫案与被盗物品进行比对 robbery calls with the stolen loot
以此来锁定位置 to lock down a location.
序列号被擦除了 Filed off the serial number.
我们得把这个交给Sebastian We'll have to get it to Sebastian,
看他能找到什么 see what he can give us.
我在想 今年的聚餐 I'm thinking about shaking things up
我要改变一下 this year at the potluck,
也许不做棉花糖果冻 maybe move away from my marshmallow Jell

和木瓜

当然 是在你同意的前提下 So long as you approve, of course.
你如果不主动提出改变 I was gonna suggest it
我也会建议你改的 if you didn't make the change voluntarily.
真的么 Really?
我知道上次剩了很多 I knew there were a lot of leftovers.
我以为大家是嫌麩质和热量太高 I just thought it was sort of a gluten, caloric,
"好东西太多吃不完了"这样子呢 too

更像是...

"嫌弃木瓜

所以有很多方法可以恢复 So there are several techniques that can be used
被擦除的序列号 to re

有化学侵蚀方法 这是最常见的 There's chemical etching, which is the most common,
通过把蚀刻溶液 going back to metallurgical examinations
涂抹在金属截面上 in which etching solutions
来进行冶金分析 were applied to cross sections of metal.
还有加热法 Then there's heating, which creates
制造出肉眼可辨的 a visible difference between the damaged
-材质受损与完好部分的区别...

今天呢 Today?
Sebastian Sebastian,
这是我从盗贼裤子上刮下来的粉末 here's the powder I pulled from the burglar's pants.
你能否做一下分析 I was wondering if you could do an analysis.
当然 另一方面 Sure.

我决定使用磁化微粒 decided to magnetize the gun and bombard it
来轰击这把枪 with fine magnetized particles.
擦除序列号时 会产生许多缝隙 The particles fill in the gaps that are left
磁化粒子会填满这些缝隙 from indentations when someone files them off.
这样序列号就恢复了 Which allowed me to recover the serial number,
我在海军数据库里搜索 run it through the Navy's database,
然后 bing

被盗的史密斯威森手枪 your stolen Smith Wesson
属于Jacob Tarlow军士长 belongs to Chief Petty Officer Jacob Tarlow.
你能找到地址么 Can you get me an address?
嗯 Yeah.
呃 Uh...
这就困难了 that's gonna be hard,
Jacob在40年前就被谋杀了 since Jacob was murdered 40 years ago.
这个案子 This case...

十分相似 the movie Mississippi Burning.
Jacob Tarlow Jacob Tarlow,
犹太海军军官 Jewish naval officer
招募了黑人新兵 who enlisted black recruits.
他们因此对他处以私刑 They lynched him for it.
等等 这不是你的...

对 我的"枕边故事"之一 Yes, my bedside file stack.
这就是案件原型 This is the original.
打断一下 I

你有"枕边故事" There's a

就是"Wade文件夹" The Wade Files.
你还没告诉他么 You haven't told him?
没 我不想 No, I didn't want to burden young
把这个癖好告诉年轻的Sebastian Sebastian with that particular obsession,
但我的确有一堆文件 but I have a stack of files,
很多悬案 unsolved cases,
在睡不着的夜晚 我就看看 that are my reading material on the nights I can't sleep.
她"很多个"睡不着的夜晚 The many nights she can't sleep.
Jacob Tarlow这个案子 This case, Jacob Tarlow,
是最初的"枕边读物"之一 was the first of those files.
当时我还是法医办公室里 I was a powerless college intern
一位无权无势的实习生 in the coroner's office.
验尸官根本没有看Jacob的尸体 The coroner didn't even bother to look at Jacob's body.
就断定他死于自杀 He ruled his death a suicide.
新奥尔良警方结案了 NOPD closed the case.
等等 如果他是上吊死的 But wait, if he was hung,
谋杀案里怎么会出现一把枪 how does a gun figure into the murder?
在被处决前 他带着这把枪 He had it on him before he was executed.
而且我们一直怀疑 And it's always been speculated
谋杀他的凶手...

偷走了这把枪 Stole his gun.
那把枪一直没有被发现 The gun was never recovered.
案子不了了之 Case went cold.
现在枪支又露面了 Now that it's resurfaced...
也许我们终于能解决一宗40年前的悬案了 ...maybe we could finally solve a 40

气色不错 Looking good.
你真不会说谎 You're a horrible liar.
肝癌 Liver cancer.
人生若是一场马拉松 If life's a marathon,
我算是快到终点了 I'm basically at the finish line.
不过 Still,
这是一段美妙的旅程 it's been a good run.
Jacob去世时 我和Hannah相识 Hannah and I met at the time of Jacob's death.
那时Miriam才一个月大 And Miriam was about a month old.
在现在这股"同性结婚"的风潮前 Mm

我就有两个妈妈了 before it was, uh, all the rage.
一见到她 我就喜欢上她了 Liked this one the moment I saw her face.
就算正在悲痛 Even with the sadness
我19岁就成了寡妇 of becoming a widow at 19,
我也知道Loretta Wade I knew Loretta Wade
是个值得牢牢抓住的好姑娘 was a keeper.

我给你拿点水 I'll get you some water.
这么说 So,
你找到Jacob的枪了 you, um, you found Jacob's gun.

你以前说过 Jacob遇害那天晚上 You said in the past that Jacob had his gun
他带着枪 是么 the night he was murdered?
我看见他走时带着枪 I saw it with him when he left the house.
他确信会遇到阻挠 He was pretty sure he'd meet up with resistance.
他在招兵处也带着枪么 And he had it with him at the recruitment site?
我们在那儿没待多久 We weren't there long
就受到了同盟帮的突袭 before the Confederate Brigade jumped us.
一片混乱 It was chaos.
我和Jacob每个人 Jacob and I were fighting off four,
对抗四五个帮派的人 five of those guys each.
警察的确来了 但没起多大作用 Cops did show up, but they weren't much help.
不知怎么 我和Jacob走散了 Somehow, Jacob and I got separated.
我设法回到车上 I managed to make it back to my car.
一路猛冲回来 I just rushed right over here
想确保他也安全到家了 to make sure that he got back safely.
但Jacob一直没能回来 But Jacob never made it home.
那天晚些时候 警察打电话来 Later that night, uh, we got a call from the police,
告诉我们 Jacob死了 informing us that Jacob was dead.
我们去认领Jacob的尸体时 When we went to claim Jacob's body,
这把枪 他的枪 this gun, his gun,
不在枪套里 was missing from the holster.
我们想要重新调查这起案件 We'd like to reopen the case.
我们需要重新检查 We would need to reexamine
所有证据 all of the evidence.
包括...

Jacob的遗体 Jacob's body.
先进的DNA技术 With the advancements in DNA technology,

来 我扶你 Here, I'll help you.
你要找到杀害我丈夫的人 You find who killed my husband.
Jacob Tarlow的枪 Jacob Tarlow's gun.
知道盗贼从哪儿偷的么 We know where the burglar stole it from?
不知道 Nope.
我们查到 这些被盗物品来自傍水镇 We tracked the stolen items back to the Bywater.
所以我和Brody上门走访 So Brody and I went knocking on doors.
他们认领了大部分被盗物品 People laid claim to most of the stolen loot,
但没人认领Jacob的枪 but no takers on Jacob's gun.
真的要说"被盗物品"么 You really going with "loot"?
那你喜欢哪个词 Well, what do you prefer?

轰炸黑人教会 犹太教堂 Black church and synagogue bombings,
种族暴乱 无恶不作 race riots, you name it.
Loretta把Jacob的海军日志发来了 Loretta sent over Jacob's Navy journal.
看来在他死前 那个帮派曾多次袭击他 It looks like the Brigade attacked him several times prior to his death.
我们得找到这个帮派的成员 We need to put faces with this group.
我用FBI数据库查查同盟帮 I'll run the Confederate Brigade with the FBI database.
看能不能查到帮里的成员 See if we can get a pop on its members.
我是Lasalle Lasalle here.
说吧 Speak.
1972年 1972 seems...
基本已经没有私刑了 late for a lynching.

像Clint Eastwood一样盯着他们么 Give them the Clint Eastwood stare
美国老牌演员 目光深邃严肃
当年我和你妈妈约会时 that your grandfather gave me
你外公就那么盯着我来着 when I started dating your mother?
你就...

做个正常的"老爸"好不 be a dad, you know?
有点疏远 有点冷漠 A little aloof, a little standoffish.
如果你想假装 你对我保护欲过强 And if you want to pretend like you're being overprotective,
也可以 that's fine, too.
就是...

也别搞那套"兄弟情深"了 And...

不搞"兄弟情深"了 No bromance.
谢谢 Thank you.
这个案子 就是我永久搬回新奥尔良来的原因 This case is the reason I moved back to New Orleans permanently.

是我的意大利甘蓝菜 Oh, my Italian kale.
等等 Wait.

对 Loretta跟我说了"蔬菜大比拼" Yeah.

自从我最近发现 Since I recently discovered
我的水果蛋糕不受欢迎以后 that my fruitcake was not well received,
我觉得我也要加入大比拼 I thought I'd get in on the action.
因为她就是裁判 Since she's the judge,
我决定根据她喜欢的香料 I decided to make an algorithm
做一个算法出来 based on all of her favorite spices.
噢天呐 这下完全失控了 Oh, man.

那也是为你的甘蓝菜准备的么 Is that for your kale, too?
不 那其实是与案件相关的 No, that's, uh...

你是说 人在窒息时会拼命反抗 You mean when someone struggles as they're being choked?

Jacob的脊椎并没有骨折 Jacob lacked fractures along the vertebrae,
说明他的身体当时处于放松状态 which means his body was relaxed.
就好比一个酩酊大醉的司机 It's like a

在晕过去后可以避免受伤 after passing out at the wheel.
Jacob当时并非清醒状态吗 Jacob wasn't conscious?
我相信他在被吊起来之前就死了 I believe he was dead before he was hung,

我在追查真相中获得多少快感 how high I get from tracking down the truth?
谢谢你 Dwayne.

等我把Tom Hamilton和那把枪联系在一起 再谢我吧 Thank me when I tie Tom Hamilton to the gun.
由于Loretta的发现 Because of Loretta's discovery,

你应该对此表示尊重 You should respect that.
毕竟 After all,
如果你父亲Cassius当初反抗得更厉害些 if your father Cassius had fought a little harder,
他就不会蹲牢房了 he wouldn't be sharing an 11

去拿你的授权 等你回来以后 So, go get your warrant, and when you come back,
