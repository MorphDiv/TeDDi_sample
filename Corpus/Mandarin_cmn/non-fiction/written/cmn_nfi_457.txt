现在我们知道他是谁 只是不知道他在哪儿 Now, we know who he is;

这网站有个留言板 是吧 The site has a message board, right?
我们就用这个 Let's use it.
没错 我们创建一个身份 假扮成感兴趣的组织 Yeah, we build a cover, pose as an interested group.
和Hobart安排会面 把他拿下 We set up the meet with Hobart, and then we nail him.
这个身份背景必须要引起Hobart的注意 Your cover background has to catch Hobart's attention.

一向如此 Always.
什么结论 Ducky What's the verdict, Ducky?
瞬间死亡 Death was instantaneous.
子弹在撞击后破碎了 Bullet fragmented on impact.
对手无寸铁的人背后开枪 真是懦弱的行为 Shooting someone unarmed in the back is such a cowardly act.

我想我们可以把他排除在外 I think we can safely rule him out.
还有别的吗 Anything else?
是的 有个奇怪的事情 Indeed, something curious.
受害者的眶颧部 Our victim suffered

好吧 Okay.
不如你先告诉我 Why don't you start by telling me
NCIS来干什么吧 what the hell NCIS is doing here.
我们是来逮捕一名恐怖分子的 We're here taking down a terrorist.
你们又来干什么 What the hell are you doing here?
我就是你们的"恐怖分子" I'm your terrorist.
他不是Dorian Hobart So, that's not Dorian Hobart.
他是特别探员Marston 我们的诱饵 That is Special Agent Marston, our decoy.

那是他的专长 死者是谁 That's his wheelhouse.

Valerie Barnes 是Hobart网站暗杀名单上 Valerie Barnes, wife of a Navy SEAL
一位海豹突击队员的妻子 listed on his Web site.
她昨晚被杀了 She was killed last night.
我很遗憾 Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
但Hobart不是你们要找的人 But Hobart can't be your guy.
我们两个月前将他逮捕 We captured him two months ago.
但一直没有泄露他被捕的消息 We kept the arrest under wraps
以便维持他的网络身份 in order to maintain his online presence.
调查任何潜在威胁 Checked out any potential threats.
为什么不把Barnes中校从暗杀名单上删除呢 Why didn't you remove Commander Barnes from the hit list?
我们得保持网站的真实性 Well, we had to maintain the site's authenticity.
如果有任何迹象表明 If there was any indication that
他或他的家人处于危险之中 我们就会介入 he or his family were in danger, we would have stepped in.

我会大大方方承认 to admit when I've made a mistake,
前提是我真的"犯了错误" but only when I've made one.
死者被点38口径的子弹射中 Our victim was shot with a .

近距离射击 只开一枪 在她家里 Close range, single round, at her residence.
这说明什么 特别探员Keates What does that tell you, Special Agent Keates?
说明不是极端组织下的手 It means it wasn't done by an extremist group.
恐怖分子都喜欢把事情闹大 Terrorists have a flair for drama.
他们不是为了杀人 而是要传达信息 It's not just about killing;

你这起谋杀案太低调了 Look, your murder's too quiet.
我觉得你调查的方向错了 I think you're going down the wrong path.
我同意 I agree.
我是Gibbs Gibbs.

只不过你要做的 Except you had to do more
可比倒酒擦皮鞋多多了 是吧 than fetch drinks and shine shoes, huh?
我没留下还真是奇怪哈 And it's a wonder I didn't stay.
不奇怪 你更喜欢夹着尾巴逃走 No, you preferred to tuck tail and run.
瞧瞧你 还是那么犀利 Look at you, same old biting wit.
根本没怎么变化哈 Nothing much has changed, huh?
都已完美 何必再改 Why mess with perfection?
Barnes中校在路上了 Commander Barnes is on his way in.
我们走 Let's go.
你这打扮挺不错的 Keates That's a good look on you, Keates.
节哀顺变 Sorry for your loss.
我一直都知道这份工作可能会要我的命 You know, I always knew my job could cost me my life.
我做好了心理准备 I prepared for that.
却没想到会给我的家人带来危险 I never thought it'd put my family in danger.
我们不能确定她是因你而死的 We don't know that it did.
这两者可能毫无关联 The two might not be connected.
等等 你是说 Wait, a

有人特意针对我妻子 purposely targeted my wife?
有可能 Think it's possible.
你知道她和谁有矛盾么 You know anyone she might have had problems with?
不 No.
我不知道 Nobody I'm aware of.
她的举止有变化么 What about changes in her behavior?
变化 我不知道 Changes?

我...

我是个很棒的海豹 却不是个好丈夫 That makes me a damn good SEAL but not the best husband.
也不是个好父亲 Or father.
你一定要抓住凶手 Gibbs探员 You better catch whoever did this, Agent Gibbs.
别让他落在我手里 Find him before I do.
中校 Commander, the only thing
你现在唯一应该关心的就是你女儿 that you should be focusing on is your daughter.
其它一切都交给我们 You let us handle the rest.
你说得对 You're right.
我现在可以见她么 Can I see her now?
当然 Sure.
Abby 你打给我 Abby, you rang?
对 接着 I did.

这是芳香热敷袋 It's an aromatherapy heating pad.
我听说Tony的...

老朋友把你打惨了 blast from the past took you down kind of hard.
怎么啦 她让我如实汇报的 What?

这些假人怎么回事 What's with the dummies?
噢 这是Tony和特别探员Keates Oh, it's Tony and Special Agent Keates.
我在给Abby还原现场 I was setting the scene for Abby.
肢体站位是全球通用的语言 Body position is a universal language.
据我所见来判断 And from what I've been looking at,
这俩人交情不浅 these two have some serious history.
作为在场观众 我可以证明 绝对有火花 Yeah, from a firsthand account, there was a definite spark.
有什么想法 Thoughts?
Tony从没提到过她 Well, Tony never mentioned her before.
不过Bishop说得对 自从那谁以后 But Bishop's right

我没见过他在任何人身边如此表现 act like that around someone since...
什么 What?
一言难尽 It's complicated.
噢 Oh.
嗯 Tony明显很空虚 Well, Tony's clearly trying to fill some void.
也许她正是他所需要的 Maybe she's exactly what he needs.
一个熟悉的人 Someone familiar.
我觉得适当地推他一把 I don't think a nice little push
没什么坏处 in the right direction would hurt.
我加入 I'm in.
McGee你呢 McGee?
如果我赞同 你保证更换话题吗 If I say yes, you promise to change the subject?
-我保证

证物A Exhibit A

我们的小子弹 our lone bullet.
怎么会这样 What happened to it?
弹药老化 It's degraded ammunition.
储存不当就会这样 It happens when it isn't stored properly.
等我把犯罪现场以及受害人身上搜集到的碎片 Once I catalog the pieces from our crime scene
都记录在案 and from our victim,
就可以建立一个子弹的三维模型 I'll be able to make a 3

就像是弹药拼图 Sort of a ballistics jigsaw puzzle.
如果这颗子弹在系统里有匹配记录 And if there's a bullet in the system that matches,
那么我们就离确认枪手 then we'll be closer
更近了一步 to identifying our shooter.
怎能不爱我大科学 Don't you just love science?
我们多久可以回到家里 So, how long till we can go back to the house?
得几天吧 At least a few days.
我们住在Admiral Heights酒店 We'll be staying at the Admiral Heights Hotel.
如果有消息 可以告诉我么 Could you let me know if there's any news?
你确定不想把那个堡垒带走么 You're sure you don't want to take that fort with you?
不用了 No.
有我爸爸在 I have my dad.
我只需要他 That's all I need.
十分感谢你保护她 Can't thank you enough for keeping her safe.
说话算话 Promise is a promise.
老大 我深入调查了下 All right, boss, I did some digging.
在Valerie Barnes的尸检中 The old facial fracture Ducky discovered
Ducky发现的陈旧性面部骨折 during Valerie Barnes' autopsy was the work
正是George Burton的杰作 of none other than George Burton.
-那个连环杀手

不要忘了"狂热食人魔" Don't forget"enthusiastic cannibal."
这家伙犯罪现场的照片 This guy's crime scene photos would make
能让汉尼拔·莱克特都自愧不如 【注：

他们是什么关系 What's the connection?
在1999年 Well, in 1999,
Valerie是马里兰州的司法精神鉴定医师 Valerie worked as a forensic psychiatrist in Maryland,
Burton当时是个在押囚犯 and Burton was an inmate.
他在审前心理评估时突然发狂 He got loose during his pretrial evaluation,
她当时命悬一线 and, well, it was a close call.
George Burton现在在哪儿 Where is George Burton now?
在东部州立精神病院 Serving a life sentence
接受无期徒刑 at Eastern State Psychiatric Hospital.
DiNozzo 你刚刚给了他不在场证明 Well, DiNozzo, you just gave him his alibi.
那次袭击后 Valerie与Burton Well, Valerie cut off all contact with Burton
一直没有任何联系 直到两周前 after the attack until two weeks ago.
医院证实 她去探望过Burton Hospital confirmed she paid him a visit
并进行密谈 behind closed doors.
真是个意外之喜 Well, isn't this a pleasant surprise.
你们是谁啊 And, uh...

我是非常特别的探员Anthony DiNozzo I'm Very Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
我可喜欢意大利人了 I do love Italian.
好吧 Okay.

她怎么死的 How did she die?
我们 We are
说的是Valerie 是吧 talking about Valerie, right?
谁说她死了 Who said she's dead?
省省吧 都写在你们脸上了 Come on, I can see it all over your faces.
你们在想 Uh, you're thinking
我可能和这事有关系 that I probably have something to do with it.
这是个合情合理的假设 Which is an understandable assumption,
但你们忘了我这闪亮夺目的"手链" except for the glaringly obvious.
我们在想 也许你叫某个 What we're thinking is maybe you had one of
精神错乱的笔友替你干了这活儿 your unbalanced pen pals do the job for you.
你太看得起我了 You flatter me.
那一定是我"看"的角度错了 I must have said it wrong.
不 我不会...

我不会伤害Valerie的 I

我并不想杀她 I...

Valerie怎么成为障碍了 How was Valerie an obstacle?

别睡了 No napping.
McGee 我们翻看 McGee, we've been over
Valerie的病人资料 都看好几个小时了 Valerie's patient files for hours
什么都没发现 and haven't found a thing.
我们听信了 We're going on the word

正在跟进一个新的线索 been following up on a new lead.
对 死者是一名精神病医师 Yeah, our victim was a psychiatrist,
所以我们在调查她的病人 so we're looking into her patients.
杀人是为了保守阴暗的秘密 Killing to keep a dark secret.
的确会有人为此痛下杀手 People have done so for less.
我很感兴趣 I'm intrigued.
你们还有什么发现 What else you got?

发现只有六个人 and found only six that had
有任何行为暴力史 any sort of history of violent behavior.
袭击 家庭暴力 精神分裂 Assault, domestic violence, schizophrenia,

我们都很想念她 We all miss her.
我爱Ziva 但她离开我们了 I love Ziva, but she left us.
她已经走了 She is gone.
这很痛苦 And

糟糕透顶 and it sucks,
但这就是现实 你得面对现实 but that's reality and you have to face it.
我已经面对了 I have faced it.
很多 很多次 Many, many times.
她说不要 She said no.
她不想回来了 She didn't want to come back.
就这样 That's that.
这件事我已经放下了 I have moved on from it.
但你还放不下她 But you haven't moved on from her.
你不能暂停自己的生活 And you can't keep putting your life on hold
一直等她出现 因为...

她可能永远不会回来了 she probably never will.
我知道 I know.
但并不能让我好受些 Doesn't make it any easier.

你的柯尔特手枪杀了她 Your Colt did.
弹道吻合 Ballistics are a match.
什么 What?
我好久没见到那把枪了 自从...

相信我 你应该接着说 Trust me, you want to keep talking here.
那是一年之前 It was a year ago.
我刚离开部队 I just left the corps,
很难适应 and I was having trouble adjusting.
我当时情绪非常低落 I was in a really dark place.
枪械走火不是意外 Firearm discharge wasn't an accident.
对 No.
我试图自杀 但枪走火了 I tried to take my own life, but the gun misfired.
然后我去向Valerie寻求帮助 That's when I went to Valerie for help.
她为你治疗 She was treating you?
不 她不能 因为我们是朋友 No, she couldn't, because we were friends,
但她把我介绍给她的一名同事 but she set me up with one of her colleagues.
你的手枪呢 Where's the Colt?
在那次事件后 After the incident,
我觉得不应该把枪放在家里 I didn't trust myself with the gun in the house,
所以Val把枪锁在她丈夫的保险柜里 so Val locked it up in her husband's safe

他们没有住在这儿 They didn't stay here.

他消失了 He's gone.
Barnes中校的信用卡和手机都没有动静 Well, no hits on Commander Barnes' credit cards or phone.
他肯定知道我们在追踪他 He must know we're tracking him.

怎么了 What is it?
医疗记录里的日期 Dates in this hospital report.
都在中校被派遣到海外 They're all from when the commander
执行任务期间 was deployed overseas.
所以凶手并不是施虐者 So, our killer wasn't our abuser.
又一个等你解开的谜团 It's another mystery for you to solve.
像George Burton这样的反社会者 Sociopaths like George Burton,
他们会采取任何极端手段 they will go to any extreme

更不用说 完全没有悔恨 not to mention a total lack of remorse
所以他们的欺骗手段十分高明 that makes them very skillful at deception.
是的 但Valerie知道这些 Yeah, but Valerie knew that,
却没有报警 and she did not go to the police.
她在保护某个跟她很亲近的人 She was protecting someone closer to home.
她丈夫也许犯下了谋杀 但是 Her husband may be guilty of murder, but...
Barnes中校并没有展示出 Commander Barnes doesn't exhibit
任何反社会者的临床症状 any clinical signs of being a sociopath.

不 No.
爹地没看到她都做了什么 Daddy didn't see what she did.
他在的时候 事情总是会好起来 Things were always better when he was around.
所以你才伤害你自己吗 That's why you'd injure yourself?
好让他回来 So he'd come back?
有时候管用 Sometimes it worked.
但他在家的时间总没有我希望的那么长 But he'd never stay as long as I wanted.
除非你妈妈不在了 Unless your mom was gone.
那他就不能离开你了 Then he couldn't leave you.
这是她自己的错 It's her own fault.
她所做的一切 就是让我觉得自己不正常 All she ever did was make me feel broken.
摆脱她是最好的解决方法 Getting rid of her was the best solution.

你需要找到自己的路 You needed to find your own way.
我从未因此怪你 I never faulted you for that.
但我值得更好的 But I deserve better.
你说得太对了 You are absolutely right.
我非常抱歉 And I am very sorry.
都过去了 It's in the past.
我很高兴你找到了追求的目标 I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
尽管这个橙色让人感觉 Although it's not the most soothing
不够安心 但我明白这意思 shade of orange, but I guess I get the appeal.
就是呢 I know.
就像在南瓜里工作 It's like working in a pumpkin.
但这是家 But it's home.
你呢 How about you?
你找到自己的目标了吗 Did you find what you were looking for?
我算是还在努力吧 I'm kind of still a work in progress.
