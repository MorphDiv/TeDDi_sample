您正在收听WNZ频道 You're listening to WNZ.
纽约美好的一天开始了 It's a beautiful day in New York today.
今日气温最高15摄氏度 Temperatures expected to reach the mid

纽约市区16摄氏度 海滩温度达20摄氏度 62 in Greenpoint, 68 at the beaches.
现在 回到...

喂 Finch...

Finch啊?

Ike 过来一下!

怎么了?

是Finch 你看他 It's Finch, look at him.
Finch怎么了?

他没有发烧 He doesn't have a fever,
但是他说他肚子疼 还眼冒金星 but he says his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots.
怎么了 Finch?

嘿 Ike Ike.
是你吗?

我...

摸摸他的手 Feel his hands.
发冷还出汗 They're cold and clammy.
我才不摸他的手 No way I'm feeling his hands.
我们会告诉局里你生病了 We'll tell the office you're sick.
有什么需要 就打电话来 If you need anything, call.
好吗?

叮铃铃 Ringy

他们相信了 They bought it.
难以置信 Incredible.
我这拙劣无比的演技 A wildly substandard performance,
他们居然毫不怀疑 and they never doubted it for an instant.
这么美好的一天我怎么能浪费到工作上去?

要想休完美的一日假 就要吃片自己的NZT To have a truly epic day off, you're gonna want your own NZT.
多谢我在参议院的朋友 Thanks to my friend in the senate,
我拿到了五片属于自己的药 I've got five of my very own pills.
当然 你得把它们藏起来 Of course, you have to keep them hidden.
而藏东西的关键就是 And the key to a good hiding place
藏匿NZT
找个谁都不想看的地儿 is finding a place no one would want to look.
骷髅和裸体的组合品 Something with the right combination
通常都挺有作用 of skeletons and naked people usually does the trick.
一定会有许多人说 可以把药片藏在 Now, a lot of people will say you should stash your pills
买一个骷髅唱片
你本来就有的药罐里 in a prescription bottle that you've already got,
藏在药罐里
但是政府已经开始注意药片了 but the government's thinking pills already,
如果被他们发现 会让你进监狱 and if they look in there, you could wind up in prison.
进监狱
这比上班还要惨 That's worse than work.
还是用唱片封面的主意吧 Stick to your album covers.
如果你想带一片出门 Then if you want to take one with you,
把它塞在这口袋里 you just tuck it right in here.
现在人们都叫它套套口袋 Now, we used to call that the condom pocket.
这行为挺幼稚还挺傻的 That's a little childish and stupid,
但高中也很幼稚很傻 大家还不是照去 but, then again, so was high school.
光阴似箭 日月如梭 Life goes by really fast.
有时候你不驻足观赏 就错失了人生 If you don't stop to look around sometimes, you could miss it.
当然 要是Rebecca和我一起会更好玩 Of course, it'd be a lot more fun if Rebecca could come,
但我不能告诉她 我还有别的渠道拿到NTZ but I can't really tell her that I got my own supply of NZT.
但我还是要找个伴 But, still, I could use the company.
今天我要好好玩 I'm gonna have fun today.
引用约翰·列侬的话说 "一个人的理想只是梦想 I quote John Lennon, "A dream you dream alone is only a dream.
约翰·列侬:

共同的理想才会成为现实" A dream you dream together is reality."
毕竟 他是个海象 After all, he was the walrus.
披头士歌曲 "我是海象"
我也可以当海象 I could be the walrus.
联邦调查局管着这地方的事实不会变 Wouldn't change the fact that the FBI owns this place
而且他们还会盯着我的一举一动 and pretty much watches my every move.
事情不该这样发展的 Oh, that's not how it goes.
我是Dean Merrick Hi.

多谢你抽出时间来见我 Thanks for making the time to see me.
请坐 Please.
能和同伴们坐在一起总是再好不过 It's always nice to sit down with some fellow travelers.
你说你是某个情报机局的?

我们不能说出名字 We're not supposed to say the name,
你们知道原因 但是我们都心知肚明的 you know how it is, but we all know the deal.
就是总部在弗吉尼亚州兰利的 A certain agency with a certain headquarters
那个情报机构 in Langley, Virginia.
即中情局
那为什么弗吉尼亚州的朋友 And why have our friends in Virginia asked
要指名见我们三个呢?

我过来是和你们谈谈Brian Finch的 Came to talk to you about Brian Finch.
你对Brian Finch有什么了解?

很特别的人 Unique asset.
富含着维生素和矿物质 Well

各位 Guys.
咱们是一个团队 应该情报共享 It's one big team, we share information.
我们有人知道那药的事 A few of us know about the pills,
也有人知道Finch a few of us know about Finch.
我从没把Brian Finch的事告诉过中情局 I never told the CIA about Brian Finch.
听着 我这是友好拜访 Look, this is a friendly visit.
我们很支持你们的行动 We support what you're doing.
实际上 我希望我们能互惠互利 In fact, we want to share in the benefits of it.
接下来几天我们要实施一个行动 We're staging an operation next few days.
细节...

但是一切取决于那个重要人物 But it matters to the people who matter.
为了成功 我们想事先做好准备 We want to stack the deck for success.
我们想借你们的人几天 We'd like to borrow your guy for a spell.
你就不能直说吗 Merrick先生 Well, I wish you had led with this request, Mr.

还能给大家省点时间 You could have saved us all some time.
不行 No.
我理解你 真的 I hear you, I do.
但是我能保证 他绝对不会受到一点伤害 But let me assure you, he'll be kept strictly out of harm's way.
我们会监督他吃药 We'll monitor his access to those pills,
还有 高层已经授权这个要求 and I should say this request has been vetted from on high.
这个部门是对Brian Finch负责的 This department is responsible for Brian Finch,
- 我们绝不可能放走他

我懂你的意思 I get it, I do.
我们的人总是先斩后奏 People on my side go over my head all the time.
很高兴见到你 Nice to meet you.
你要知道 Just so you know.
我们的人做事都很在行 My people are very good at what they do.
两天之内你们的小伙子就会来了 You'll have your boy back in no more than two days.
你这不是请求 You're not making a request.
Brian在哪?

非常感激你们的配合 We sincerely appreciate your cooperation.
Brian到底在哪?

喂 Finch Finch.
可以醒醒了 Back to the land of the living.
嘿 Hey.
我在哪?

在很远的一处地方 You're a long way from just about anywhere.
抱歉电击了你...

我本不想那么戏剧化的 I don't like to be theatrical,
但是他们说 不能让你知道你被带到了什么地方 but they said we couldn't tell you where we're taking you.
你们想要怎样?

我们不是要绑架你 We're not kidnapping you.
你是和我们一起工作的 You're working with us.
欢迎参加你的第一个秘密行动 Welcome to your first black op.

翻译:

我来给你解释一下 Let's get on the same page.
他们不告诉我们你的事 They wouldn't tell us much about you.
但是我们确实...

大概情况...

政府方面给你吃了些神经增强药 The government has you on some next

让你特别擅长解决问题 which makes you crazy

我说得对吗?

嘿 老兄 Hey, man.
公寓挺不错啊 Cool apartment.
那是我们的通讯员 That's our comm guy.
我们的翻译不太爱说话 Our translator doesn't speak much,
但是他很在行 but he's damn good at his job.
所以呢 你们是军队的吗?

曾经是 We've been in armies.
你们有名字吗?

有 Yes.
但你还是别知道的好 But it's best that you don't have that information.
假如你最后要出席指证 相信我 If you end up testifying against this thing, trust me,
知道的越少越好 lack of information will be your best friend.
你刚才说"指证"?

我们到底要在这干什么?

解决问题先生 你要来帮助我们 You, Mr.

找到藏在丛林里的这个混蛋 zero in on this nasty guy that's hiding out in these woods.
Aleksey Basayev是谁?

他加入了车臣国的圣战狂热组织 He joined some jihadi

两周前潜入了美国 snuck into the States two weeks ago.
几天前 他逃脱了监视范围 Couple days ago, he slipped surveillance,
现在藏身在这片区域 and he's holed up somewhere out here.
假如他逃过追捕 就会在美国境内杀害他人 If he gets by us, he will kill people on U.

下次出门可以带个箱子 Feel free to carry a box on your next trip.
不 没门 No.

你们电击了我 Look, you tased me.
把我扔在...

那是啥 橡皮艇里?

我凭什么要相信你说的话?

问得好 That's a fair question.
我们拿到了局里允许你外出的证书 Got a permission slip from the Bureau.
也得到命令要把你安全带回家 Also have orders to bring you home okay.
我还拿到了两片这玩意 I've also got two of these.
你的国家需要你来维护安全 Brian Now, your country needs you to help keep it safe, Brian.
你说呢?

今天本该是我放假的日子 Supposed to be my day off.
我们在宾夕法尼亚的某处 We were somewhere in Pennsylvania.
阿勒格尼群岛的荒野上 The Allegheny Islands Wilderness.
从他们给我的卫星地图上 I could tell that much
我只能看出这些来 from the satellite pictures they gave me.
现在无处可去 There's nowhere to go.
我在树林的深处 I'm days from the edge of the woods.
想要出去的最好办法 就是帮他们找到那个人...

找到Aleksey Basayev Aleksey Basayev.
一个动作片英雄 Your basic action hero.
在车臣战争中为俄罗斯而战 Fought for the Russians in the Chechen War.
在高加索山脉度过了一整个冬天 He spent an entire winter in the Caucasus Mountains.
他变成了恐怖分子之后的事 上面就没写了 As far as when he became a terrorist, it didn't say.
战后与一个车臣女人结婚 He married a Chechen woman after the war.
之后 所有信息...

看了这么多遍 禁不住好奇起来 Saw it so many times, I couldn't help but get curious.
不要想太多Basayev做了什么 Don't worry so much about what Basayev did.
你需要想的是他现在在哪 You need to worry about where he is.
我觉得我已经知道他在哪了 I think I know that already.
Basayev是个生存主义者 Basayev is a survivalist.
他需要三样东西存活下来:

还挺有见地的 That's quite an insight.
我看了手头上每一张卫星照片 I looked at every satellite photo we have,
我在丛林里找到了十五处 and I found 15 different places in these woods
易接近的水源 that have easy access to a stream,
居住的山洞 还可以捕猎的地方 caves for shelter, and wildlife to hunt.
这里...

每天在那条河里喝水 that drink from that stream every day.
这是昨天的照片 And here's a photo from yesterday.
我看到过鹿 I see deer.
有多少鹿?

那个鹿群有七头鹿 There were seven deer in that herd.
是在那条河里喝水的同一批鹿 The same group drinks from that stream every day.
但是昨天...

少了一头 One is missing.
说明Basayev在捕猎 Means Basayev is hunting.
就在东北12公里处 12 klicks northeast of here.
干得漂亮 Good job.
我去 伙计 Damn, man.
这些药片里到底是什么?

不 不不不 这不是...

嘿 Hey.
你从中情局的朋友那边了解到情况了吗?

跟我一起在"游骑兵"服役的战友 从沙盒回来之后 Okay, I served with a guy in the Rangers, he went CIA
他就去了中情局 我会找他了解情况 when we got back from the Sandbox...

她气坏了 是吧?

要么就是她的演技很赞 Or she's putting on a good show.
有人签名授权了这项行动 Somebody put a signature down authorizing this,
没有人出面承认 but no one will own up to it.
副局长竟然说"预计"他三天就能回来 The deputy director "hope" he'll be back in three days.
- Brian不是军人

一旦找到了 Once that's done,
我一定要查出是谁授权的 I'm gonna figure out who the hell authorized this,
找出来之后 如果他不辞职 and either that person will no longer work for the Bureau
我就不干 or I won't.
你是不是觉得我早就知情?

Rebecca 我绝对不会让Brian参与军事行动 Rebecca, I would never send Brian on a military mission.
现在 我真的不想这么做 Now, I hate to do what I'm gonna do,
但这是他们逼我的 but they've left me no choice.
这份文件 This is a file
是我们上次和中情局合作时的文件 from the last time we collaborated with the CIA.
我划定了六个名字 I'm circling six names.
他们是谁?

你会知道的 You'll figure it out.
如果我把这张纸交给你 If I pass you this piece of paper,
我们可能都得接受委员会讯问了 we could both wind up in front of a subcommittee.
今天本来是美好的一天 This is supposed to be the perfect day off.
但是我已经走了12英里路 And instead I've walked 12 miles.
自从夏令营之后 我还从来没有在森林里 I haven't spent this much time in a woods
呆过这么长时间 since summer camp.
你吃了这玩意儿?

傻逼 这是美洲商陆 有毒的 These are pokeweed, you idiot.
有个学长说 吃了它会产生幻觉 One of the older kids told me they'd give me hallucinations.
我待在医务室的时候 他们逼着我 They made me copy out a chapter about poisonous plants
手抄了一整章有关有毒植物的文章 by hand while I sat in the nurse's office.
雇佣兵 或是合约兵 管他们叫什么 Mercenaries or contractors or whatever these guys were,
反正他们是坏人 they're terrible company.
哪怕吃了NZT Hours together in the woods,
在林子里游荡了几个小时 and even on NZT, I still don't know
我还是对他们一无所知 anything useful about any of them.
他们不跟我说自己的名字 They wouldn't tell me their names,
所以 我就给他们起了各种外号 so I gave them nicknames to keep track of them.
那个头头 他是Rooney Guy in charge...

九次 Nine times.
这小伙还不错 但是总是受人指挥 它叫Cameron Nice guy, but people tell him what to do...

还有个家伙 从来不说话 The one who never says anything,
他叫Abe Froman that's Abe Froman,
芝加哥腊肠之王 Sausage King of Chicago.
走完一天的路 我脚上长满了水泡 I had blisters all over my feet by the end of the day,
但是直觉告诉我 跟这帮人抱怨 but something tells me that complaining to these guys
没有好下场 would be a bad idea.
那是他的藏身处 That's his spot.
你怎么知道?

看看那只鹿 Look at the deer.
找不到Basayev Don't see Basayev.
他会回来的 He'll be back.
不管怎样 等他睡着了再说 Waiting on him to fall asleep anyway.
Finch 过来 Finch, come here.
你身上的药效还有多久?

没多久了 Not much.
最多个把小时 Couple hours, tops.
等我们准备好的时候 周围会很安静 It's gonna get quiet when we prep.
等我们接近建筑物的时候 我希望你再吃一颗 When we move on that structure, I want you to take it.
联邦调查局一天只让我吃一片 The FBI only gives me one a day.
没错 联邦调查局有很详细的规矩 Yeah, I'm sure the FBI has an extensive list of rules
和规章制度 and regulations.
但是我希望你能保持最佳状态 I want you at your best.
想看看吗?

那些药片 See, those pills,
他们告诉我 为了你的安全考虑 they told us you were the only one
你一天只能吃一颗 who could take them safely.
为什么?

他们会有副作用 They have side effects.
没错 如果一口气吃几颗 Yeah, you take a few of them,
就会有很严重的副作用 and they get really, really bad.
但是出于某种因素 That doesn't happen to me.
我没有副作用 For some reason.
所以联邦调查局的人想知道原因 And the FBI wants to know why.
懂了 Gotcha.
像我这种笨娃娃才不可能跟你一样吃到这种药 Then dumb grunts like me can get souped up like you.
吃完了啥感觉?

智商暴涨?

你要知道 现在跟你说话的人 Understand you're talking to a guy
连候补军校都考不上 who couldn't get into OCS.
兄弟 我曾被被五所学校开除过 Dude, I got kicked out of five schools.
我的父母以前看我 Yeah, my parents used to look at me
就像看个傻子一样 like I was some sort of clown.
我是说 I mean,
挺难解释的 it's complicated.
至于这些药呢?

它们确实很神奇 They're amazing.
你干嘛踢我?

我们发现外面有个前雪域突击队的人在走动 We have an ex

别再唧唧歪歪了 懂吗?

Crossfit上尉!

我得少吃甜甜圈了 I got to stop with the donuts.
- 不!

- 我是Rebecca Harris

Mike 我们现在处在一个很尴尬的局面 Well, we're in a tricky situation, Mike.
中情局的人绑架了我们的人 CIA hijacked one of our assets,
那人名叫Brian Finch a kid named Brian Finch.
我们想知道发生了什么 We need to know what's going on.
然后你来问我?

我们在这里做市场调研的 We do market research here.
没错 像你 还有其他在这个城市 Yeah, well, as you and many of the other people
当警察的人都知道 who carry badges around this city know,
这地方是给中情局挖掘情报用的 this place is a data

那个孩子对我来说很重要 Kid is important to me.
Mike 我们可是一起服过役的 We served together, Mike.
你知道什么就说什么 Anything you can tell us.
老兄 恐怕这个忙我帮不了你 Can't help you, brother.
你这么说 我真的很伤心 Well, I'm sincerely sorry to hear that.
我们圈定了六个名字 I have a list of six names.
中情局在世界各地都潜伏着特工 Clandestine CIA operatives positioned all over the world.
一个小时之内 要是我还不知道Brian的下落 And if I don't know where Brian is in one hour,
我就泄露名单 I'm gonna leak them.
你知不知道 这可是犯罪 会让那些人死...

一个小时的时间 可以救你的人一命 Use that hour to get your men to safety.
还有 如果你想说犯罪的话 我不介意 And if you want to talk crimes, I'll see yours
还有我提醒你 中情局没有权利在美国本土出手 and I'll raise you...

一个小时 不然你的人就彻底完蛋了 One hour or your guys are burned for good.
Boyle的线人告诉我们 Boyle's contact
中情局上周恢复了三名合同兵 told us the CIA put three contractors
现役人员的身份 on active payroll last week.
他们全部都来到了宾夕法尼亚 They all flew into Pennsylvania.
考虑到时间和地点 And based on the time and locale,
我们有理由相信 it's reasonable to assume
这只队伍就是跟Brian合作的队伍 that this is the team that Brian is working with.
John Kellerman是前三角洲成员 John Kellerman is former Delta.
Kyle Hollinger以前是海军陆战队的 Kyle Hollinger was in the Navy.
候补军校考试挂了两次 Failed his OCS test twice.
在海豹突击队几次训练过后 被淘汰了 Washed out of SEAL training a few times.
还有这个家伙 And there's this guy.
Miklos Petrov 他曾经属于波兰军队 Miklos Petrov...

由于在伊拉克的残暴行动 他被解除了职位 but he was discharged after some atrocity in Iraq.
在那之后 他是中情局设立在 After that, he was a lead interrogator
华沙外秘密监狱的询问官 at a CIA black site outside of Warsaw.
然后 这个男的现在和Brian一起执行任务 So, this man is out there with Brian on a mission
而且根本没人监管 that has essentially no oversight.
我那个在中情局的线人对此次行动的 My contact at the CIA didn't know the details
细节并不知道 但是他告诉我 of this mission but told me
之前几次行动的时候 这个秘密 there was another member of this black ops team
行动小组里还有另一个成员 the past few times they headed out.
Carla Paz 她是直升机飞行员 Carla Paz...

现在都是给曼哈顿的富豪开直升机 Ferries rich guys around Manhattan now.
听着 我不管你用什么方式 Look, I don't care how you get her talking.
把她知道的小组信息统统挖出来 Find out everything she knows about that unit.
深夜到了 意味着 Nightfall means
我该吃药了 Rooney和他的战友们 I get another pill and Rooney and his crew
在外行动 make their move.
遇上Basayev了!

目标正在移动!

进去确认一下 Moving in to check it out.
有人受伤了!

有一个队员受伤了!

把他绑起来 Zip

我去看看我的翻译官 I'm gonna check on my translator.
确保还活着 Make sure he's alive.
你干得不错啊 小子 Hey, you handled yourself well, kid.
你要是不想在办公室待着了 跟我们干吧 Let me know if you ever get tired, bored of your desk job.
现在什么情况?

等飞机来救我们?

快了 但是我们得跟他谈一谈 Soon, though, we're gonna talk to him for a while.
你就不能把他关进监狱之后再问吗?

不 老实说 这里的环境更适合我们 No, tactically this is a much better environment
直接进入主题 to get to the straight talk.
你的任务完成了 小子 You did your thing, kid.
抓住了一个大坏蛋 Brought down a really bad guy.
现在的任务交给我们了 Now, let us do our thing.
我还是很想知道 到底这人干了什么 I still want to know what this guy did.
他们似乎并不在意我在周围晃荡 They didn't seem to care too much that I was around.
我觉得联邦调查局的人没有告诉他们 I'm guessing no one told them that the FBI
我曾经在服用完NZT之后 学了俄语 made me study Russian while I was on NZT.
我有点基础了 I had the basics down.
你别无选择
你必须得跟布鲁塞尔的女人上床
我可没有说我俄语很流利哦 I didn't say I was fluent.
但是 他们聊的越多 我知道的也越多 But the more they talked, the more dialed

我不是恐怖分子
你知道我在这干什么 我想让他看看自己都干了什么
放我走吧 我保证不会有下一次了
你知道下场是什么
Aleksey 你想离开这片森林 没门
我们会在这里把你干掉
奇怪 也许我翻译的时候遗漏了什么 Huh?

你不该来美国
这是你自找的
你要为此付出生命的代价
我会把你埋在十个不同的坟墓里
然后朝每个墓吐口水
不 他们想杀了他 No, they're gonna kill him.
你知道这不是虚张声势 对吧?

他们不是来逮捕他的 They're not out here to arrest that guy.
如果他们是的话 If they were,
这里肯定会有那种直升机什么的 there would be all kinds of helicopters
还有突击队员 and commando teams.
不对 他们就是过来杀他的 No, they're out here to execute him.
可能他们应该这么做 Maybe they should.
他是个恐怖分子 He's a terrorist.
我不知道他干过什么 I don't know what he did.
那不如我们假设 中情局的人 How about we all just assume the CIA
根本没有派这些坏蛋来抓这个 doesn't send three badasses after the guy
负责当地扶轮社的人 who's in charge of the local Rotary Club.
让我告诉你 Let me remind you.
Basayev现在生死一线 Basayev's ass is on the line.
你也一样 So is yours.
这是个秘密行动 This is a black op.
不管在这里发生了什么事 There is absolutely zero accountability
上头的人都不用负责任 for anything that happens out here.
所以如果你想插一脚 Abe Froman可能也会把你分尸 And if you get in the way, Abe Froman might just chop you up
埋在十个不同的地方 还朝坟墓吐口水 and spit on your grave ten different times.
说得挺有道理 That's a pretty good point.
我同意你的想法 No, I agree.
但是 过来 But, come here.
说实话 每次听他说的 Seriously, has anything good
有哪一次有好结果呢?

嘿 你知道我不用听 Hey, you know I don't have
就知道你在讲什么吧 to hear you to know what you're saying.
- 我们就是同一个人

拜托你们俩闭嘴好吗?

我正在考虑 I'm thinking.
是Carla Paz吗?

联邦探员?

联邦调查局的 有几个问题想问你 FBI, couple of questions.
是和你合作过的一些人 Some people you might've worked with.
好的 得快点 还有客户在等着我 Well, it'd have to be quick.

好的 那我们废话少说 Okay, here's the quick version.
Merrick Kellerman和Petrov Merrick, Kellerman and Petrov.
抽签吗?

你确定吗?

有记录他们的名字 以前都和你合作过 has it in their heads that you all worked together.
2011年 在车臣 Chechnya, 2011.
你们刚刚说的一切 我都不能再提了 Anything like that, you know I can't talk about it.
这只队伍又开始活动了 Your team is active again.
这次行动的地点在美国本土 Stateside this time.
他们找了一个帮手 这个人 They helped themselves to someone
对联邦调查局来说很重要 who's important to the FBI.
对我来说也很重要 Someone who's important to me.
我对Dean Merrick没有任何好感 I got no love for Dean Merrick.
所以我只能跟你们说 So I'll just tell you this.
我不知道他们的下落 I don't know where they are.
但是 如果队伍重组 开始行动的话 But if that team's working together again,
我觉的应该和Aleksey Basayev有关 it probably has to do with Aleksey Basayev.
嘿 Hey.
抱歉 Sorry.
听着 Uh, listen.
我要是说这个计划是要将Aleksey Basayev杀掉的话 If I told you that the plan was to kill Aleksey Basayev,
你会不会觉得惊讶?

你觉得呢?

他们有没有告诉过你我们究竟在做什么?

我只是个联络员 I'm a comms guy.
他们会告诉我执行任务的位置 They tell me where to bring my stuff
和签约任务的天数 and how many days I'm on contract.
我只要了解这么多就够了 I like it that way.
Cameron啊 Cameron,
我们现在身处美国 we're in the United States.
你刚刚叫我什么?

是啊 抱歉 那是我给你起的昵称 Yeah, sorry, that's a nickname thing.
我们不能直接杀掉那个家伙 We can't just kill that guy,
见他五马分尸 然后再乱葬各地 cut him up and bury him in a bunch of different holes.
那你去世界法庭投诉去啊 So file a case with the World Court.
听我说 这传出去就是个丑闻 Listen to me.

我们保护这个家伙活下去 We help keep this guy alive,
把他再关进监狱...

这样对我们两个人都好 it'll be good for both of us.
我是他们的实验体 伙计 I'm the science experiment, man.
我认识高层领导 I know people in high places.
你难道想这辈子都守着对讲机 You want to work a walkie

执行秘密任务吗?

我可以和海军领导谈谈 I could talk to the Navy.
没准还能把你调到海豹突击队去 Could maybe make you a SEAL.
Kellerman和Petrov都是冷血杀手 Kellerman and Petrov are stone killers.
就算你吃了那种药片 我们也是不可能击败他们的 No way we outflank them, even with that pill.
不 我们无需跟他们起冲突 No, we wouldn't even have to fight them.
你要做的就是不给他们留下 You just have to make it impossible
杀掉Basayev的机会 for them to kill Basayev.
你能控制通讯设备 You control the comms rig.
你可以给护林员发送一个遇难信号 You can put out a distress signal
引他们来这里 to the forest rangers, get them out here.
有平民在旁边的话 It's a lot harder to murder someone
想要杀人可就困难多了 when there are civilians around.
我在这里是发送不了遇难信号的 I can't make the distress call from here.
他们能知道这里发生的情况 We're in earshot.
我把我的设备都带出森林 I'll take my rig out to the woods,
告诉护林员我来爬山 结果走丢了 腿也受伤了 tell the rangers I'm a lost hiker with a broken leg.
好吧 All right.
成交 Good deal.
Aleksey Basayev在上一场车臣战争中 Aleksey Basayev fought for the Spetsnaz
为雪域特战队效力 in the last Chechen war.
战争结束后 他和当地的一名女子成婚 He married a local woman and stayed in Chechnya
然后就留在了车臣 after the fighting was over.
车臣通过汽车向外输送圣战分子 Chechnya exports jihadis by the busload.
Aleksey的岳父从中情局处拿钱 Aleksey's new father

保证身处他势力范围的 in exchange for a pledge
中情局探员不会落到坏人手里 to help keep the kids in his teip from going bad guy.
只不过他和两方都做了交易 Except he was working both sides.
把拿到的钱直接交给了塔利班 Sent the money straight on to the Taliban.
Basayev也参与这件事了吗?

没有 No, not at all.
Basayev答应帮助我们 Basayev agreed to help us
条件是 if we promised
让我们用药物快速将他的岳父绑出来 to abduct the father

我们同意了 We made the deal.
然后...

我们得知那里会出现一名塔利班军阀 we got word that there'd be a Taliban warlord there.
Merrick决定 Merrick decided
不给对方留下任何生还的机会 he didn't want to leave anything to chance.
所以你们轰炸了那片地区 You bombed the compound.
他的妻子 孩子...

还有其他所有人?

都死掉了 Killed.
这么说Basayev根本不是个恐怖分子?

他帮助了我们 He helped us.
塔利班得知 And when word got out
Basayev在轰炸前就离开那片地区之后 Basayev left just before the bomb hit,
就将他视作了叛徒 he got branded a traitor.
在那场攻击中 The brother
丧生的塔利班教长有个兄弟 of the Taliban mullah killed in the attack
他悬赏要杀掉Basayev put a price on his head.
给他带去尸体的话 可以拿到五百万美金 $5 million for his corpse.
活捉的话 $10 million
可以获得一千万美金 if you deliver him alive.
Basayev是来这里 Basayev came here
杀Merrick的 to kill Merrick.
所以Brian现在和三名雇佣兵 So Brian's in the woods with three mercenaries
以及一位命值千万赏金的家伙一同在森林里 and a guy with a $10 million bounty on his head.
看什么看?
想要弄清点事情
我会说俄语 会说一点
你和那些家伙看起来不太一样 不是个士兵...
我确实不是 Nyet.
那就放了我
那些人想要杀了我
离囚犯远点 Hey.

我的联络员哪里去了?

你懂的 Uh, you know.
解手去了 Call of duty.
我们和这位朋友 Yeah, well, we're about done
也快聊完了 懂吗?

得出去遛遛 Gonna take a walk.
遛遛?

你要是再问的话 If you ask me again,
我可能会告诉你答案 I might just give you the answer.
但你还是不知道比较好 You don't want that.
别管闲事 Stand down.
你很快就能回家了 You'll be home soon.
我觉得他们就要动手了 Yo, I think they're gonna do it now.
别紧张 都交给我吧 Relax, I got this.
嘿!

我告诉过你了 I told you.
不要叫名字...

你做了什么?

你为什么要这样做?

不会有人来的 There's no one coming.
我谁都没叫 I didn't call anybody.
Kellerman把我们带到了这里 Kellerman took us out here
审讯Basayev 然后要杀掉他 to interrogate Basayev, then kill him.
我和Petrov自有计划 Me and Petrov have our own plan.
我们要把他卖掉 We're gonna sell him
赚一千万美金 for $10 million.
我们没杀掉你是因为你身价六百万美元 You're alive 'cause you're the Six Million Dollar Man,
所以你是我们的保险 and that makes you our insurance policy.
我们打算悄悄地迅速离开这里 We plan to hike out of here, quick and quiet,
但要是出了岔子 but if anything goes south?
他们也不会炮轰你的 No way they drop artillery on you.
这么说你早就知道 So you knew.
我们行动的时候 This whole time we've been out here,
你一直都知道你们要杀掉他 you knew you were gonna kill him.
你要是影响我们行动...

做出些什么让我们紧张的行为的话 do anything to make me nervous?
那我不上保险也无所谓 I'm more than willing to go without insurance.
配合点...

我们离开这里之后 when we get out of here,
就放了你 we'll cut you loose.
放了你?

你信吗?

Rebecca?

我不会一直都以你的姿态出现 I'm not always going to be a version of you.
你服下的NZT快失效了 你需要建议 Your NZT is wearing off and you need advice.
我很乐意给你建议 I'm happy to give it.
或者说你脑海中的我 Or the version of me
很乐意给你建议 that lives inside of your head is happy to give it.
不过 Brian 说实话:

我真希望你别这么打扮我 I wish you didn't dress me like this.
但你要按Sloane的样子打扮啊 But you get to be Sloane.
Sloane最棒了 Sloane's the best.
这些人打算杀掉你 These people are going to kill you.
你知道这点的吧?

我知道你知道这点的 因为你就是我 I know you know it, because you're me.
他们是不会放过你的 They are not going to cut you loose.
所以你要是不做点什么的话 And if you don't do something,
就会死在这片树林里的 you are gonna die in these woods.
我口袋里面还有一枚药片 I still got that one pill in my pocket.
但就算服下了那枚药片 But even on the pill,
我觉得你也不可能和两个训练有素的士兵抗衡 I don't think you can take two trained soldiers.
而且你还要走很久才能离开这片树林 And you are a long way from the edge of the woods.
你有什么好主意吗?

现在可不是上演兄弟连的时候 This is not a Band of Brothers moment.
我们现在讨论的 We're talking about
可是两个为了瓜分一千万美元 two mercenaries who murdered their boss
而杀掉自己老大的雇佣兵 so they could split $10 million.
让他们反目 Turn one against the other.
不行 就算我能成功 No, but see, even if I can pull that off,
那也还会剩下一个武装在身的家伙 that leaves one heavily armed dude still standing.
你也有武器啊 You have a weapon, too.
你还记的Cameron说起NZT时的样子吗?

他要是知道你还有一枚药片的话 一定会非常想要吃掉它的 If he knew you had a pill, he'd be dying to take it.
很好 Okay, great.
那我们把他变成一个高度聪明的超级士兵 So we make him into a highly intelligent super soldier.
这主意真是棒极了 Sloane That's an awesome plan, Sloane.
我是说 得给你行个礼了 I mean, hats off to you.
我真希望物理定律 I wish the laws of physics
能允许我现在就把你掐死 would allow me to strangle you right now.
你手上有他想要的药片 You have a pill that he wants.
你还记得之前吃过商陆果实之后 Remember the book that you read
看过的那本书吗?

你想要我给他下毒 You want me to poison him.
你想让我杀人?

抱歉 I'm sorry.
确实如此 I really am.
但我想让你活下去 But I want you to live.
也就是说这些家伙必须死 Which means these guys have to die.
这个小玩意能让你不受蚊子困扰 Little something to keep the mosquitoes away.
快速提问 Quick question.
那边的那个兄弟真是那种 Does your buddy over there really strike you
愿意跟你五五分的人吗?

你说有人愿意花一千万美金 You said Basayev's worth
买Basayev的命 $10 million to someone.
所以我猜你们一定会以某种方式分掉那笔赏金 I'm guessing you guys are doing some kind of split.
但以我对那位安静 神经质 But if I know my quiet, psycho,
急需温暖的雇佣兵的了解 in

最后真能分成赏金我才觉得奇怪呢 I'd be surprised if there winds up being a split at all.
他已经指使你杀了你们的老大 He already got you to shoot your boss.
Basayev也已经到手了 Basayev's all bound up.
他为什么不独吞了所有赏金呢?

我们达成了协议 We made a deal.
哦 你们达成了协议啊 Oh, you made a deal.
你们握手成交了啊?

好吧 那就是板上钉钉的事情了 当我什么都没说好了 Well, that's ironclad.

当然了 Of course,
你也可以把他除掉 you could take him out.
这一次 要赢得漂亮 Walk away a winner for once.
我需要他 I need him.
只有他能联系上带走Basayev He's got the connect to the heroin traffickers
然后拿钱回来的毒品贩子 who are gonna bring Basayev back to the guy with the money.
你需要他 Yeah, you need him.
那他需要你吗?

听着 Listen, man.
我服下的药片快要失效了 My pill's about to wear off,
但我还有一片 but I've got one more.
我一直都把它装在我的口袋里 It's been in my pocket this entire time.
你要是能搞定那个翻译的话 我就服下那片药 If you get rid of the translator, I'll take it.
要把Basayev交到想要他的人的手中 It can't be that hard to figure out a way
总不是件难事吧 to get Basayev to the people that want him.
那可是一千万美金啊 That's $10 million.
全归你了 All for you.
要不你就跟着你搭档的计划走吧 Or whatever your pal has planned.
脑袋上戴着黑头套的话 You can't see much of the woods
是看不清周围情况的 when you've got a black bag over your head.
但要是能把结系松一些 But if you work the tie loose,
就能看到你脚下的植物了 you can see what's growing at your feet.
某些...

多谢你 Dan教练 Thank you, Counselor Dan.
你想要我摆出一副 It seems like you want me to be,
尴尬或是怀有歉意的态度来吗?

你背叛了自己的线人 You betrayed your own source
还轰炸了一个 and then bombed a compound
内有二十人的地区 with more than 20 people inside of it.
我们就先假设 For argument's sake, let's just say
我承认指挥了 I'm willing to admit to the operation
你们描述的那场行动 you guys are describing.
是的 Yes.
我指挥了一架无人机 I called in a drone.
地面上的情况变了 The facts on the ground changed,
所以我也改变了计划 so I changed the plan.
一切行动都没违背法律 All perfectly legal.
现在你们又在美国领土上 And now you're staging a black op on American soil
进行一场违背行政指令的秘密行动 in direct violation of an executive order prohibiting it.
那你去投诉啊 So file an injunction.
拿出证据来啊 Prove it.
要有什么新进展再给我打电话 Call me if you get anywhere with that.
你在车臣的所作所为 What you did in Chechnya
可能不违法 might not have been illegal.
但绝对是个好故事 But it would make for a good story.
美国军方背叛一名线人 Americans betraying a source,
轰炸了他家人所在的地区 bombing a compound with his family inside.
我都能看到这故事上某家报纸头条的样子了 I could see that on the front page of a paper somewhere.
你们想要怎样?

几个小时之后他应该就能乘着直升机回家了 He should be on a chopper home in a few hours.
我要和Brian说话 I want to talk to Brian.
我要知道他现在平安 I want to know he's okay.
见鬼 Oh, hell.
该死 是Merrick Damn, it's Merrick.
我告诉你接下来该怎么做 I need to tell you what I'm gonna do,
别耍花招好吗?

我明白 I think I got it.
你们组长呢?

遇到点麻烦 我们也没办法 Problems.

那目标呢?

正被我们押着去撤离点 In our custody and on the way to the extraction point.
总的来说 超出预计用时 Running behind schedule, is all.
大概...

目标隐藏在深林里 Target was deep in the bush.
我们的线人呢?

比屎壳郎走得还慢 Other than being slow as a dung beetle,
更糟的是被蚊子咬了 还起了水疱 worst he's got is mosquito bites and blisters.
我要跟他说话 I want to talk to him.
他不是说了...

快连线他 Merrick Put him on now, Merrick.
有几个紧张兮兮的家伙也来了 We got a couple of nervous Nellies here at the barn,
想和线人说话 want a word with the resource.
收到 Copy that.
过来 Brian!

嘿 筒子们 Hey, guys.
是Naz?

那边怎么样 Brian?

跟他说的差不多 Well, it's pretty much like the man said.
刚进入丛林的时候 You know, it got hairy there
确实有点吓人 for a minute, out here in the forest.
有点冷 有点凉 It's a little brisk, little bit cold.
不过还好 我穿得多 So luckily, I've just been bundled up,
在沃伦县一点也没冻着 keeping warm in my warren,
一切都好 all safe and sound.
就像你们教我的那样 是吧?

把我扔在孤岛上?

诸如此类的?

你没事吧?

其实我觉得我得了红眼病 You know what, I think I got the pinkeye.
你能看到吗?

好了 他来了 Okay, there he is.
等会我们会给他患处抹点药膏的 We'll put some ointment on whatever's bugging him,
让他毫发无损地回去见你们 get him back to you shipshape.
还有什么事吗?

12小时后联系 12 hours.
明白 Copy all.
这下高兴了?

我一点也不高兴 No, I am not happy.
有人在杀人 People are being killed out there,
我的顾问也身处险境 and my consultant's in the middle of it.
你在干嘛?

你不觉得Brian过于活跃了吗?

就好像他试图表达些什么 Almost like he was trying to emphasize certain words
却又不想引人注意?

我一直觉得他太活跃了 He always seems overly cheerful to me.
不过那又怎么了?

他说在沃伦县 深入丛林?

快看这个 Check this out.
沃伦和弗雷斯县 Warren and Forest Counties
占据了阿勒格尼国家公园内的大部分 are mostly made up of the Allegheny State Park.
最后他说孤岛 That last thing about being an island.
公园有一小部分 There's a little section of the park
远离各县 that runs along those counties.
阿勒格尼群岛荒野保护区 Allegheny Islands Wilderness area.
他在暗示我们地点 He's drawing us a map.
你最好乖乖的 You better be right about this.
天啊 Oh, my God.
不 不 No, no, no.
把头转回来 Don't turn away.
你想要的就是这样 This is what you wanted.
好好看着 Take a good look.
现在把药给我吧 Now you're gonna hand me that pill.
除了我 别人都不能服这药 No one else can take it.
你说只有超过一定剂量才会有副作用 You said the side effects happen after a few doses.
快给我 Hand it over.
最后一片我要吃下 I'm taking the last one.
感受感受当诸葛亮的感觉 I get to see what it feels like to be the smart guy.
额...

你 应该向后 you, uh, should probably
看一看 look behind you.
等等!

我会杀了你老婆的
等等 我说错了 Wait, wait, that doesn't sound right.
我不会说俄语 I can't speak Russian.
NZT的药效过了 I'm not on NZT, okay?
我是想救你的 I tried to save you.
我不希望你死的 I tried to keep you alive.
把药给我 Give me the pill.
你会说英语?

谁不会说两句英语?

我拿不到 I can't.
谢谢 Thank you.
这个药片 This pill,
能告诉你答案?

解决问题?

是的 但它...

这重担 This weight,
一直在我身上 all the time it is on me.
我很需要答案 明白吗?

我失去了很多 I have lost so much.
只想拥有平静 I only want peace.
那药片给不了你的 You won't get it from that pill, though.
它有毒的 It's poisoned.
真的 我往里面掺了 Seriously, I mixed it
莨菪粉(有毒) with Belladonna.
会毒死你的 It could kill you.
那也算解脱吧 That's a kind of peace, too.
听天由命吧
我想走出森林 I tried to find the edge of the woods,
但是我没服NZT but I wasn't on NZT.
记不住地形 I couldn't remember the maps.
晚上的时候 At the end of the day,
我又回到了原点 I just circled right back to where I started.
# Brian来到埃及啦 # # When Brian was in Egypt's land #
# 让他去吧 # # Let my Brian go.

假期结束了 So much for taking the day off.
可我做不到啊 I don't think I can do this.
靠你的脑子可以的 It's all in your head.
快起来 Get up.
我要死了 I'm dying.
你不会死的 You're not dying.
你只是有点迷茫罢了 You just can't think of anything good to do.
但全都乱套了 But this is all wrong.
我像Ferris一样(电影"跷课天才"主人公) Now, I'm Ferris.
本应该一切顺利的 Everything's supposed to work out for me.
不 No.
你应该付出努力 You have to make it work.
怎么努力?

Brian啊?

Brian 醒醒 Brian, wake up.
你做到了 You did it.
你救了Ferris You saved Ferris.
第一个死掉的是Rooney First to die was Rooney.
抱歉 Um, sorry.
是Kellerman Kellerman.
Rooney是我给他起的绰号 Rooney was just a nickname I gave him.
从此以后 我明白了 After that, I figured, um,
要想活下去 if I was gonna survive,
就得想个法子 I needed to figure out a way
杀掉Hollinger和Petrov to kill Hollinger and Petrov.
所以我说服Cameron...

他真名叫什么?

叫Kyle Hollinger Kyle Hollinger.
我曾说服他向Abe Froman开枪 Right, I convinced him to shoot Abe Froman.
然后我就想办法 Uh, then I just had to figure out
骗他服下毒药 how to get him to swallow the poison.
不过还好Aleksey Basayev帮我把他干掉了 And Aleksey Basayev took care of that for me.
挺走运的 是吧 Luckily, or I guess.
所以...

你认为Aleksey Basayev在 Do you think Aleksey Basayev
杀死Kyle Hollinger之前 gained any intel from Kyle Hollinger
有没有得到情报?

额...

我听到唯一的声音 Well, the only thing I heard
就是他被自己的血呛到 was the sound of him choking on his own blood.
不好意思 Excuse me.
基本上就这些了 Naz Yeah, anyway, that's pretty much it, Naz.
Brian啊 Brian.
你原本不需要 This should never
经历这些的 have happened to you.
是我对不住你 And it's my fault that it did.
不 命令不是你签的 No, you didn't sign the order.
不 No, no,
保护你是我的责任 you are my responsibility.
虽然话都说开了 Now, you and I have had our moments,
但我向你保证 but I want you to know I will find
一定会让他们付出代价的 the people responsible for this.
你真的相信Naz并不知情?

她确实冒了很大风险把你弄回来 She really stuck her neck out to get you back.
所以我信她 So I think I do.
你没事吧?

刚才那么匆忙地走了 You ducked out of that meeting kind of fast.
你问我?

又不是我刚刚 I'm not the one that just survived
从森林里死里逃生 some backwoods nightmare.
刚才听你讲那些经过 感觉好冷漠 Hearing you talk about it, you sound so detached.
你刚来的时候 When you first came here,
虽然总遇到困难 you were in a bad patch,
但你还是有自己看待问题的方式 but you still had this way of looking at things.
就像...

还没被这个世界打磨 Like the world hadn't touched you yet.
我想留住那样的你 I think I wanted to protect that.
所以才大费周章把你弄过来 I think that's why I fought so hard to get you here.
可是 你...

看到人们互相伤害 却...

我找到你的时候 你脸上还有别人的血 You had someone else's blood on your face when I found you.
你知道吗?

我本想请一天假 I was gonna take a day off,
没想到却发生了这么多 before all this.
今天早上起床的时候 Man, I was so happy
我很开心 when I woke up that morning.
就好像回到了从前 It felt like before.
那些快乐的时光 Like the good parts of before.
很抱歉让你面对了那些 I'm sorry you had to see those things.
让你不得不做那些事情 I'm really sorry you had to do those things.
我别无选择 I didn't have much of a choice in that.
不这样 It was either this
就会在金星餐厅端盘子 or being a fry cook on Venus.
天啊 Oh, my God.
你真的从没看过"跷课天才" You've really never seen Ferris Bueller before,
是吧?

知道吗?

我明白了 I got it.
我父母家的录影带里就有这部电影 I have it on VHS at my parents' place.
我们一起去看 We're gonna watch it right now.
- Mike!

漂亮 Beautiful.
太漂亮了 Even more beautiful.
嘿 你迷路了吗?

带你一程?

我的胃难受 My stomach feel strange.
吃小熊糖吗?

你怎么还在看?

这集结束了 The show's over.
快去睡觉 Go to bed.
快去 Go.
