我是Brian Finch My name is Brian Finch.
是个生活一团糟的28岁小青年 I was your average 28

不过吃了NZT之后 一切就变了 until I took a pill called NZT.
瞬间我就能善用每一个脑细胞 Suddenly I had access to every brain cell.
所以联邦调查局雇用我 And that's why the FBI hired me.
我是Brian Finch My name's Brian Finch,
她是Rebecca Harris this is Rebecca Harris,
我们是联邦调查局的 and we're with the FBI.
天啊 听起来好赞 God, that sounds cool.
不过 有一个问题 There's just one problem.
NZT会透支你的生命 NZT will kill you,
除非你注射了这玩意儿 unless you have this shot.
现在起 你可以随心所欲的服用NZT 并且毫无副作用 Now you can have as much NZT as you want with no side effects.
我叫Sands My name's Sands.
你现在属于Morra先生了 意味着 You belong to Mr.

你属于我了 you belong to me.
我们对NZT有所了解 We know quite a lot about NZT.
但联邦调查局不是省油的灯 FBI's playing catch

我要你找出联邦调查局对NZT的了解程度 I want you to find out exactly what they know
然后带来给我 and bring it to me.
我复制了这份档案 I made a copy of this file.
你别管我是怎么弄到的 I can't tell you exactly how I got it.
但我真的认为你该看看其中的内容 But I do think you should know what's inside.
联邦调查局的人知道你爸爸死之前正在服用NZT The FBI knew your father was on NZT before he died.
Rebecca 在你刚在CJC工作时 Rebecca, they've known since
他们就已经知道了 before you started working at the CJC.
你从哪弄到的?

Naz的办公室 Naz's office.
你偷来的?

他们天天给我吃那药 They're giving me that drug every day.
Naz把联邦调查局研究的卷宗都给我看了 Naz showed me the files on the FBI studies.
没错 但你父亲并非联邦调查局的实验对象 Yeah, but your dad wasn't part of the FBI trials.
他们另外还在调查那些 They were also tracking civilians
他们认为可能正在服用NZT的平民 who they thought might be using NZT.
Naz为什么没告诉我这事?

你为什么要告诉我 不怕我把你送进监狱吗?

我觉得你想知道 I thought you'd want to know.
确实 I do.
我想知道 为什么我的老板 I want to know why my boss has a file
藏着一份关于我父亲的文件 但不告诉我 on my murdered father and didn't tell me.
我想知道发生在我父亲身上的事情 I want to know what happened to him,
我想知道这和联邦调查局有什么关系 I want to know what the FBI had to do with it.
让我来帮你 I'll help you.
我们不能让别人知道 We can't let anyone know
我们在做什么 what we're doing.
上面并没有写明是谁在跟踪你父亲 It doesn't say who was following your dad
也没写联邦调查局跟他多久了 or how long the FBI was tracking him.
只有你父亲的背景资料 Just some background on him.
还有这个笔记 And this one note.
"上东城NZT群" "Upper East Side NZT cluster."
我父亲曾是个画家 My dad was a painter.
他的生活一塌糊涂 He was broke his whole life.
他跟那个上东城根本没有什么关系 There was nothing Upper East Side about him.
但是他是去那里戒毒的 Well, no, he went to rehab there.
新泉康复中心 The, uh...

那地方住一星期得好几千呢!

名流才去那里 Celebrities go there.
他没那么多钱 He couldn't afford that.
但是他确实去了 Well, he was there.
我是说 上面写他2013年9月从那出院了 I mean, it says he was discharged September 2013.
联邦调查局认为他就从上东城弄到NZT的 And the FBI thinks he got his NZT from the Upper East Side.
- 值得调查一下

我不想把他扯进来 I don't want to drag him into this.
我打算告诉他 我正在 I'll tell him I'm running something down
为我以前的老大查案 for my old boss in Criminal.
那Mike和Ike怎么办?

我会跟他们说你在帮我干活 I'll tell them you're working on something for me.
接下来几天你行动自由 You need to be able to come and go for a few days.
好的 All right.
就这样?

我们准备好要查了吧?

Brian啊?

- 嗯?

我只知道 我现在拉你下水了 I'm pretty sure I just made you an accessory to a crime.
你不用谢我 You don't have to thank me.
- 早上好

Rebecca 到我办公室来一下 好吗?

好的 Sure.
我觉得你应该知道红队吧?

你是说战争游戏吗?

五角大楼为了测试探员们应对不同 The Pentagon stages inter

威胁时的警惕性推出的内部练习 to test our readiness for different threat scenarios.
现在 他们正在关注 This time they're looking at
当经济遭遇网络攻击时会发生什么 what could happen in the wake of a cyberattack on the economy.
蓝队代表美国 A blue team represents the U.

由华盛顿特区出人 and its interests from Washington.
红队代表地方 驻扎在纽约 A red team play the enemy, based here in New York.
我会和EAD的Paulson I will be working with EAD Paulson
一起带领红队 to head up that red team.
听起来很光荣的任务 Sounds like quite an honor.
没错 但也是一份责任 Yeah, it is.

所以他们让我带一名 Which is why they've asked me to select
最具潜力的探员一起参加 an exceptional agent to participate this time.
你意下如何?

听起来很诱人 That's very flattering.
我现在有个棘手的案子 I have a brutal case load right now.
Boyle可以帮你 So maybe Boyle could help you.
我选了你 I chose you.
Avery局长在上位的时候 已经参加过 Director Avery played on three different red teams
三次红队的任务 when he was coming up.
仕途就是这样缔造的 This is how careers are made.
你说什么?

她的笑容 就像是我们之间 She smiled at me like we were sealing
签订了什么不平等条约一样 some kind of pact or something.
这女人不是我导师 That woman is not my mentor.
不 她觉得她是 No, but she thinks she is.
所以你得顺着她来 And you got to kind of let her.
我是说 你知道这事身不由己 是吗?

整整三天待在Naz身边 It's three days of sitting right beside Naz.
没错 不过有一个好处 That's true, but on the bright side,
能让她有事忙 it does keep her busy.
另外 你可以扮演敌方 不是吗?

我是说 你现在 I mean, you're kind of mad
对所有有关军工的东西都很反感 at the whole military

那就把它统统消灭 So burn it all to the ground.
街道上毫无秩序 Anarchy in the streets.
你把自己当成纽约市的野蛮女王 You make yourself the barbarian queen of New York City.
我去戒毒中心 看看能不能找到 And I'll go to the rehab center and see what I can find
- 你爸爸的线索

偷偷进去的时候 千万别被抓 Just...

我不打算偷跑进去 I'm not gonna break in.
嗨 我叫Mike Ikerson 我是个瘾君子 Hi, my name is Mike Ikerson, and I'm an addict.
欢迎来到新泉 Welcome to New Springs.
告诉我 你有...

简而言之 Mike Ikerson有问题 Suffice it to say, Mike Ikerson has issues.
我知道 他们都看着...

大家好 我叫Mike Hi, everybody.

有很多问题 A lot of issues.
我 嗯 很高兴来到这里 I'm, uh, happy to be here.
虽然我觉得他在小组讨论时 I do think he made some breakthroughs
有了些突破 in group therapy, though.
可惜的是 也只有 Unfortunately, there was only
那么点时间用来反省 so much time for introspection.
谢谢 Ah, thank you.
最终 我终于找到了那些文件 And I got myself in front of those files eventually.
在我阅读完所有文件后 After I made my way through all of them,
Mike Ikerson就戒毒完毕 准备面对世界了 Mike Ikerson was ready to face the world a sober man.
好了 太感谢了!

我感觉好多了 I feel a lot better.
先生 你还好吗?

先生?

经查 突发的听力和视觉变化 It turns out there are plenty of exciting reasons
造成原因都很大条...

脑肿瘤 Brain tumors.
中风...

嘿 Hey.
嘿 Hey.
找到线索了吗?

不是很多 Not a ton.
我是说 你爸爸完成了所有的质量 I mean, your dad made it all the way through treatment.
根据文件记载 With flying colors,
中间还乐趣不断 according to his file.
我爸爸很擅长勾搭治疗专家 My dad was good at charming therapists.
就这些吗?

有一件事 Uh, there was one thing.
你父亲的档案里有个注释 Your dad had this notation in his file.
"每周由A.

我读了和他同时期进行治疗的 I read the files of everyone who was there
所有人的档案 at the same time as him.
只有四个人的档案上有同样的注释 There were only four people who had that notation.
你知道那是什么意思吗?

我是说 这些人都和你爸爸有某种联系 Well, I mean, they're all connected to your dad somehow.
也就是说我们要是找到其中一个的话 So if we could track one of them down,
也许就能问出些什么 maybe they know something.
把他们的名字给我 Well, give me the names.
我今晚得研究这个大项目 I have to digest this enormous thing
不过也许我能帮上你的忙 by tomorrow, but maybe I can help.
Brian 你怎么了?

你没事吧?

还好 Yeah.
呃...

我觉得我可能得了严重的鼻窦炎什么的 Think I have bad sinuses or something.
也可能得了感冒 Probably coming down with a cold.
你应该回家休息一下 You should go home.
谢谢你帮我找了这个名单 Oh, thank you for this.
谢谢你帮我查这整件事 And for doing this.
总之谢谢你了 All of it.
严重的鼻窦炎?

你不用上网也知道这是怎么回事吧 You don't need the Internet to know what's up with you.
你从Naz的办公室偷了那些文件 When you stole those files from Naz's office,
还记得关于政府对NZT研究的视频吗?

对NZT

第十一天 human trials for NZT

在过去的24小时中 In the last 24 hours, four patients
四名实验者出现了视物变形症 describe episodes of metamorphopsia
并发性失语症 and concurrent aphasia.
是啊 她提到了视线扭曲 Yeah, she's talking about distorted vision.
难以理解言语的症状 Difficulty understanding speech.
这些都是NZT的副作用 伙计 You're having NZT side effects, buddy.
你注射的免疫针效果正在减退 Your immunity shot's wearing off.
你犯了反叛罪 但Sands答应你的 Where's that booster shot Sands promised you
免疫针又在哪儿呢?

我还在想你要多久才会联系我呢 I was wondering how long it take you to get in touch.
感觉怎么样 Brian?

我需要注射免疫针了 I need that shot.
最近看到白色闪光了吗?

说出来的话也不太对劲了吗?

你为什么想让我出现副作用反应呢?

我们希望你能有个正确的心态 We want to get you in the right frame of mind.
听着 议员有个任务要交给你 You see, the Senator has a job for you.
是关于Rebecca Harris的 It's Rebecca Harris.
我和Morra先生说你和她之间的关系日益加深 I told Mr.

我们担心这种关系会对你产生影响 We're concerned it's a distraction.
你有什么好担心的?

我能按你说的做就好 你担心什么?

还有就是她父亲的问题 There's also the issue of her father.
她有特别的动机 She has the potential to be uniquely motivated
调查NZT to investigate NZT.
我们不希望她这么做 We'd prefer she didn't.
我们希望她消失 We want her gone.
我不是说要杀了她 伙计 I'm not telling you to murder her, mate.
只要让她远离你就好了 Just get her away from you.
只要有人发现Harris探员 If Agent Harris were to be found in possession
有Naz办公室里那些档案的话 of those files from Naz's office,
问题就能解决了吧 I'd imagine that would do the trick.
所以你打算让我陷害她?

那样的话 她会被联邦调查局除名的 That would get her kicked out of the FBI.
她还会进监狱 She'd go to jail.
就是这个意思 That's the idea.
不 No.
我是不会那样做的 I'm not doing that ever.
你们得再想别的办法 So, you're gonna have to think of something else.
Brian 你要不要再考虑一下?

我们是不会改变 As always the only way
提出的方案的 is the way we prescribe.
你觉得该对这个女人忠诚 You feel some loyalty to this woman.
暂时来说 没什么要紧的 That's fine for now.
一两天之后呢?

等你的大脑像着火了一样的时候呢?

为了注射免疫针 You'll be willing to skin
让你剥了Rebecca Harris的皮你都乐意 Rebecca Harris alive for that shot.
我们还是不要让事情发展到那个地步 好吗?

永无止境 第一季第6集
事态的发展出乎了预料 Things are not as they should be.
在过去的一周内 Over the past week, subjects have complained
实验者出现了失忆 about memory loss,
仅供翻译交流使用, 禁止用于商业用途
严重的妄想症...

把它们从我身体里拿出去!

我们观察到了迅速衰老 We see signs of rapid aging
协调校对:

和侵害性精神病的症状 and encroaching psychosis.
停止NZT的使用 Attempts to discontinue NZT use
翻译:

导致一名实验者出现严重的戒断症状 sent one patient into a withdrawal
我们目前使用药物 so severe that we currently have him
让该实验者陷入了昏迷状态 in a medically induced coma.
我找到你们的微型芯片了!

目前我们仍无法得出结论...

继续供给药片和戒断药片 providing the pills
究竟哪个更为危险 or withholding them.
有什么问题吗?

我要是吃了这个药片 就会出现副作用 If I take that pill, I get side effects.
但如果我想 But if I want to be smart enough
想出清除副作用的方法 to figure out how to stop the side effects,
那我就得吃下这个药片 I have to take the pill.
是啊 确实有问题 Yeah, there's a problem.
你难道不应该去弄清 Aren't you supposed to be finding out
她爸爸究竟出了什么事吗?

我会去的 Yeah, I'll get to that.
不过我现在出了点状况 I'm in a little bit of a situation at the moment.
我注意到了 I noticed.
我们来想想你现在有什么选择 Well, let's run your options.
我可以弄清Morra议员 I could figure out how to make
给我注射的免疫针中的成分 whatever's in that shot that Senator Morra gave me.
不过...

他用了数个月 花了上百万美元才研制出来 it took him months and millions of dollars to do that.
我没有那个条件 Doesn't work on our timeline.
我也可以找其他持有那种免疫针的人 I could find someone else who has the shot.
还有谁有呢?

政府要是知道怎么制作这种免疫针的话 就不需要你了 If the government knew how to make it, they wouldn't need you.
那发明NZT的人呢?

你知道是谁发明的吗?

肯定不知道 因为你要是知道的话 我就知道 Doubt it, 'cause if you know it, I know it.
而我不知道 And I don't know it.
那我停止服用NZT呢?

直接转身走开 不干了 Just walk away, quit.
当然可以 Sure.
然后政府就会以违背协议的罪名 Then the government throws you in jail
把你关进监狱 for violating your agreement with them.
当然你也有可能先死于戒断反应 If the withdrawal doesn't kill you first.
最不济的办法?

你觉得按照Sands的要求做怎么样?

你是说陷害Rebecca?

这行不通 Not an option.
那你打算怎么着?

饱受折磨 痛苦又缓慢地死去?

更行不通了 Really not an option.
我直接去见Morra议员怎么样?

也许我和他能探讨出一个 Maybe he and I can work something out
不用将Rebecca送进监狱的办法 that doesn't mean sending Rebecca to jail.
太冒险了 It's risky.
每次你一跳过Sands办事 就会发生不好的事情 Every time you go around Sands, bad things happen.
还能比痛苦又缓慢的死去更不好吗?

怎么能接近Morra议员那种人呢?

想要接近他确实不容易 It's not easy to get to him,
不过应该可以找和他关系密切的人谈一谈 but it might be possible to talk to people close to him.
你好 我手上有一份 Hi there.

Morra议员和多数党领导人妻子上床的视频 of Senator Morra in bed with the majority leader's wife.
后来还有第三个人加入来着 A third party jumps in there too after a while.
不过现在我还不知道那是谁 Not sure who that is yet.
我可以把这个卖给别人 I was gonna put it on the market.
不知道你们这里有没有人想先从我这里把视频买走啊?

稍等 Wait for it.
马上就出来了 Any minute now.
哈哈!

骗到你们啦!

没错 我确实没有Eddie Morra So no, I didn't have video of
玩3P的视频 Eddie Morra having a threesome.
不过离开他办公室的时候 But by the time I left his offices,
我身上有了和视频价值相当的东西:

议员办公室外勤领导的手机 a cell phone belonging to the director of his field office,
从日历上判断 他儿子的生日在4月10号 whose son's birthday, I saw on her calendar, is April 10.
Morra先生 我是Brian Finch Mr.

我急需找你谈谈 就你我二人 拜托了 It's urgent that we speak.

喔哇 Whoa.
实验者12号声称出现了时间紊乱的症状 Subject 12 complains of time displacement.
我会跟你联系的
Edward Morra发来的信息 Text from Edward Morra.
这是我收到的唯一回复 That was the only response I got.
我现在只能等下去了 All I could do was wait.
欢迎加入红队 Welcome to the red team.
我们是一队 We are a group of
受中国指使的破坏分子 Chinese

目标是破坏美国经济 with a mandate to destroy the U.

我们现在需要进行第一步行动了 and we've got the first move.
有人有想法吗?

真的要我点名吗?

Rebecca Harris有想法 Rebecca Harris,
Rebecca与我一同在纽约CJC工作...

她在准备过程当中提出了一些有趣的想法 she had some interesting thoughts during prep.
是吗 Harris探员?

如果问题是:

手中的资源摧毁经济的话 with the resources we've got,
那答案是 做不到 we can't.
还有别人有什么想法吗?

在当前条件下 In the current conditions,
如果只是小打小闹 那我们的人力 we have enough manpower to launch one sabotage op,
足够发动一场破坏行动了 if we aren't too ambitious.
但我们需要更多的资源 We need to create more resources.
我们需要抗议者和抢劫犯 We need protestors and looters.
我们需要制造混乱 We need chaos.
我们可以利用社交媒体散布谣言 We can use social media to spread rumors
声称警察组织濒临瓦解 that cops are cracking down.
我们需要一张可以刺激人们的图像 We would need an image that would galvanize people,
我觉得可以发布一张防暴警察 so I say we stage a photo of a cop in riot gear
枪杀社区领袖的照片 shooting a community leader.
我们要怎么弄到那照片呢?

不惜一切代价 哪怕真的枪杀一个人也好 However we have to, even if we have to shoot someone.
新人初露锋芒 Protege comes to play.
还是没收到Morra议员的回复 Still waiting to hear something,
什么回复都没有 anything, from Senator Morra.
我是说 他就不能给我发条信息吗?

- 怎么...

嘿 Hey.
你还好吗?

什么?

还好 我刚刚喝了些热茶 对我的鼻窦炎有效果 Yeah, I just had some hot tea.

今天过得怎么样?

有没有征服纽约什么的 Conquering New York and whatnot.
有没有取下一堆敌人首级 一统敌方什么的?

还没 Not yet.
不过我确实和Naz拉关系来着 I did bond with Naz though.
至少她觉得我们是一条心的 At least she thinks we bonded.
那就让她这么想 Well, let her.
要让她觉得一切都很正常 She has to think things are normal.
但是事情一点都不正常 Well, things are anything but normal.
话说回来 我今天做了一点调查 Speaking of which, I did some research today.
- 那是我爸爸

我追查了你爸爸在康复小组的那些人 I tracked down those people from your dad's rehab group.
他们到新泉康复中心治疗时 All of them were at absolute bottom
无疑都处于人生的底端 when they went into treatment at New Springs.
你爸爸刚被逮捕了 Your dad had just been arrested.
Marcus Tate刚被第三次控告酒驾 Marcus Tate had his third DUI.
而Susan Epstein的女儿 Susan Epstein's own daughter
把她留在了急诊室的走廊外 left her on the sidewalk outside of an E.

但当他们一出康复中心 But the moment they got out,
一切都改变了 things changed.
你的父亲又开始作画了 Your father started painting again.
Marcus Tate酗酒前是个承包商 Marcus Tate was a contractor before he was an addict.
等他出了康复中心 After he got out of rehab,
他把自己家的房子重新搭建了起来 he rebuilt his family's house from the ground up.
- 他自己建的?

Jeremy Dyer...

拿到了四项专利 six months he got clean.
其中一项专利卖了一千一百万美元 He sold one for $11 million.
我是说所有参加康复中心每周咨询的人 I mean, everyone who was at that weekly consult
生命都获得了重大转折 with A.

- 你觉得他们都服用了NZT

在新泉康复中心 获得如此转折的 These five people were the only ones at New Springs
只有这五个人 who turned their lives around like that.
但是他们还有另外一个共同点 But they did have one other thing in common.
他们都失踪了吗?

没有一点线索 Gone without a trace.
唯一找到的就是你的父亲 The only one I could actually account for is your dad,
而这仅仅因为 and that's just because
他在...

- 他的尸体在东河里被发现

他们在一个月里都相继消失了?

嗯哼 Mm

莱克星顿大道613号?

是的 我去拜访了 Yeah, so I went to see
这几个人的家属 the families of everyone here.
我掘地三尺去找了他们留下的一切...

手机 地址簿 日历 cell phones, address books, calendars.
从新泉康复中心出来之后 After their time at New Springs,
他们都分道扬镳了 they all went their separate ways.
除了他们每周都会在那个地址相聚 Except, once a week, they all met at that address.
那是什么地方?

我给你看 I'll show you.
Ubient的故事不仅仅只是 The story of Ubient is not just a story
医药生产的故事 of pharmaceutical manufacturing,
它还是一小部分人 it's the story of a small group of people
把他们对开发人类大脑潜力的热情 who took their fascination with unlocking the potential
引领上世界舞台的故事 of the human brain to the world stage.
我们对神经药理学的热情 Our passion for neuropharmacology
触发了我们决定去寻找...

所以我爸爸和那些人...

都在服用NZT 而且每周 they were taking NZT, and once a week,
他们都要去制造神经强化剂 they went to an office for a company
公司的办公室?

你觉得他们是在研究NZT吗?

如果就是他们发明了NTZ呢?

我们要找出来AE是谁 We need to figure out who "A.

对 不开玩笑 Yeah, no kidding.
如果那个公司知道NZT If that company knows about NZT,
那他们也许就知道Rebecca的爸爸出了什么事 then they might know what happened to Rebecca's dad,
也知道怎样消除这些副作用 and they might know how to stop these side effects, too.
Morra参议员没有回复 Senator Morra's gone silent.
所以要是有人能帮我 只有这些人了 So if anyone's gonna help me, it's these guys.
副作用可能包括...

失忆 严重的狂想症 Memory loss, extreme paranoia,
迅速衰亡 侵害型精神病 rapid aging, encroaching psychosis.
这是Andrew Epperly "Andrew Epperly."
我昨天挖掘了很多他的信息 I did a lot of digging around last night.
有很多在Ubient工作的人的名字缩写 There are plenty of people with the initials A.

是AE 但我想这就是我们要找的人 that work at Ubient, but I think this is our guy.
- 神经化学?

他的名字遍布了这些研究论文...

神经药物调节睡眠 neurochemical regulation of sleep,
化学突触处理 chemical synapse manipulation.
这一张是他在Ubient做的人体试验 This one is on the human trials he ran at Ubient
药物治疗痴呆 with drugs on dementia.
等等 哇 人体试验?

如果你爸爸和其他病人 What if your dad and those patients
都参加了某种实验呢?

就是服用NZT You know, for NZT.
假如Andrew Epperly在做这个试验 I mean, if Andrew Epperly was running them,
也就解释了为什么他要去活泉见那些人 maybe that's why he went to see them at New Springs.
糟糕的是我们问不了他 It's too bad we can't ask him.
他死了 He's dead.
他去年死于一次船只事故 He died in a boating accident
就在缅因州海岸边 off the coast of Maine last year.
好吧...

就算他在做什么试验 even if he was running some kind of trial,
他也不能一个人来完成 he wouldn't have been able to do it by himself.
一定还有在Ubient的人知道些什么 There's got to be someone else at Ubient that knows something.
假如你找到了就告诉我 Let me know what you find out.
- 我得走了

嘿 Finch Hey, Finch.
Finch啊 Finch.
嘿 Hey.
Boyle 怎么了?

嘿 Rebecca不在的时候 Hey, well, you know, I'm covering a couple
我负责管理她的几个案子 of Rebecca's cases while she's out,
- 嗯哼

现在遇到了瓶颈期 of a wall on this Moldovan bank fraud.
你能帮我看一下这些交易 Can you take a look at these transactions,
看看能找出什么吗?

好的 当然可以 Uh, yeah, of course.
我很高兴你能找我帮忙 I'm actually really glad you asked.
我马上就去看 I'll get right on that.
谢谢 Thanks.
怎么了?

我脸上有东西吗?

没有 No.
你没事吧?

严重的妄想症和侵害型精神病 Extreme paranoia and encroaching psychosis.
没事 抱歉 Yeah.

我...

嗯哼 Mm

好的 好吧 Okay.

呃...

嗯哼 Mm

嗨 我想和管事的人谈谈 Hi.

抱歉 先生 您预约过了吗?

我没有 你只要告诉他们我是来谈谈 No, I don't, but just tell them I'm here to speak about
Andrew Epperly的NZT人体试验的 Andrew Epperly's NZT trials.
哇 你们真挺像管事的 Wow.

听着 我知道你们忙于 Now, I'm sure you're all very busy
运作Ubient医药公司 所以我有话直说了 running Ubient Pharmaceutical, so let's save us all some time.
我知道你们公司在研究NZT I know your company was researching NZT.
先生 我们从没有听说过 Sir, we have never heard
NZT是什么 of NZT.
如果真是这样 你们也不会接待我了 If that was true, I wouldn't have made it past reception.
我还知道Andrew Epperly在进行人体试验 Now, I know Andrew Epperly was conducting human trials.
Andrew Epperly不是 Andrew Epperly is not an employee
Ubient医药的员工 of Ubient Pharmaceutical.
他曾经是Ubient医药的员工 While he was an employee of Ubient Pharmaceutical.
我需要看一下他的研究 I need to see his research,
尤其是所有关于 specifically anything on
对抗NZT副作用的研究 counteracting the side effects of NZT.
我还要看一下你们所有 And I need any records you have
人体试验参与者的记录 of the trial participants, specifically
尤其是Conrad Harris Conrad Harris.
只要给我看这些 Give me those things, and I don't
我就不会向媒体披露 go to the press with this.
先生 Ubient没有任何关于叫NZT这药的人体试验 Sir, there was no trial of any drug called NZT at Ubient.
而Andrew Epperly Andrew Epperly
在这里工作时 enjoyed a tremendous degree
享有高度的自主权 of autonomy while he worked here.
我要补充的是 Which, I should add,
他不再享有了 he no longer does.
Epperly博士 Dr.

去年不幸去世了 tragically passed away last year.
抱歉 I'm sorry.
我们帮不了你 We can't help you.
你没事吧?

我想你们都已经读过了蓝队 I take it you've all read the blue team's response
对我们序幕的回应 to our opening salvo.
或者说 是Harris探员的 Or, should I say, Agent Harris'.
呃 抗议者现在 The, um, protesters are now
都反对纽约警署的24小时巡逻 up against around

还有全城宵禁 and a citywide curfew.
如果我们组织起抗议者 If we organize the protesters,
可能会更有意义 that might mean more.
当然说起来容易做起来难 但是我...

Harris探员?

抱歉 Excuse me.
你没事吧?

他们知道 Rebecca They know, Rebecca.
我刚才和那边的高层谈过了 I was in there with the top people,
他们假装自己不知道NZT是什么 and they were pretending not to know what NZT is.
他们说Epperly不在那工作 They were saying that Epperly doesn't work there anymore,
也没有任何的研究 that there never was any research,
而且现在已经死了 and he's dead now.
Brian 慢慢说 Brian, slow down.
听着 很明显他们不想有 Look, they clearly don't want anyone
任何人把Ubient和NZT联系起来 to make any association between Ubient and NZT.
我觉得他们可能对Epperly做了什么 I think they might have done something to Epperly
还有 对那些病人也做了手脚 and, who knows, maybe all of those research patients.
但是我知道研究就在那里 But I know the research is in there.
我必须回去找找看那些记录 I just got to get back inside and find the records.
你确定吗?

你说话怪怪的 You sound strange.
我没事 I'm fine.
怎么回事?

你说什么?

出...

我在这干什么?

你想见我们 You wanted to meet.
你短信上说的 Or so you texted.
我是给Morra参议员发的短信 I texted Senator Morra.
所以我们来了 So here we are.
你告诉我你还没有做我让你做的事 You were just telling me you haven't done what I asked,
就是针对Harris探员的事 regarding Agent Harris.
不 No.
不 我没有 No, I haven't.
我不能 我不能这么做 I can't.

一定还有其它的办法...

不至于毁掉她的人生 mean ruining her life.
抱歉 Excuse me.
这样只会变得更糟 It's only gonna get worse.
明后天就会变得更糟 It'll be tomorrow's pill or the next one,
可如果你继续吃药 but you keep going on like this,
用不了几天 Brian Finch就会消失 one of these days, Brian Finch is going away,
再也回不来了 and he's never coming back.
该是时候为你自己考虑了 It's time to think about you now.
Rebecca救不了你的 Brian Rebecca can't save you, Brian.
只有靠你自己 Only you can.
你昨天去哪儿了?

你突然挂断 还一整夜都不接电话 You hung up on me, you didn't answer your phone all night.
怎...

怎么了?

我昨晚过得很糟 I had a rough night.
你病了吗?

不知道 我...

或许我应该停止服用NZT了 I may need to stop taking NZT.
我帮你预约医生 I'm gonna make you a doctor's appointment.
不 不 不 不 不 No, no, no, no, no.
必须要 Yes.
一旦我见了那个医生 As soon as I get called into that doctor's office,
一切就全完了 it's game over.
一旦联邦调查局知道我不是真的对NZT免疫 The FBI is gonna know I'm not really immune.
我就得蹲大牢了 I'll go to jail.
这是什么?

Epperly没有死
我得弄清楚那个纸条是从哪来的 I have to figure out where that note came from.
如果Epperly还活着 If Epperly's alive,
他或许会有能抗副作用的酶 he might have the enzyme to reverse the side effects.
他可能还知道Rebecca的爸爸出了什么事 He might know what happened to Rebecca's dad.
看来我得来片NZT I need NZT for this.
有什么问题吗?

没有 No.
这是一片普通的NZT药片 It's regulation NZT pill.
只有服了这片药 我才能记起 This pill is the best shot I have
那个纸条是怎么来的 at remembering where this came from.
希望吃完我不会永久性精神失常 And hopefully it doesn't plunge me into permanent psychosis.
很抱歉让你经历了这一切 谢谢 So sorry you're going through this.

是Ubient公司的那个女人 That woman from Ubient.
是她写的纸条 She wrote the note.
嘿 我刚刚来找过你 Oh, hey, I was just coming to find you.
什么鬼?

你怎么了?

抱歉 伙计 我只是有点神经兮兮 Sorry, man, I'm just a little bit jumpy.
据蓝队自己的估计 By the blue team's own estimate,
我们的起义用不了多久就会被镇压下去 our uprising will be crushed within a matter of hours.
如果我们分散他们的注意呢?

你要怎么去分散 And how do you propose distracting
所有美军的注意?

对 Right.
那就启用C计划 Plan C.
在冷战期间 有谣言说联邦调查局有一份名单 During the Cold War, the FBI was rumored to keep
记录了发生危机时要逮捕人员 a list of names of people that were to be rounded up
就像这次的一样 in the event of a crisis like this.
政治家 艺术家 甚至外交官 Politicians, artists, uh, even foreign diplomats.
任何人都可能被贴上"危险份子"的标签 Anyone who could be labeled subversive.
如果我们发放一个像这样 What if we leak a list of names like this,
有无数人都在上面的名单列表?

这样一来 一半的国民都要反政府了 We could turn half the country against the government.
而且外国也会动员起来 And foreign countries would mobilize
保护他们的使臣 to protect their diplomats.
多边冲突 A multifront conflict.
Harris探员 Agent Harris,
我以后都不敢惹你了 remind me to never get on your bad side.
我永远不会承认有过这次对话 I will never admit to having this conversation.
这你得知道 You need to know that.
Andrew Epperly不久之前来找过我 Andrew Epperly came to me a while back.
他说需要一笔资金做一项 He said needed funds
可以颠覆一切的研究 for some study that would change everything.
他没有和我说详情 He didn't give me any details.
我给了他资金 I gave him the money.
也没有问任何问题 I didn't ask any questions.
那就是有关NZT的研究吗?

我们一直都不知情 直到...

直到后来第一个的实验者失踪的时候 until after the first test subject disappeared.
Andrew慌了 我们也慌了 Andrew was panicked, we panicked.
我...

Andrew也失踪了 right before Andrew disappeared.
你...

他死后大约六个月的时候 About six months after he died,
我家里收到了一封信 I got a letter at home.
没有邮戳 也没有退信地址 No postmark, no return address.
上面只是写着 "你没必要为任何事承担责任 It just said, "You're not guilty of anything.
错的是我" I am."
我觉得他伪造了自己的死亡 离开了 I think he faked his own death, disappeared,
就是为了躲避这一切 so he could get away from everything.
他知道怎么消除NZT的副作用吗?

我也不知道 I don't know.
你要是能找到Andrew的话 也许他能帮助你 If you can find Andrew, maybe he can help you.
- 祝你好运

你真的还有时间能找到 Do you really have the time to find a guy
一个不想被人找到的人吗?

我没有别的选择了!

你还可以陷害Rebecca啊 Rebecca.
要让我在你和她之间做选择的话 If it's you or her?
个人来说 我还是偏向于你 Personally, I'm a fan of you.
我要去找Epperly I'm going to find Epperly.
如果他真的还活着的话 那他就是解决一切的关键 If he's really alive, he's the key to everything.
大家都在讨论你 Word is out about you.
你的对策传到上层耳朵里面去了 Your countermeasure made it all the way up the ladder.
局长也听说了 To the director.
哇喔 我...

怎么传到他那里去的?

今年Avery局长决定回归基层 Apparently, Director Avery decided to participate
亲自参加今年的训练 in the exercise this year, return to his roots.
他在为蓝队效力 He was playing for the blue team.
我之前不知道...

我...

他直接打电话给我 Well, he called me directly,
说他很喜欢你的对策 said he loved your countermeasure
还有你的开放思维 and your ability to think outside of the box.
他想要见你 And he wants to meet you.
明天 Tomorrow.
哇 Oh, wow.
可这太突然了 我...

失陪一下 Will you excuse me just a moment?
你在哪儿?

Boyle给我发信息说你举止怪异 I got a text from Boyle that you were acting weird.
你得表现正常点才行 You have to be a little smoother.
你得去见一下Andrew Epperly You need to go see Andrew Epperly.
我这就把他的地址发给你 I'm sending you his address.
Epperly已经死了 Epperly's dead.
Brian 你今天早上为什么 Brian, why did you leave
没去看医生?

Epperly伪造了自己的死亡 Epperly faked his death.
他现在在康乃迪克州 He's in Connecticut.
他现在的名字 He's living under the name
是Daniel Kennedy Daniel Kennedy.
我们今晚就能驾车前往那里 We can drive up there tonight.
我去不了 I can't go.
我好像生病了 I'm sick or something.
好吧 我这就去接你 Okay, I'm coming to get you.
如果...

Rebecca 去找Epperly Rebecca, go to Epperly.
弄清你爸爸身上发生的事情 Find out about your dad.
让他把他知道的一切都告诉你 Ask him for anything he knows,
关于NZT的一切 everything he knows, about NZT,
关于NZT副作用的一切 everything about the side effects of NZT,
问问他有没有可以消除副作用的方法 if there's a way to reverse them.
你现在出现副作用的反应了吗?

所以你才会变成现在这样?

快去 好吗?

别挂电话 Just please stay on the phone.
我去找你 我们一起想办法解决 I'll find you, and we can figure this out.
别挂 Bri...

我是Brian 有事请留言 This is Brian, leave a message.
Rebecca啊 Rebecca.
你没事吧?

我们能推迟这次的会面吗?

实在是太突然了 It's very sudden.
Rebecca 联邦调查局局长说什么时候要见你 Rebecca, when the Director of the FBI wants to meet you,
就得什么时候见 you meet the director.
别担心 我会让Jordan帮你订火车票的 Don't worry, I'll have Jordan find you a train.
好吧 Great.
那我现在需要做的就是回家收拾东西了 I just need to go home and pack a bag then.
Brian 你在吗?

你到底在哪儿?

我是纽约CJC的Rebecca Harris探员 Yes, this is Agent Rebecca Harris from the CJC in New York.
我本该明天早上与局长见面 I'm supposed to meet with the director in the morning,
不过...

事态的发展出乎了预料 Things are not as they should be.
嘿!

实验者出现了失忆 Subjects have complained about memory loss,
严重的妄想症 extreme paranoia.
Brian很危险 Brian's not safe.
哦!

小心点啊 伙计!

Brian 他们要杀了你 Brian, they're trying to kill you.
你是谁?

我叫Rebecca Harris My name is Rebecca Harris.
如果我是你 可不会对联邦探员开枪 And if I were you, I wouldn't shoot a federal agent.
你是Conrad的女儿 You're Conrad's daughter.
你差点牺牲了 Brian We almost lost you there, Brian.
别担心 你没事的 Don't worry.

慢点 Take it slow.
发生了不少事 Been through a lot.
头撞得不轻 Hit your head pretty good,
但等到免疫剂起效就好了 but you're gonna be okay once the shot kicks in.
不 不 No, no, no, no.
Brian 没事的 Brian, it's okay.
都结束了 It's over.
我不会陷害Rebecca的 I'm not gonna frame Rebecca.
我知道 I know.
我从来没想过你会 I never thought you would.
什么?

我觉得你不会这么做的 I didn't think you'd do it.
我只是想知道你的极限在哪 I just needed to know what your limits are.
你是像Sands那样唯命是从的人 If you're somebody who just takes orders like Sands,
还是一个真正...

有种的人 character.
怎么回事?

难道这是个测试?

我差点死了 I could've died.
我不会让你死的 I would never let that happen to you.
那Rebecca呢?

她父亲服用过NZT Uh, her dad was taking NZT.
她不会释怀的 She's not gonna just let that go.
我不担心Rebecca I'm not worried about Rebecca.
我关心的是你 Brian This is about you, Brian.
我想知道你只是个循规蹈矩的职员 About whether you're just an employee
还是能够信赖的搭档 or you're somebody who can be a partner.
搭档?

你威胁我的家人 You threatened my family.
威胁我的朋友 You threatened my friends.
你看到的只是我们工作的阴暗的一面 All you've ever seen is the ugly side of what we do.
但远远不止这些的 Brian But there's so much more, Brian.
一粒大米?

一粒大米包含了人体所需的 This rice contains a complete nutritional profile.
所有营养 Everything the human body needs.
只要我们需要 It can grow in the harshest environments.
它能在最恶劣的环境生长 Places we need it the most.
只要稍加研究 这粒大米...

就可以养活全世界 could feed the entire world.
我不明白 I don't understand.
你为什么没把这些告诉别人?

如果你说的都是真的 I mean, if that's true,
为什么不向世人宣布呢?

因为人们不希望那样 Because people won't want it.
如果我宣布了这件事 I make an announcement.
议员们会把它转化成生产 Lobbyists bring it to action.
人们开始追逐和滥用转基因 People rave over GMO's and it's buried.
科学不能生硬的改变世界 Science can't change the world on its own.
而应该顺应世界的改变 The world needs to be willing to change.
这个过程需要一个领袖 And it takes leaders.
一个能够克服 Leaders who are willing
一切障碍的领袖 to chip away at the obstacles,
不管人们的非议 cut through the noise
勇往直前 and play the game.
达到目标 And win the game.
你就是那个领袖?

我想是的 I think so.
有你这样的人帮我 With people like you helping me,
我就能成功 I think so.
所以我想找一个搭档 I mean what I say about wanting a partner.
五枚NZT药片 Five NZT pills.
够有诚意的吧 Those weren't just hollow words.
要我做什么?

你想做什么都行 Whatever you want.
就当他们是自由支配基金 Think of it as discretionary funds.
这是...

我对你判断力的信任 trust in your judgment.
我需要你把关于NZT的一切如实告诉我 I need you to tell me everything you know about NZT.
它的副作用 如何阻抗药效 The side effects, how to reverse them.
这些我也不知道 I don't know of any way.
你研究过它 You studied it.
还做过实验 You ran trials.
你把它给我父亲 You gave it to my father.
还有其他病人服用 To other patients.
NZT的副作用导致他们死亡?

是那样的吗?

不是那样的 It's not like that.
确实有副作用 They were side effects, yes.
但那时候我对此一无所知 But I didn't know anything about them at the time.
NZT对他们的病情有效 And the NZT helped them, too.
我只想帮助他们 I was trying to help people.
我父亲死了 My father's dead.
我知道 I know that.
但不是NZT害死他的 But the NZT did not kill him.
那是怎么回事?

你杀了他?

你杀了所有的病人 Did you kill all the other patients
- 为了掩饰你的罪行?

你父亲 还有其他人 Your father, all of them,
他们不只是...

实验对象 test subjects.
他们是我的病人 They were my patients.
NZT和他们服用的其它药物不同 The NZT wasn't like the other stuff they'd been taking.
NZT让他们恢复如初 It gave them a chance to get back on track.
所以你发明NZT So, you invented NZT to give addicts
是想给那些瘾君子一次重来的机会?

不 NZT不是我发明的 No, I didn't invent NZT.
那时我父亲得了老年痴呆症初期 My father was in the early stages of Alzheimer's
我收到一封邮件 when I got an e

我不知道发信人是谁 I have no idea who sent it.
但信的内容 But the message
是关于一个健脑药成分的化学式 was a chemical formula for a nootropic compound.
我从来没见过这样的化学式 I had never seen anything like it.
我想它可能对我父亲的病情有帮助 And I thought it could help my father.
但我等不及食品药物局的批准了 But I couldn't wait for the FDA.
Ubient同意了?

他们不知道 They didn't know.
他们什么时候发现的?

直到有好几个病人 Ubient didn't know anything
消失不见了 about the study until several of the patients
Ubient才知道这件事 had already disappeared.
他们到底怎么了?

我不知道 I don't know.
你父亲的实验成功了 Your dad was one of the success stories.
他的病情好转了 He was doing well.
但我怀疑他把NZT给了别人 But I suspected he'd started sharing his NZT.
NZT开始在城里流通 It was popping up all over the city.
我担心他会遇到麻烦 I was worried he'd get himself into trouble.
所以不让他继续实验 So I cut him off.
NZT到处都是 So NZT was all over the city.
谁服用了?

这就是问题 That's the question.
一时之间NZT到处都是 One minute it was everywhere.
然后它就消失了 And then it started to disappear.
接着服用它的人 参加实验的人 And then the people who had it started to disappear.
包括你父亲 People from the trial.
也消失了 Your dad.
就好像...

有人在消除NZT Someone was clamping down on NZT.
是谁呢?

我不知道 I don't know.
嘿 Hey.
你没事了 You're okay.
嗯 抱歉了 Yeah, sorry about that.
昨天有点失常 I just wasn't feeling myself.
昨天你没回答我 You didn't answer me yesterday.
是NZT副作用发作了吗?

我之前也觉得是 You know, I thought I was.
但是今天我感觉很好 But I feel great today.
这可不是副作用 对吧?

抱歉 让你担心了 So, um, I'm sorry I worried you.
何止是担心 Worried is an understatement.
昨晚我去找了Andrew Epperly I went to see Andrew Epperly last night.
哦 然后呢?

他没有解药 He doesn't know of any antidote.
那你父亲呢?

他确实给过我父亲NZT He did give my dad NZT.
也给过其他病人 All the patients, actually.
但我觉得不是他害死了他们 But I don't think he killed them.
凶手另有其人 I think it was somebody else.
一个神通广大的人 Someone with resources.
我要被炒鱿鱼了 And I think I'm about to be fired.
你要见我?

是的 Yeah.
关上门 过来坐 Close the door and sit down, please.
局长办公室给我打了电话 I got a call from the director's office.
你取消了会议 You canceled your meeting.
抱歉 I'm sorry.
我...

你什么时候知道的?

关于你父亲和他的档案 About your father, the file.
原本我没想到这个方面的 You know, I couldn't put my finger on it at first.
但你的态度突然之间 But there was something about your attitude.
变了 A shift.
你还搞砸了和局长的会议 And then you blew off the meeting with the director.
你不会那么做的 除非你不想在这干下去了 You don't do that, unless you no longer want a career here.
我试着理解你为什么要这么做 So I tried to think of why you would do that.
只有一个合理的解释 And there was really only one good explanation.
NZT会给世界带来翻天覆地的变化 Rebecca NZT is going to change the entire world, Rebecca.
这个部门必须走在最前列 This division has to stay in front of it.
那你还叫我来干嘛?

事情没你想的那么简单 It's not that simple.
我父亲死后的一个月 我得到了这份工作 I got this job a month after my father died.
这其中一定有关联 You must've made the connection.
没错 Sure, I did.
我查了Conrad Harris的档案 I read the file on Conrad Harris,
发现他有一个女儿正在纽约犯罪科工作 and I saw that he had a daughter that was working Criminal
于是我调查了一下她 right here in New York, so I looked into her
她是一个没有经验 and I saw an agent who was inexperienced,
但是聪明 机智 坚韧的女孩 but smart, resourceful, tenacious.
她能帮我们调查NZT Someone who could help us with NZT.
而且她也会有这个意愿 Someone who would want to.
我本想给你看他的档案 And I planned on showing you the file.
你怎么说都行 That's easy to say now.
好吧 Okay, you're right.
你可以不相信我 You don't have to believe me.
那都取决于你 That is entirely up to you.
但没有局里的最高权限 But you need the Bureau's highest level of clearance
你是无法看到完整档案的 to read the full NZT records.
规定是这样 Legally, that is.
想要得到权限 你需要升职 And to get that kind of clearance, you need to advance.
想要升职 你必须得到上面人的关注 And to advance, you need people to notice you.
所以我把你安排进了红队 And that's why I put you on the red team.
我还帮你在局长那边打了掩护 And I covered for you with the director.
我说都是我的错 沟通不当 I told him it was a misunderstanding, my fault.
为你争取了48小时 I bought you 48 hours.
谢谢 Thank you.
昨天是Finch吗?

不是 No.
是你也不会承认吧?
