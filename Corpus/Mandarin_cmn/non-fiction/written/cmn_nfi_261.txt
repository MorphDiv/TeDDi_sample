曾经有个人 Once there was a man
想要找出地球的真实年龄 who went searching for the true age of the earth.
经过他的努力 In his struggles to discover it,
他无意间发现了一个极大的威胁 he stumbled on a grave threat.
1966年 加州 帕萨迪纳 春季的某一天 Beautiful spring day, Pasadena, California.

人们安居乐业 Business is booming, life's good.
只有一个人 Except for one man,
名叫克莱尔・彼得森的地质化学家 a geochemist named Clair Patterson,
朋友叫他派特 known as Pat.
他认为他所看到的所有人 He knows that everyone he sees
都身处于无形的威胁中 is in danger from an invisible menace.
他决心要阻止这一切 And he's determined to put a stop to it,
不计代价 no matter what the cost.
为了要说清楚彼得森的故事 You can't really tell Pat Patterson's story
必须要从很久很久以前地球诞生前说起 without going all the way back to the time long before the earth our home, was built,
那时星星刚刚产生它的物质 when the stars brought forth its substance.
铁 Iron
带来了行星的炽热内核 For the planet's molten core.
氧 Oxygen.
带来了岩石，水和空气 For the rocks and the water and the air.
碳 Carbon.
带来了钻石和生命 For diamonds.

一颗星诞生了 A star is born,
我们的星球 ours.
最初的几百万年里 一切还算顺利 For the first few million years, things ran smoothly
尘土颗粒滚雪球般的逐渐变成更大的物体 as dust grains snowballed into progressively larger objects.
直到这个物体大到一定程度 But once these objects grew massive enough
有了足够的引力 to have sufficient gravity,
它们开始相互吸引 从而轨道相交相撞 they began pulling each other into crossing orbits.
这就是我们的世界 This is how our world looked
最初的样子 when it was new.
地球表面没有地方可以幸免于难 No part of the earth's surface could survive intact
一直到现在 from that time to the present.
既然地球的幼年记录都不复存在了 So, with all its birth and early childhood records erased,
我们怎么才能确定 how could we ever hope to know with any certainty
地球的年纪 the age of our world?
这是个自古以来的迷 People have been wondering about this since antiquity.
1650年 爱尔兰大主教詹姆斯・乌舍尔 In 1650 archbishop James Ussher of Ireland
得出一个貌似正确的结论 made a calculation that seemed to settle the question.
就和当时大多数人一样 Like almost everyone else of his time and his world,
他的根据是圣经的造物论 he accepted the biblical account of creation as authoritative.
但是圣经里也没有提到具体的年代 But the Bible does not give exact years,
于是乌舍尔在旧约中寻找一个 so Ussher searched for an event in the Old Testament
与已知历史事件相吻合的时间 that corresponded to a known historical date.
他在列王记下卷中发现了 He found it in the second book of kings,
巴比伦统治者尼布甲尼撒二世死于公元前562年 the death of the Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar in 562 B.

乌舍尔将世代的先知和族长加起来 Usher added up the generations of the prophets and the Patriarchs,
旧约中的139个族谱 the 139 "Begats" of the Old Testament,
从亚当一直到尼布甲尼撒二世 between Adam and the time of Nebuchadnezzar,
他发现 and discovered
这个世界诞生于10月22号 that the world began on October 22
公元前4004年 in the year 4004 B.

下午六点 At 6:

星期六 It was a Saturday.
乌舍尔大主教制定的年表在当时的西方被奉为真理 Archbishop Ussher's chronology was taken as gospel in the Western world.
直到我们通过另一种途径了解地球的年纪 Until we turned to another book to find the age of the earth,
通过研究岩石本身的记录 the one that was written in the rocks themselves.
科罗拉多大峡谷中大多数的岩层 Most of the rock layers in the walls of the Grand Canyon
都属于沉积岩 由许多细小的颗粒堆积而成 are made of sediments, deposited as fine grains
这些沉积岩形成的时候 这里还是海洋 in a time when this part of the world was a sea.
年复一年 沉积物被不断增加的新沉积物压缩成了岩石 Over eons, the sediments were compressed into rock under the weight of succeeding layers,
最下面的就是最古老的 with the oldest ones at the bottom.
随便选一层 Pick a layer, any layer.
那个怎么样 How about that one?
很久以前 这里水并不深 Once upon a time, there must have been shallow water here.
在前寒武纪时期 Back in the Precambrian period,
大约10亿年前 about a billion years ago,
那时只有一种生物 there was only one kind of life.
这些蓝绿色的细菌忙着收获阳光 These blue

从而产生氧气 and making oxygen.
对他们来说那只是废气 For them, it was just a waste product,
但对于后来的动物 包括我们来说 but for the animals who evolved later, including us,
那是孕育生命的呼吸 it was the breath of life.
另选一层 Okay.

那个怎么样 How about that one?
这层被称为光明天使页岩 This layer is known as the bright angel shale.
形成于5.

这些足迹属于2.

你想知道地球的年纪 So you want to know the age of the earth?
只要了解形成每一层所需的时间 Just figure out how long it took to deposit each layer
不需要把族谱加起来 and then, instead of counting the "Begats,"
把这些层次加起来就够了 add up all the layers.
很简单吧 Easy, right?
还有一个问题 我们是根据观察这个过程得出的结论 Just one problem, We know from observing this process,
因为它还在持续 because it still happens today
在海洋中 在湖泊中 in oceans and lakes around the world.
沉积层的形成时间长度各不相同 That sediments can be laid down at widely different rates.
通常都是非常的缓慢 It usually happens very slowly,
大约1000年才有1英尺 say a foot of sediment per 1,000 years.
但如果发生了罕见的大洪灾 But when the's a rare catastrophic flood,
速度就会快很多 it can happen much faster,
几天就是1英尺 as much as a foot in just a few days.
许多地质学家尝试用这种方式 Many geologists tried this method
计算地球的年纪 to calculate the age of the earth.
他们勘探了大峡谷 They used the Grand Canyon
还有地球上其他的沉积层区域 and other sedimentary sequences around the planet.
但是他们的结论差异却无法统一 But their answers ranged too widely to be of much use,
差异范围从300万年到150亿年 anywhere between three million years and 15 billion.
这个方法还有其他的问题 And there were other problems with this method:
即使最下层的岩石 Even the deepest layers of rock
也不是地球上最古老的东西 are not the oldest things on earth.
因为即使岩石也不能从地球最初所受的灾难中幸存 Why?

对于太空 那又是另一个故事 In space it's another story.
地球诞生时留下了任何的纪念品吗 Are there any mementos from when the earth was born,
有可以证明真实年龄的物体吗 objects that could possibly tell us its true age?
我知道一个地方 可以找到当年太阳系形成时 I know a place where the unused bricks and mortar left over
残留的遗迹 from the creation of our solar system can be found.
它们存在于木星和火星的轨道间 It lies between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars.
这些是产生地球的原料 Here is the stuff of the newborn earth,
在冰冷的空间中飘荡 adrift in cold storage, unchanged
从未改变过 ever since that time.
100万年左右之前 A million or so years ago,
一颗大的小行星恰巧击撞了一颗较小的 a large asteroid happened to jostle a much smaller one,
将它推到一个新的轨道 sending it on a new trajectory,
它的运动轨迹在大约5万年前的一个夜晚终结 a collision course that ended one night some 50,000 years ago.
它从天空划过打破了大峡谷的平静 It must have shattered the peace of the Grand Canyon as it sailed overhead...
撞击形成这个大坑 to blast out this crater
在后来这里被称为 亚利桑那（大峡谷所在） in what would one day be known as Arizona.
这颗铁质小行星的碎片 Fragments of the iron asteroid that made this crater
完整的保留了下来 have survived intact.
如果我们知道这块铁的形成时间 If we just knew how long ago that iron was forged,
我们就能知道太阳系的年龄 we'd know the age of the solar system.
也包括地球 Including the earth.
怎么才能知道呢 But how could we know that?
挑块石头 Pick a rock.
随便一块石头 Any rock.
这个怎么样 How about that one?
这块石头中的某些原子可能具有放射性 Some atoms in this rock could be radioactive,
它们自然地发生衰变 which means they spontaneously disintegrate
从而变成其他元素 and become other elements.
铀原子首先变成钍原子 A uranium atom first becomes a thorium atom.
平均而言 耗时十几亿年 On average, it takes a few billion years.
钍很不稳定 The thorium is much more unstable.
祥善珨跺堎腔奀潔憩夔曹傖蔖 In less than a month it turns into protactinium.
珨煦笘綴 蔖衱曹傖賸む坻啋匼 A minute later, protactinium becomes something else.
衱冪徹10棒腔瞄蛌曹 The atom undergoes ten more nuclear transmutations...

珨跺恛隅腔レ埻赽 A stable atom of lead.
レ祥婬楷汜曹趙 And lead it will remain...

20岍槨衄跺操湮腔傖憩 婓撓坋爛爵 In the 20th century there was a huge effort, lasting decades,
聆講藩笱溫扞俶啋匼蛌曹傖鍚珨笱啋匼垀蚚腔奀潔綴 to measure the time it takes for each radioactive element to transmute into another element.
昜燴悝模楷珋藩跺祥恛隅啋匼腔埻赽 Physicists discovered that the atoms of each unstable element
迉曹掀薹岆箝隅腔 decay at a constant rate.

藩珨泐腔奀潔飲橈勤梓袧 keeping an absolute standard of time
不论日月星辰的变化 that does not look to the sun and the stars.
要了解地球真实的年龄 没有比测量铀原子更好的办法了 What better way to find the true age of the earth than with the uranium atom?
只要知道岩石中铀衰变成铅的比率 If you knew what fraction of the uranium in a rock had turned into lead,
就可以计算出岩石存在了多久 you could calculate how much time had passed since the rock was formed
但有个问题 But there's a problem.
形成之初的那些岩石 The rocks in the earth that were present when it was formed
都已不复存在 are no more.
或被压碎了 或被融化了 或者被重塑了 They've all been crushed, melted, remade.
有个办法可以计算出铅的最初数量 There is a way to calculate the amount of lead that was present from the beginning.
天赐的礼物 It's a gift from the heavens:
陨石 Meteorites.
这块碎片来自造成这个大坑的陨石 很理想 This one...

这块陨石中铅的含量 The amount of lead deep inside this meteorite
与地球形成时的完全一样 is exactly the same as when earth formed.
既然知道了铀衰变的固定比率 Since you know the constant rate of uranium decay,
就可以知道这块陨石的年龄 that should give you the age of the meteorite,
和地球的年龄一样 which was made at the same time as the earth.
只要测量 All you had to do was measure
陨石中的铅就行了 the amount of lead in meteorites.
很简单吧 Easy, right?
一位在芝加哥大学名叫哈理森 布朗的科学家 A scientist named Harrison Brown at the University of Chicago,
1947年首次掌握了这个方法 first understood this in 1947.
他选择了一位研究生来实际操作 克莱尔・彼得森 He chose a young graduate student, Clair Patterson, to do the work.
当时彼得森怎么也不会想到这个作业 Patterson couldn't possibly know how this assignment
会改变他的一生 would alter the course of his life...
还有这个世界 And ours.
表面上只是单纯的科学研究 What seemed like pure scientific research
结果却不简单 turned out to be so much more.
克莱尔・彼得森 爱荷华州一位邮递员的儿子 Clair Patterson, son of a letter carrier from Iowa,
天性叛逆 学校表现一般 was rebellious by nature and not very good in school.
但他却是天生的科学家 But he was a natural born scientist.
一位名叫哈里森布朗的地质学家 A geologist named Harrison Brown
交给彼得森意一项看似简单的科学作业 gave Patterson what seemed like a straightforward scientific assignment
首先 派特 First off, Pat...
你不介意我叫你派特吧 You mind if I call you Pat?
我知道你不是地质学家 Now, I know you're no geologist...
很可能还分不清长石和花岗岩 probably couldn't tell granite from feldspar...
但我听说你使用质谱仪很在行 but I hear you really know your way around a mass spectrometer, Pat
很好 结婚了吗 Good.

结了 她叫劳瑞 也是研究化学的 Yeah, Laurie.

我们曾在橡树岭一起为曼哈顿计划工作过 （原子弹项目） Uh, we worked on the Manhattan Project together,at Oak Ridge
好 很好 首先你要了解 Good.

这些被称为锆石的小晶体 There are these tiny crystals called zircons.
非常小 针尖大小 结构紧密 坚硬 Real small, size of a pinhead, tight as a drum and tough.
稳定性极高 Nothing gets in or out of 'em.
几十亿年如一日 And I'm talking for billions of years.
我们通过对包含它们的岩石年份测定 得知了它们的年份 We know how old these grains are because we've already dated the rocks they came from.
每个锆石只含有百万分之几的铀 Each little zircon has only a few parts per million
而这些铀又进一步衰变为 of uranium inside, and that uranium is decaying
更少量的铅 to even tinier amounts of lead.
只要测量出铅的含量 Now, you figure out how to measure that lead,
就能知道陨石的年代 and you'll know how to do it for a meteorite.
你能做到吗 You think you can do that, Pat?
可以 应该没问题 Yeah.

很好 如果你做到了 你就是第一个知道地球年龄的人 Good, because when you do, you'll be the first man to know the age of the earth.
你就出名了 And you'll be famous.
很简单的 And you'll see:

易如反掌 Duck soup.
当彼得森在测量锆石微粒中的微量铅时 While Patterson tried to measure the trace amounts of lead in the zircon grains
另外一位名叫乔治迪尔顿的研究生 another grad student, George Tilton,
也在测定锆石中的铀含量 was measuring the amount of uranium in the same grains.
彼得森只要对铅含量做等精度测量就可以（保持测量条件不变） All Patterson had to do was measure the amount of lead with equal accuracy
交给你了 派特 She's all yours, Pat.
测了6次 结果相同 Measured it six times.

百万分之3.

好的 乔治 谢啦 Yeah, nice going, George, thanks.
迪尔顿的结果每次都是一样的 Tilton's results were always the same.
但是彼得森测量相同微粒的铅含量的结果却差别很大 But Patterson's results on the lead content of the same grains were wildly inconsistent
没道理啊 This made no sense.
有可能是因为以前含铅实验污染了实验室吗 Could the lab have been contaminated by previous experiments with lead?
或许是自然界中 Maybe it was the naturally high amounts
高含量的铅影响了实验结果 of lead in the environment that were messing up his results.
彼得森用尽了办法清除实验室的铅 Patterson did everything he could to cleanse the lab of any lead
数月后
铅含量还是超出了100倍 There was still 100 times too much lead.
他已经花费了2年多的时间 He had been at it for more than two years.
易如反掌个鬼啊 Duck soup, my ass.
彼得森意识到他必须用酸来煮容器和工具 Patterson realized he would have to boil his containers and tools in acid
并且提纯化学原料 以进一步的降低实验室中的铅 and purify all his chemicals to further reduce the lead in his lab
不要啊 噢 我是新来的 Hey, you...

厕所在哪 Uh, where's the men's room?
见鬼 Ugh damn it.
不论彼得森怎样擦洗消毒 All of Patterson's obsessive scouring and sterilizing
都不解决问题 had still not solved the problem.
他必须从头开始设计建造他自己的实验室 He would need to design his own lab and build it from scratch.
哈里森布朗转去位于帕萨迪纳的 The opportunity arose when Harrison Brown moved
加州理工学院时 机会出现了 to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena
他邀请彼得森同行 and invited Patterson to join him.
好了 汤姆 可以了 Okay, Tom, that's enough.
我们现在可以进去了 We can move through the interlock, now.
彼得森在这个项目上已经花费了6年时间 Patterson had now been at it for six years,
坚持不懈的找到并消灭了许多对仪器 doggedly tracking down and eliminating the many sources of lead
造成影响的铅的源头 that were compromising his instruments.
他建造了世界上第一个超级洁净室 He had built the world's first ultra

他终于可以测量出岩石中铅的确切含量 He was finally able to measure how much lead was actually in the rock
岩石的年代已经确定了 One whose age had already been established.
彼得森终于可以利用这块铁陨石 Now, at last, Patterson was ready to tackle the iron meteorite
找出地球的年龄 to find the true age of the earth.
他将陨石样本带到阿贡国家实验室 He brought his meteorite specimen back to the Argonne National Laboratory...
在那里 世界上最精确的质谱仪刚刚投入使用 Where the world's most accurate mass spectrometer had just become operational
博士 就不能等到明天吗 Doc, this can't wait till tomorrow?
好了 小家伙 我们要把你气化了 Okay, little buddy, we're gonna have to vaporize you.
质谱仪利用磁场将样本中的元素分离 A mass spectrometer uses magnets to separate the elements contained in a sample
从而使得各种元素可以被量化 so that the amounts of each element can be quantified.
这就是解开地球真实年龄之谜的最后一环 This would provide the last missing piece in the puzzle of the earth's true age
现在 我要把你离子化 Now I'm gonna ionize you, yeah.
没有听上去那么可怕 Sounds worse than it is.
小伙伴们很亲密呦 What's an electron between friends?
杜绝了样本被外界的铅污染后 Having isolated the sample from any outside lead contamination,
彼得森终于可以测量样本中的铅和铀的含量了 Patterson was, at last, ready to measure the amount of lead and uranium in the sample
并且测定它形成的年代了 and calculate how many years before it had formed.
地球的真实年龄 The true age of the earth.
感谢所有做出过贡献的科学家们 Thank you to all the scientists who came before.
感谢地质学家们 Thank you, geologists.
感谢查尔斯・莱尔 （地质学家） Thank you, Charles Lyell.
感谢迈克尔・法拉第 （发现电磁感应） Thank you, Michael Faraday.
约瑟夫・汤姆森 （发现电子） J.

欧内斯特・卢瑟福（核物理之父） Ernest Rutherford.
感谢哈里森布朗 Thank you, Harrison Brown.
地球的年龄是45亿岁 The world is four and a half billion years old.
我们成功了 We did it.
妈 Mom?
妈 Mom.
彼得森想最先把这个困扰他多年的谜团与他的母亲分享 Patterson wanted his mother to be the first person to know what he had struggled
地球的真实年龄 The true age of the earth.
这项发现为他带来什么奖励吗 His reward for this discovery?
天大的麻烦 A world of trouble.
他当时并不知道 他妨碍了某些世界上最有权力的人的利益 He didn't know it, but he was on a collision course with some of the most powerful people on the planet.
对于古罗马人来说 To the ancient Romans,
雄伟的土星并不是一个地点 （也有农神的意思） the majestic ringed planet Saturn was not a real place,
也不是星球 而是天神 not a world, but a God King,
天地结合的结晶 a son of the marriage of heaven and earth,
铅神 the God of lead.
这些立柱都是罗马广场上最古老神庙的遗迹 These columns are all that remain of this oldest temple in the Roman forum
最早是在2500年前供奉农神 first consecrated to Saturn 2,500 years ago.
后来用做罗马的金库 It also served as Rome's treasury
也做过计量局 and its bureau of weights and measures.
今天是古罗马的农神节 Tonight is Saturnalia,
向农神表示敬意的12月狂欢节 the wild december holiday in Saturn's honor.
日常生活行为彻底颠倒 And everyday life will be turned upside down.
主人为奴仆服务 The masters will serve the slaves,
停止一切战争和死刑 no wars or executions will be allowed,
人们相互给予礼物 and gifts will be exchanged.
几百年后 A couple of hundred years from now,
当早年间的牧师们想要吸引更多教徒时 when the early church fathers look for a way to attract more pagans,
他们把农神节变成了圣诞节 they'll decide to turn Saturnalia into Christmas,
给这个冬季的节日赋予了新的意义 making it the latest in a long line of winter solstice holidays to be re

在农神节的夜晚这个高耸的农神神像看上去好像是这个样子 This towering statue of Saturn may have look something like this on the night of saturnalia
但是在古罗马 他还有更阴暗的一面 But in ancient Rome, this God had another, darker side.
农神是一个冷酷的愤懑的行动迟缓的食尸鬼 That other Saturn is a cold and sullen, sluggish ghoul,
动不动就乱发脾气 given to irrational bouts of rage.
她对他父亲的罪行难以言喻 He committed an unspeakable act of violence against his father,
甚至吞噬了自己的孩子 and devoured his own children.
在所有古人能用肉眼看见的行星中 Of all the planets visible to the unaided eyes of the ancients
土星的速度是最慢的 Saturn is the slowest,
这也就是古人用铅神的名字为他命名的原因 which could explain why it's named after the God of lead
不可否认的是 But there's no denying
农神性格的阴暗面 that the more negative aspects of Saturn's personality
其实反映的是古代人们对于铅中毒的认识 reflect the age

有意思的是 Funny thing about the Romans.
尽管他们知道 Even though they knew
接触铅会使人中毒 that contact with lead inevitably poisoned people,
造成不育还有发狂 rendered them sterile and drove them mad,
你猜他们是用的什么材料 what metal did they use to make the pipes
修建他们大名鼎鼎的供水管道呢 that carried the water through their legendary aqueducts?
给你个提示 I'll give you a hint.
水管这个词 The word "plumbing" comes
就是来源于拉丁文里的 铅 from the Latin word for lead, "plumbum."
他们用什么金属制造他们的浴缸呢 What metal did they use to line their famous baths?
如果葡萄酒太酸时他们怎么办呢 And how did they sweeten their wines when they were too sour?
他们的锅碗瓢盆又是什么材料呢 What did they use to line their vats and cooking pots?
部分历史学家相信 There are some historians who believe
铅的广泛使用是造成 that the widespread use of lead was a major cause
罗马帝国覆灭的主因 in the decline and fall of the Roman Empire.
为什么他们在知道铅有毒后还继续使用呢 Why did they continue to use lead long after they knew it was toxic?
因为它便宜 延展性好 制造简单 It was cheap, very malleable, easy to work with,
大量接触致命剂量的那些人 and the ones who were exposed to it at its most lethal levels...
矿工和处理铅的工人 the miners and workers who processed the lead...
都是无关紧要的 were considered expendable.
他们的性命不重要 Their lives didn't matter.
他们是奴隶 They were slaves.
地球上大部分的铅最初都是深埋在地下 与生物保持安全的距离 Most of the earth's lead started off at a safe distance from living things, down below the surface
但是大约8500年前 but about 8,500 years ago,
人们知道了如何从地里挖东西 humans began figuring out how to dig into the earth
从岩石中提炼金属 and extract metals from rock.
这个庄园新建成时 By the time this villa was new,
也就几千年前 just a couple of thousand years ago,
罗马人年产铅8万吨 the romans were producing 80,000 tons of lead a year.
为什么铅对我们的危害这么大 Why is lead so poisonous to us?
因为当铅进入我们的体内 Because when it gets into our bodies,
铅假装成其他金属 比如锌或者铁 lead mimics other metals, like zinc and iron,
细胞茁壮成长确实需要的元素 the ones our cells actually need to grow and flourish.
细胞中的酶被铅的伪装迷惑 Enzymes in the cell are fooled by the lead's masquerade,
它们开始结合 and they begin to dance.
这是致命的结合 因为铅无法满足 But it's a dance of death, because the lead is an imposter
对细胞至关重要的需要 that can't fulfill the cell's vital needs.
铅也会妨碍神经转物质 Lead also blocks neurotransmitters,
堵塞细胞间的交流网络 the communication network between the cells.
干扰对记忆和学习能力至关重要的分子的神经末梢 It interferes with the molecular receptors that are vital to memory and learning.
对孩童尤为有害 This is especially damaging to children,
没人可以避免 but lead poisoning spares no one.
从进入20世纪开始 Starting at the turn of the 20th century,
含铅油漆厂商们雇佣刚萌芽的广告业者向消费者灌输 the makers of leaded paint hired the fledgling advertising industry to persuade the consumer
铅对孩童无害的观念 that lead was child

玩具小铅兵对荷兰小孩说 A little toy lead soldier once to the Dutch boy said,
我们好多小伙伴身体里都有一点点的铅 "we have some fine relations who all contain some lead."
我们开个派对让你认识一下伟大的铅家族中其他的快乐小伙伴吧 "Why don't you give a party so folks can meet and see the other happy members of the great lead family?"
第一个到来的是快乐的电灯泡 The first one at the party was gay electric light.
他说 我非常亮 "He said, " I'm very brilliant."
我在黑夜闪闪发光 "I always shine at night."
我这么亮可不是因为我的玻璃头 "No little of my brilliance is due to my glass head,"
让光线更明亮 which gives a light much brighter
是因为我是铅做的 "because it's made with lead."
一对橡胶进来挽住荷兰小孩的手臂 A pair or rubbers entered and took the Dutch boy's arm.
他们说 我们让你保持干燥和暖和 "They said, " we are protectors who keep you dry and warm.
制造我们的人说 "You knew when we were molded, the man who made us said,"
我们坚固耐用还很活泼 we're strong and tough and lively
因为我们含有铅 "because in us, there's lead."
那是含铅产品还没有真正开始大发展 But lead production didn't really shift into high gear
直到20年代早期 until the early 1920's
化学狂人托马斯・米基利（也是氟利昂的发明人）伙同投资人 when chemist Thomas Midgley and inventor.
通用汽车的查尔斯・凯特灵 Charles Kettering of General Motors
将四乙基铅以抗爆剂为噱头添加到汽油中 found that tetraethyl lead could be marketed as an anti

他们成立了乙基公司 They formed a new company called the Ethyl Corporation.
美国陆军部曾经考虑用它做毒气 It had once been considered for use as a poison gas by the U.

和油漆中的铅不同 四乙基铅是脂溶性的 Unlike the lead in paint, tetraethyl lead was fat soluble.
皮肤接触半杯的量就会致命 A half a cup of it on your skin could kill you.
生产厂家统计销量可以达到每年6千万吨 The manufacturers calculated that they could sell 60 million tons of it a year
只有一个问题 Only problem was,
一些在特拉华州和新泽西州工厂工作的员工变得精神失常 some of the workers who processed the stuff in factories in Delaware and New Jersey were going insane
出现幻觉 跳窗而出 hallucinating, jumping out of windows.
死状恐怖 They died screaming.
这时销售宣传需要的就不仅仅是会跳舞的灯泡了 This was a selling job that would require a lot more than dancing light bulbs
他们需要一个懂科学的人 What was needed was a man of science
安抚民众的恐慌 并且提升铅的形象 to calm the public's fears and improve lead's image.
他们找到了一个合适的人选 They found the right man for the job.
那也是第一次 This was one of the first times
利用科学权威来遮掩对环境和公共健康的威胁 that the authority of science was used to cloak a threat to public health and the environment
辛辛那提的一位年轻博士 罗伯特基欧 Robert Kehoe, a young doctor from Cincinnati,
受雇与通用汽车 was hired by GM.
他对公众担心的铅的危害提出了反驳 He raised scientific doubts in the public mind about the dangers of lead
他说 铅是环境中天然存在的 Lead was naturally occurring in the environment, he said.
确实可能对第一线的工人造成职业伤害 但是 Yes, there might be occupational hazards for the people who worked with lead, but
业界自我监管就够了 that could be best handled by industry self

并没有证据表明 And there was no evidence to suggest
铅会对消费者构成威胁 that lead posed any threat to the consumer.
几十年来 没有人反驳他 For decades no one challenged him...
直到克莱尔・彼得森开始研究 Until Clair Patterson went searching
地球的年龄 for the age of the earth.
克莱尔・彼得森对地球年龄的研究 Claire Patterson's research on the age of the earth
使他成为世界上测量痕量铅领域首屈一指的专家 had made him the world's leading expert on measuring trace amounts of lead
和当时的其他人一样 And like everyone else at the time,
他猜想铅是天然普遍存在的 he assumed the prevalence of lead occurred naturally.
像他这样真正的科学家 True scientist that he was, he set out
他开始尽全力探究铅是如何在环境中传播的 to discover everything he could about how lead circulates through the environment.
依靠美国石油组织的拨款 On a grant from the American Petroleum Institute,
他仔细的测量了深层和浅层海水中的铅浓度 he carefully measured the concentrations of lead in deep and shallow seawater
彼得森又一次发现他的原始数据无法解释了 Once again, Patterson found that his initial data made no sense.
深层海水中只有极少量的铅浓度 There were only minuscule concentrations of lead in the deep ocean water
但在浅水和水面上 But in shallow waters and at the surface,
铅浓度却要高出几百倍 the concentrations of lead were hundreds of times greater.
海洋中 要用几百年浅层海水才会与深层海水相混合 In any ocean, it takes a few hundred years for the shallow waters to mix with the deep.
彼得森得出结论 表层海水中大量的铅是最近才出现的 This told Patterson that the large amount of lead in the surface waters had arrived recently.
否则它会分布的更均匀 Otherwise it would have been more evenly distributed.
知道了浅层的铅浓度以及与深层混合所需要的时间 Knowing the quantity of lead in the shallow seas and the time needed to mix it into the deeper layers
他就可以估算出表面的铅污染比率 he was able to estimate the rate of lead contamination at the surface.
彼得森问自己 Patterson asked himself
是什么能给全球的海洋带来这么多的铅 what could possibly supply lead to the world's oceans at such a rate.
这些铅都是哪里来的 Where's all that lead coming from?
我知道了 哈里森 I think I know, Harrison.
它来自含铅汽油 It's from leaded gasoline.
好吧 这个有点麻烦 派特 Well, then we've got a problem, Pat,
钱也是从那里来的 because that's the same place the money comes from.
但是彼得森没有屈服 But Patterson would not give in.
他立即着手发表学术论文 He went right to work on publishing the scientific paper
对含铅汽油做出讨伐 that would make the case against leaded gasoline.
他把论文寄给了久负盛名的科学期刊 When he sent the paper to the prestigious scientific journal
《自然》 彼得森将自己的名字放在后面 Nature, Patterson put his own name second.
他过去常常这样 帮助他的学生提高声望 He often did that with his students to advance their reputations
他一辈子都在避免出风头以及回避随之而来的好处 He made a lifelong point of shunning the limelight and the privileges that come with it
发表后仅3天 Only three days after publication...
反击开始了 the push

- 你好 彼得森博士

您的研究成果很了不起 Very impressed by your work.
您的研究成果对我们石油化工行业有很大的影响 Your work is of great interest to us in the petroleum and chemical industries
多亏了你们的赞助 Well, it wouldn't have been possible without your funding.
没错 我们还希望提供给你更多的帮助 Precisely.

正好 我还想在极地冰层中测量铅含量 Well, I've been thinking about measuring lead in polar ice
看看是不是和海洋中的结果一样 to see if it shows the same kind of pattern as the oceans.
铅 你的工作已经结束了 Lead?

是时候研究其他微量元素了 We're thinking it's time you move on to other trace elements.
其实 彼得森博士 In fact, Dr.

我们有能力资助你去无限制的研究其他方面 our ability to fund you in any other line of research is...

铅是一种神经毒素 Lead is a neurotoxin.
你们将四乙基铅从工厂运出来时 When you ship your tetraethyl lead from the factory...
在加进汽油之前 before you add it to the gasoline...
就像是运送化学武器 it's handled just like a chemical weapon.
都是有原因的 There's a reason for that.
你们觉得这些铅从排气管中排出后都去了哪里呢 Where do you suppose all that lead goes after it leaves the tailpipe
想想这会对我们和我们的后代造成什么影响 Think about what it might be doing to us and our kids.
基欧博士以及证明了这种程度的铅 在环境中就和12月的雪一样自然 Dr.

那它怎么会在深层海水中存在呢 Then why doesn't it show up in the deep water?

我给你看 let me just show you.
多谢了 Thanks for your time.
等等 你们还要把上百万吨的毒气排到我们呼吸的空气中吗 Wait, you're just gonna keep on putting millions of tons of poison into the air we breathe?
就算我的研究不能使你们停产 以后也有科学家可以做到 If my research doesn't put you out of business some future scientist will
石油行业来的赞助一夜之间消失得无影无踪 Patterson's funding from the oil industry vanished overnight
事实上 他们要让他失业 In fact, they tried to get him fired.
但是美国政府 陆军 海军 But the U.

原子能委员会 公共卫生署 the atomic energy commission, the public health service,
还有国家科学基金会 都支持他 and the National Science Foundation...

支持他的铅污染研究 supporting his research on lead pollution.
为了调查研究 从最北的格陵兰到最南的大西洋都有他的足迹 His investigations took him from Greenland in the far north to Antarctica in the far south
足迹遍布各个河流与山川 and to rivers, mountains and valleys in between.
即使面对最恶劣的条件 In even the most hostile conditions,
彼得森和他的团队协力复制了 Patterson and his team worked to replicate
无尘室的物污染环境 the immaculate environment of the clean room.

鼻子 Nose!
快擦鼻子 Wipe your nose, damn it!
你体内的铅比冰里的高1千倍 There's a thousand times more lead in you than in this ice!
你要污染整个样本吗 You want to contaminate the whole damn sample?

经过4个星期的精疲力尽的艰苦样本采集工作后 After four grueling weeks of painstaking sample collection
彼得森准备回到实验室了 Patterson was ready to go back to the lab.
和海水中一样 他发现在雪中 As with the oceans, he found that the amount of lead
几百年前的铅含量要低得多 was much lower in the snow of a few hundred years before.
不论在地球上的其他什么地方 No matter where he searched on earth,
也不管多久以前的样本 no matter how far he traveled back in time,
结果都说明一件事 the results always told the same story:
过去空气和水中天然存在的含量要低得多得多 The naturally occurring levels in the air and water in the past, were far lower.
几千年来 人们都知道 For thousands of years, lead had been known
铅会造成脑损伤 影响发育 to cause brain damage, developmental impairment,
暴力行为 甚至致命 violent behavior, and even death.
在地球年龄的研究中 In searching for the age of the earth,
彼得森无意中发现了一场空前规模的毒害污染的证据 Patterson had stumbled on the evidence for a mass poisoning on an unprecedented scale.
但是基欧和其他受雇铅工业的科学家 But Kehoe and the other scientists employed by the lead industry
劝说民众无需为此担心 persuaded the public they had nothing to worry about.
所有人都认为彼得森是个骗子
直到有个人开始关注这个问题 Until one man started to pay attention.
彼得森将他的发现公布于众 Patterson went public with his discoveries about lead in a big way
他把研究结果发表在主要的环境健康期刊上 He published his findings in a major environmental health journal
也寄给了多位政府高层 and sent copies to various government leaders,
包括一位很有影响力的参议员 including one highly influential senator.
缅因州参议员埃德蒙・马斯基 时任参议院大气与水污染委员会主席 Edmund Muskie of Maine was the chairman of the senate subcommittee on air and water pollution
1966年他主持了关于铅问题的听证会 In 1966 he held hearings on the lead question.
第一位证人 The first witness
罗伯特基欧 含铅汽油长期以来的支持者 was Dr.

你的结论是不是 从1937年到现在 Is it, uh, your conclusion that, in 1937 to the present time, there has been
普通驾驶者和交警 no increase in the amount of lead
还有加油站工作人员从大气中吸入的 taken in from the atmosphere by the average traffic policeman,
铅的数量没有增加 service station attendant, or...

根本没有证据 There is not the slightest evidence
可以证明这段时间内 that there has been a change in this picture
有任何改变 during this period of time.
完全没有 Not the slightest.
听证会召开的时间 The hearings were scheduled to take place,
特地选在彼得森在南极洲的时间 when the fiercest critic, Claire Patterson was off in Antarctica.
但是他出人意料地 But he unexpectedly appeared
在第五天出席了 on the fifth day of testimony.
看上去好像人体中铅浓度的增加 Uh, looks like there seems to be an increase in the concentration of lead in people
是与环境接触的结果 as a result of exposure to the environment.
是这样吗 Is that correct?
是的 That is correct.
至于鉴定典型性德铅含量 In identifying typical lead levels,
你用的是实地采集的测量结果吗 you use actual measurements you've taken in the field?
是的 Yes.
这些检测结果 Are these observations different
与其他证人提出的有区别吗 from the ones we've been hearing about from other witnesses?
没有 结果是相同的 No, th...

你 你的证词是说 You...

自然铅含量没有变化 是这样吗 no change in natural lead levels, is that correct?
是的 That is correct.
你确定吗 You're sure about that?
非常肯定 Absolutely.
现在人体中的含量看似很寻常 The levels we see in people today may be typical.
但绝不代表它们是天然的 But they are not by any means natural.
你认同基欧博士的数据吗 So you don't disagree with Dr.

认同 Uh, no, no.
你是说 根据相同的数据 You're saying that the same numbers
得出了不同的结论 are leading to different conclusions?
是的 Yes.
这种话 通常是 You know, this is the kind of thing
律师说的 不是科学家 we expect to hear from lawyers, not scientists.
我也是这么认为 I would agree with that, yes.
基欧博士 你好像对你的结论很有把握 You seem to be very sure of your conclusions, Dr.

因为我是目前在这个领域最有经验的 It so happens that I have more experience in this field than anyone else alive
这种含量的铅对人体有严重的长期伤害 At these levels, lead is a severe chronic insult to the human body
没有医学证据显示 铅会危害 There is no medical evidence that lead has introduced
公众健康 a danger to public health.
挖掘几百万吨有毒物质并将其 It's irresponsible to mine millions of tons
散布到环境中 是极其不负责任的 of toxic material and disperse it into the environment!
如果真的有证据 我们早就会发现了 If there was proof of harm, we would have found it.
你们以铅牟利就不会 Not if your purpose is to sell lead.
彼得森与整个行业又抗争了20年 Patterson fought the industry for another 20 years
铅才被禁止在美国消费品中使用 before lead was finally banned in U.

这位找出地球年龄的人 The man who figured out the age of the earth
同样也造就了20世纪 was also responsible for one
最伟大的公众健康问题的胜利 of the greatest public health victories of the 20th century.
短短几年间 儿童平均 In just a few years, average lead levels
血液铅含量猛降百分之75 in the blood of children plummeted by some 75%.
如今 医学界的共识是 Today, the medical consensus is unanimous...
人体内的铅含量不是无毒 只是量很少而已 there's no such thing as a nontoxic level of lead in humans, however small
现在 科学家又发出了其他环境问题的警告 Today, scientists sound the alarm on other environmental dangers
既得利益团体依然雇佣他们自己的科学家 Vested interests still hire their own scientists
混淆视听 to confuse the issue.
但是到头来 But in the end,
苍天饶过谁 nature will not be fooled.
