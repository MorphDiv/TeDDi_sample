生命支持百分之十五 Life support at fifteen percent.
好的 好的 快点 Okay...

生命支持百分之十三 Life support at thirteen percent.
生命支持百分之十二 Life support at twelve percent.
正在恢复生命支持 Restoring life support.
为什么这么对我 What was that for?
你挡路了 You were in the way.
你是谁 Who are you?

我不知道 I don't know.
你是谁 Who are you?
想不起来 I got no idea.
醒一醒 山岭巨人 Shake 'n wake, Tiny.
醒一醒 Shake 'n wake.
你是谁 Who are you?
你不记得了 对吗 You don't remember, do you?
不记得 No.
见鬼 Well, hell.
六个人了 That makes six of us.
怎么回事 What's going on?
我们刚刚醒来 跟你一样 We all woke up, just like you.
没有记忆 No memories.
不知道我们是谁 也不知道怎么来这的 No idea who we are or how we got here.
嘿 看看这个 Hey, guys, check this out.
这是什么地方 What is this place?
这是艘飞船 It's a ship.
看来我们要死在太空中了 And looks like we're dead in space.
系统已经关闭 空气正通过排气口排出 Systems were down and we were venting atmosphere.
我能让我们连上主机 I was able to get us back online
然后恢复飞船的自动修复程序 and restore the ship's auto

你怎么能做到 How'd you manage that?
我也不清楚 I don't know exactly.
我站在控制台前 它就自动浮现在我 I was standing there at the console and it just...
脑海中 came to me.
好吧 那是件好事 Well that's a good thing.
我们的记忆最终都会恢复的 对吗 It'll all come back to us eventually, right?
嗨 如果有人觉得自己穿得有点单薄 Hey, if anyone's feeling underdressed...
现在 我们得根据醒来的顺序 For now, we've named ourselves
给自己起个代号 by the order we woke up in.
我是一号 I'm One.
她是二号 She's Two.
三号 Three.
四号 Four.
五号 Five.
那么你就是六号 Which makes you Six.
见鬼 Damn it.
这里有无线对讲耳机 We've got comms.
你怎么想 So what do you think?
我们是一群在运输飞船上执行 We the crew of a transport vessel
远距离运输任务的机组人员吗 on some sort of long

这可以解释在休眠期 飞船经历了什么 Would explain what we were doing in stasis.
飞船出了问题 Ship gets into trouble.
受到了一些损伤 Takes some damage.
系统关闭 Systems shut down.
当生命支持系统到了临界值 When life support hits critical,
危险防护程序启动 然后我们自然被唤醒 hazard protocols kick in and we're automatically awakened.
不过 这没有解释失忆的问题 Wouldn't explain the memory loss, though.
搞定 Got it!
我们在运送什么 So what are we shipping?
种子 Seeds?
药物 Meds?
更好的东西 Better.
谁想要 Who wants?
- 我不这么认为

我们需要探索这里 We're going to need to check this place out.
来分组吧 Let's pair off.
三号 你和六号 一号和四号 Three, you're with Six, One with Four.
我和五号 And I'll be with Five.
我们用这些无线对讲耳机联系 好吧 We'll use these comms to keep in touch, yeah?
哇哦 Whoa.
哦 天 Oh, Lordy.
跃跃欲试 Expecting trouble?
是的 Hopin'.
你会修理它吗 Are you going to fix it?
我会试试 I'm gonna try.
我想说的是我们不知道 All I'm saying is we don't know
会滞留在这里多久 how long we're gonna be stuck here.
我们应该选一个领导者出来 It'd make sense to choose a leader,
某个能在团队里做出关键性决策的人 someone who can make key decisions for the group.
让我猜猜 某个人 你吗 Let me guess.

不 不一定是我 但可以是我 这个人得是 No, not me necessarily, but yeah.

大家都觉得最理想的人 represent everybody's best interests.
某个能在分歧上做最终决断的人 Somebody who's got final say in case of disagreements.
我不知道 这个人可以是我 那是你想建议的吗 I don't know.

不是 No.
你知地知 你知我知 如果选我的话 Just between us, if that was the case,
我会提拔一个好的副手 I could use a good second in command.
这就更像回事了 Now, this is more like it!
兄弟 我得开着它转转 I've got to take this thing for a ride, man.
我在想我知不知道该怎么驾驶它 Wonder if I know how to fly this thing.
你随意 Knock yourself out!
她说当她站在操作台前时 "它就自动浮现在脑海里" She said "it just came to her" while she was standing
但是当我站在操作台前 at that console, but I did the exact same thing,
尝试着去操作的时候 trying to figure out what buttons to push,
我脑子里什么都没有 and nothing came to me.
你怎么看这件事 How do you figure that?
你对这些事有任何看法吗 Hell, how do you figure any of this?
没办法知道我们在生命舱里待了多久 No way of knowing how long we were in those pods.
可能是几天 几个月 也可能是几年 Could've been days, months...

奇怪的是我们的记忆并没有被清除一空 Weird thing is it's not like our minds have been wiped clean.
如果我的记忆被完全清除了 我不可能知道什么是生命舱 或者年份 If they had've been, I wouldn't know what a pod was, or a year,
或者甚至不会说话 or even be able to express myself.
语言本身对于我们来说 就会是陌生的 对吗 Language, itself, would be totally alien to us, right?
你不会要推翻我的猜想吧 You're about to blow my theory here.
这边 This way.
呃 你带路吧 Uh, why don't you lead?
训练房 Training room?
或者也许是刑讯室 Or torture chamber maybe.
你确定你知道怎么用这些东西吗 You sure you know how to handle those things?
我想说"是的" I'm going to say "yes".
哈罗 小甜妞 Hello, sweetcakes.
嘿 山岭巨人 过来 我发现些东西 Hey, Tiny!

那为什么在闪红光 Why's that flashing red?
太奇怪了 That's strange.
这艘飞船的系统刚刚启动了 The ship's computer just initiated
某种安全协议 some sort of security protocol.
你好啊 Hey, there.
我是六号 我们受到了袭击 This is Six!

是谁 By who?

谁袭击了你们 Under attack by who?

我们需要帮助 有人听到吗 We need help, anybody!
收到 告诉我们地点 We heard, tell us where to go.
我可以追踪到你的无线对讲耳机 I can track your comms.
前方路口右转 Take the next right.
再下个路口左拐 Left at the next intersection!
不 我会尽量避免 No, not if I can help it.
某种安全协议被激活 Some sort of security protocol's been activated!
那就覆盖它 Well, override it.
我正在努力 I'm trying!
好了 我做到了 Okay, I did it.
大家都还好吗 Is everyone okay?
是的 是的 Yeah, yeah.
你用的时间可真够长 娃娃脸 Took you long enough, doll face.
伙计们 我们找到了食物 谁想要 Guys, we found food, who wants?
小孩 Kid.
好恶心 Gah!
确定这是食物吗 Are you sure?

差不多吧 It's close enough.
这个机器人是怎么回事 What's up with the robot?
理论上来说 她是个智能操作平台 Technically, she's an android.
她的生物合成机能 Her bio

与这艘飞船的外壳十分相近 to that of our ship's outer hull.
那太神奇了 That's fascinating.
她是个极其高效的实体 She's an extremely efficient entity.
纳米级校正器完美的修复了 Corrector nanites have almost fully restored
她的破损部分 her broken parts.
这不是什么大问题 Well that's not a problem.
我们只需把她塞进气闸里然后送入太空中 We just stick her in the airlock and space her.
没有这个必要 That won't be necessary.
我已经删除了她的安全指令 I've already deleted all of her security directives
并重建了她的基本程序 and re

对于我们而言 她不再是威胁了 She's no longer a threat to us.
而且可能颇有助益 And she could prove useful.
我们可不能把这玩意儿唤醒 Whoa, we're not waking that thing up.
诊断程序显示她和飞船的中央处理器 The diagnostic suggests she possesses some
有着类似神经链路的某种联系 sort of neural link with the ship's mainframe.
一旦她和中央处理器取得联系 她就会更快地执行 Once she's back online, she'll be able to run a more effective
修复命令 她会立即让我们变得安全 repair command, she'll have us space

如果你们有疑问的话 还可以让她回答问题 She may also have some answers for us if anybody is curious.
好吧 Okay.
启动她 Start her up.
你叫什么名字 What's your name?
我没有人称指代标记 I possess no personal designation.
好吧 还有很多问题要问你呢 Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of that going around.
你为什么攻击我们 Why did you attack us?
内存程序并无攻击记忆 I have no memory of such an attack.
重启操作抹除了她的存储数据 The reboot must've wiped her data stores.
好 那就不太方便了 Well, ain't that convenient.
哇 嘿 Woah!

我需要你建立与飞船主机的链路连接 I want you to initiate a neural link with the ship's computer.
你可以做到吗 Can you do that?
当然 Of course.
现在 我要你访问所有 Now I want you to access any and all data related
与这艘飞船成员相关的数据 to the passengers onboard this ship.
没有这样的数据 No such data exists.
有关于船员或者任务 Any information in the ship's records about its crew,
的相关信息吗 or its mission?
没有这样的数据 No such data exists.
怎么可能 How's that possible?
不 It's not.
这艘飞船上的程序高度复杂 This ship's programming is highly sophisticated.
有大量备份来提防数据丢失的情况 There are redundancies in place to guard against data loss.
肯定是有人故意删除了信息 Someone must have deliberately deleted that information.
那个人不一定是我们中的一员 It wasn't necessarily one of us.
真的 那到底是谁干的 Yeah?

这艘船很大 有很多地方可以躲藏 It's a big ship, lots of places to hide.
或许还有其他人在船上 Maybe there's someone else onboard.
但是 他们知道我们最终还是会找到他们 Although, they'd have to know we'd find them eventually
所以我想不通他们这样做的意义 so I'm not sure what would be the point.
我们甚至还不知道 We don't even know for a fact
每个人是不是真的失去了记忆 if everyone's really lost their memory.
我们中的任何一个人都有可能撒谎 Any one of us could be lying about that.
我不觉得是这样 I don't think so.
我是第一个醒来的 I was the first one to wake up,
我那时看过每个人的眼睛 I saw that moment in everyone's eyes...
我不认为有人是在假装睡着的 I don't think anyone was faking.
在那以后过了多长时间我们都觉醒了 Exactly how long were you awake before the rest of us came to?
最多几分钟吧 为什么这样问 Couple of minutes, at most.

你没办法证明 不是吗 No way of proving that, of course is there?
我们也不知道当时你在干什么 And no way for us to know what you were really up to.
你到底想说什么 What exactly are you suggesting?
我想说的是 If one of us is responsible,
你是我们当中最有嫌疑的 I would say that you are the number one suspect.
真可笑 That's ridiculous.
好吧 Yeah.
你随时也可以加入我们的谈话 You could jump in here any time you know.
我只是爱闲聊罢了 Chatty guy.
睡觉舱 Sleeping quarters.
啊 哈 Uh, ahhh.
我的神经网络让我可以随时随地连接上 My neural link allows me instant access
飞船的系统 to the system from anywhere on the ship.
手册上的指南既不是必须 Manual guidance is not only unnecessary,
效率又很低 but it's also inefficient.
好 还是稍后再担心吧 We'll, worry about that later.
现在开始 我需要你完全诊断并修复好 For now, I need you to run a full diagnostic
飞船上的系统 and restore all systems.
好吧 Alright.
不 No.
展示给我看 Show me.
好 Alright.
那是什么 What is that?
这是子空间传动装置 It's a subspace transmission.
这艘飞船正在发送呼救信号 The ship is broadcasting a distress signal.
你在做什么 What're you doing?
没什么 Nothin'.
你在做什么 What are you doing?
找东西来治一下头疼 Looking for something to treat a headache.
头痛可能是由血管畸变或者脑癌 Headaches can be caused by blood vessel abnormalities
导致的 or brain tumors.
你怎么知道的 How do you know that?
我不知道 我 I don't know.

我就是知道 I just do.
肿瘤就是一团繁殖失控的细胞 A tumor is a mass of cells that multiplies uncontrollably.
人体每秒创造两亿五千万 The human body creates twenty

新细胞 new cells every second.
而且肾脏每天会处理 And its kidneys process
一百八十公升血液 one hundred and eighty liters of blood every day.
当颈动脉被切开时 Blood will spurt up to two meters
血液可以喷溅到两米开外 when the carotid artery is severed.
这是一个非常有效的杀人方法 It's a very efficient killstroke.
啊哈 Uh

太好了 Yes!
好像飞船因陨石撞击受到了损害 It appears the ship has taken meteorite damage.
所以这就是为什么空气正从排气口排出 So that's why we were venting atmosphere.
有个福特继电器也受到了撞击 One of the forward relays was also hit,
引发的电涌损毁了多路系统 causing a power surge that damaged multiple systems.
把它们都修复好要花点时间 It will take some time to repair them all.
我们有引擎和导航吗 Do we have engines and navigation?
有 Yes.
武器呢 What about weapons?
飞船上装备的武器被毁 Ship's weapons are down.
那它就是我们接下来要考虑的头等大事 Then let's make that our next priority.
好的 Alright.
不 No.
让我看着 Show me.
怎么回事 What is that?
好像是另一艘船进入我们的扫瞄范围了 It appears another vessel has entered our scanning range.
他们的航向呢 And their course?
他们径直朝我们驶来 They're headed straight for us...
但我认为他们不是来寻求援助的 but I don't believe they intend to render assistance.
为什么不是 Why not?
因为他们刚刚发射了导弹 Because they just launched missiles.
撞击时间 六十秒 Time to impact...

撞击时间 五十秒 Time to impact...

我们能做什么 What can we do?
这艘飞船也配备有各种 The ship is also equipped with various
我能启动的防御措施 counter measures I can initiate.
要我展示给你看吗 Would you like me to show you?
赶紧做吧 Just do it!
嘿 听起来他们启动了引擎 Hey, sounds like they got the engines going.
是啊 Yeah.
基于我们当前的加速度 Based on our current acceleration,
撞击时间现在是四十秒 time to impact is now forty seconds.
我们不能逃脱吗 We can't outrun it?
我已经把引擎推到超过最大限度了 I'm already pushing the engines past maximum.
那跳转至超光速模式如何 What about a jump to FTL?
我们没时间进行必要的航行计算了 We don't have time to execute the necessary nav calculations.
还有选择吗 Options?
我可以试试进一步的规避逃逸 但是在这种速度之下 I could attempt further evasive maneuvers, but at these speeds
他们可能会因为我们的人造重力和惯性阻尼而负担过重 they may overtax our artificial gravity and inertial dampeners.
做吧 Do it.
到底怎么了 What the hell?
计算完成 Calculations complete.
跳转至超光速模式 Jumping to FTL.
嘿 Hey.
发 发生了什么 Wh

我们失重了几秒钟 We lost gravity for a few seconds there.
当恢复原状的时候 我们都摔倒了 When it came back on, we all took a tumble.
在掉落的时候你撞到了头 You hit your head on the way down.
- 我撞到了吗

你还好吗 You okay?
恩 我想还好 Yeah, I think so.
那知道是谁攻击了我们吗 或者是为什么 So any idea who attacked us, or why?
不知道 None.
可能那个机器人与这有关 Maybe the robot had something to do with it.
我无意伤害这艘船上的任何人 I have no intention of harming anyone on this ship.
哦 当然了 除了差点杀了我们所有人之外 Oh, yeah, except for the part where you nearly killed us all.
我不记得有这样的攻击 I have no memory of such an attack.
所以你不停地说 So you keep saying!
好了 冷静 Alright, calm down.
你现在是在逗我吗 Are you kidding me now?
我在几小时之前醒过来 我都不知道我是谁 I wake up a couple of hours ago, I got no idea who I am,
我到底怎么到的这里 how the hell I got here.
还差点被一个健忘的机器人杀死 Nearly get killed by the Forgetful Robot,
几乎被神秘飞船炸成碎片 almost blasted to scrag by some mysterious ship,
然后现在我们漂流进了一个无人知晓的空间里 and now we are floating in the middle of who

事实上 我们知道这是哪 Actually, we do know where.
我们在去往附近一个有人居住的星球的航线上 We're on course for a nearby inhabited world.
是吗 We are?
在我们被袭击前 Before we were attacked,
我发动了恢复程序 I initiated a recovery program
来恢复近来被删除 in order to salvage recently deleted
和重写的数据 and overwritten data.
你可以这么做吗 You can do that?
这个程序很耗费时间 The process is time

而且大部分的丢失信息都是无法还原的 and most of the lost information is irretrievable.
不管怎样 我设法抢救了一些数据 However, I have managed to salvage some data.
哪种数据 What kind of data?
这艘飞船的原始目的地 This ship's original destination,
我们会在12小时之内到达 we should be arriving in less than 12 hours.
你知道的 这些绿东西还不是那么糟 Y'know, the green ones aren't that bad.
虽然他们还是尝起来跟屎一样 只是也没那么糟啦 They still taste like shit but just not as much.
你确定你还好吗 You sure you're okay?
恩 Yeah.
还是记不起来你撞到了头吗 Still don't remember hitting your head?
记不起来 Nope.
我只记得掉了下来然后就是一片漆黑 I just remember falling and then blackness.
还 还有门 And

什么门 What door?
在一个黑暗的地方 在下边 In a dark place...

一扇大的金属门 A big metal door.
他们把它锁着 They keep it locked.
一直锁着 Always.
为什么 Why?
里面有什么 What's inside?
秘密 Secrets.
好吧 非得这样的话 Fine, be that way.
每个人都选个地方 休息一下 Everybody pick a room and get some rest.
我们会在十个小时之后降落 We'll be dropping out in ten hours.
这搞笑呢吧 You gotta be kidding me...
噢 你好 Uh, hi.
你好 Hello.
有何贵干 So what brings you by?
你觉得呢 What do you think?
我们即将进入轨道 We're about to enter orbit.
而你要到那个行星上去寻找问题的答案 You're heading down to the planet to look for answers.
所以我建议你先把裤子穿好 I suggest you wear pants.
你怎么了 What happened to you?
一晚上翻来覆去地没睡好 I roll around a lot in my sleep.
我们试着和下面的人取得联系 We tried communicating with whoever's down there
但还没有回应 but received no response.
可能是技术问题 Could be a tech issue.
可能是各种问题 Could be a lot of things.
小心点飞 Fly safe.
烦人 Damn.
这飞船有名字吗 This ship have a name?
这个是幻影掠夺者 It's a Phantom

掠夺者 Marauder.
我喜欢 Nice.
我们没有证据怀疑这里的人会对我们怀有敌意 There's no reason to assume the inhabitants will be hostile.
也没有证据说他们很友善啊 No reason to assume they won't be.
记住 我们只是来寻找答案的 Remember, we're just looking for answers.
不是过来找麻烦的 We're not here to cause trouble.
你们走过头了 That's far enough!
记得提醒我告诉那个机器人 我早就说过了 Remind me to tell that robot "I told you so".
你们是谁 Who are you?
来这儿干嘛 Why are you here?
看 我就担心会出这种问题 Yeah, I was afraid those questions might come up.
他们不是防卫队的 They're not Corporate Guard.
可能是赫罗斯加的人 They could be Hrothgar's people.
是赫罗斯加派你来的吗 Did Hrothgar send you?
也许吧 Maybe?
我们来这儿 无意伤害任何人 We didn't come here to hurt anyone.
也不想受伤害 Or get hurt.
尤其是后面那句 Especially that last part.
所以我们为什么不放下手中的武器 So why don't we just lower our weapons...
我们所有人 All of us.
你说你们的飞船遭到了攻击 You say your ship was attacked?
好吧 严格来说并不 Well, we're not exactly...
侵略者 Raiders.
无缘无故来到这里 使我们耗尽能源 Came at us out of nowhere, disabled our engines,
洗劫我们的飞船 留我们慢慢等死 looted our ship, left us for dead.
你们能活下来真是幸运 You're lucky to be alive.
是因为我们修复了生命支持系统 如果不是的话 Wouldn't be if we hadn't managed to restore life

没有导航 我们会漫无目的地四处飘荡 我们很幸运地 With nav systems down, we were flying blind, we got lucky,
在我们的远程扫瞄仪上找到你们这个落脚之地 picked up your settlement on our long

哇哦 好吧 你们可以在这里整顿 Wow, well, you're welcome to re

和自助寻找你们需要的物资 and help yourself to whatever you need.
但这之后 你们最好离开 But then you best be off.
为什么这么说 Why's that?
我们要有麻烦了 We're expecting trouble.
有一只独立的移民队 This is an independent colony.
我们在外围建起了足够多的天文探测系统提高可达性 We pull enough tarium out of the ground to get by,
但从来没有这样大的多元部队对我们产生过兴趣 but we've never been of interest to any of the big multi

直到现在 That is until now.
有人袭击过你们吗 You hit a big strike?
有一群有色金属公司的地质学家 It was a couple of Ferrous Corporation geologists.
在附近的小行星带调研 Surveying the nearby asteroid belt.
显然他们发现了主矿脉 Apparently they found the mother lode.
但如果Hab

开采的成本就太高了 it would be too expensive to extract.
他们需要一个地方安顿采矿工人 They need a place to house the miners,
种植粮食 取得新鲜水源 grow food, source fresh water.
就像这里 Some place like here?
这是一个大星球 It's a big planet.
但对他们而言还不够大 It's not big enough so far as they're concerned.
那个多元部队从不分享行星资源 The multi

这就能将外来风险 It minimizes the risk of outsiders,
和运营阻力降到最低 interfering with their operations.
当我们履行这个声明时 我们有所有权 As long we work this claim, we have legal title.
但如果我们准备离开 But if we were to leave,
或者发生一些什么意外 or if something should happen to us...
你知道会怎样的 well, you get the idea.
所以你们在拉扎族来之前有多远逃多远吧 So that's why you wanna be long gone before the Raza get here.
拉扎族是谁 The Raza?
他们是多元部队政策的强制执行人 They work as enforcers for the multi

他们收拾烂摊子 摆平麻烦 比如我们这里 They clean up loose ends, trouble spots...

他们是外星人 半人半虫 They're aliens, they're half

我听说他们身高超过七英尺 and I've heard that they're over seven feet tall,
皮肤被烧成 and they have skin that burns to the...
但事实上没人知道他们是什么 The fact is no one really knows what they are,
因为没人在遇到他们之后还能活下来 because no one's ever survived an encounter with them.
如果拉扎族真像你说的那么危险 If these Raza really are as dangerous as you say,
你们为什么不一走了之呢 why don't you just leave?
你再也找不到这种地方了 You don't get to a place like this
除非别无选择 不然不会走的 unless you've already run out of options.
其实 除了那个声明我们一无所有 Well, and this claim is all we have,
我们只能为它而战 we're going to fight for it.
你不觉得你还没到战斗的年纪吗 Aren't you a little young to be doing any fighting?
我已经足够成熟 可以保护我的朋友和家人了 I'm old enough to wanna protect my friends and family.
无意冒犯 但你看上去可不像 No offense but it doesn't seem to me like you've got
有人力和武器资源的人 the manpower or the firepower.
我们集合了最后的资金 We gathered together the last of our funds,
让我们其中一个人出去 带回来一船武器 sent out one of our people to score a shipment of arms,
事实上 就像你搬着的这些武器 the real thing, like the weapons you carry.
足以装备这里的每一个人 Enough for every man and woman on this settlement.
一船的武器 A shipment?
什么时候能运过来 When is it supposed to get here?
随时可能 Any day now.
如果能按时到的话 If it arrives in time,
我们会给拉扎族当头一棒 we'll give the Raza more than they can handle,
让重金属集团重新考虑他们的计划 make Ferrous Corp reconsider.
好吧 祝你们好运 还有谢谢这个 Well...

先生们 Gentlemen.
那个挂坠 它有什么特殊意义吗 That pendant, does it hold any special significance?
赫罗斯加留给我的 Hrothgar gave it to me before he left.
他说这象征这严酷镇压下的自由 He said it symbolized freedom in the face of oppression
而且当他的人来了以后 我们就可以 and that when his people arrived we'd be able to
凭借这个分辨彼此 因为他们也都带有这个标志 recognize them cause they too would have this mark.
谢谢 Thanks.
这样是不对的 This isn't right.
难道只有我一个人听他们说话了吗 Am I the only person who heard what they said?
一船的武器 A shipment of arms?
很明显我们应该留下来帮助他们 Obviously we were meant to help these people.
我们什么都不了解 We don't know that.
而事实上我们的货舱里装满了武器 And the fact that we have a cargo hold full of weapons,
这难道也是巧合吗 that's a coincidence?
你忘记了一个重要的细节 You're forgetting one important detail,
那些吓人的蜥蜴人正前往 the scary lizard people that are on their way
这个星球来毁灭一切 to this planet to destroy everything!
我想当他们出现的时候 你一定不想待在那儿 I'm guessing you don't wanna be there when they show up.
好吧 我承认 这听起来很可怕 Okay, I admit, that part sounded bad.
回飞船之前 我们坐下来 Let's table this discussion until
讨论一下吧 好吗 we're back on the ship, alright?
那个机器人说控制台坏了 The Android said that console was fried.
你真的知道自己在做什么吗 You really think you know what you're doing?
嗯 就好像你擅长控制 Well, it's like you with the controls,
或者说四号擅长剑术 or Four with his swords.
我呢 就是电线 电路 保险丝 For me, it's wires, circuits, fuses.
我不知道原因 反正我就是看得懂 I don't know why, but it just kinda makes sense to me.
不像其它东西 Not like all the other stuff.
其它什么东西 What other stuff?
我的大脑里能看见东西 I see things, in my head.
就像 当我睡觉时能看见梦一样 Like, while I was sleeping, I saw a dream.
噢 是吗 Oh, yeah?
当时我和弟弟在海滩散步 I was walking on the beach with my little brother.
他因迷路而在哭泣 He was crying because he'd gotten lost,
但我找到了他 我还 but I found him and I was...
把他带回了宫殿 was bringing him back to the palace.
宫殿 The palace?
那听起来是个不错的住所 That sounds like a nice place to live.
曾经是 It was.
直到他们杀害了我的父亲 然后开始追杀我 Until they murdered my father, and then came for me.
但我对他们来说太过强大 But I was too much for them.
即使我能杀死他们 我也没有这么做 And even though I could've killed them, I didn't.
我只是把他们的眼睛挖了出来 I just carved out their eyes
把他们留给我的继母 and left them for my stepmother to find.
那个婊子 The bitch.
我希望他们能带回真正的食物 I hope they're bringing back some real food.
我饿坏了 I'm starving.
你 你挖掉了他们的眼睛 You...

嗯 是梦中的我 Well, it was me in the dream,
但也不是真正的我 因为那不是我的梦 but it wasn't really me because it wasn't my dream.

帮助这些人 虽然我很怀疑 helping these people, which I doubt,
但不代表我们就要这么做 doesn't mean we're gonna do it.

我们至少可以给他们一个战斗的机会 The least we can do is give them a fighting chance.

明确地说 这正是我建议我们要做的 Which, for the record, is what I'm suggesting we do.
好吧 我们来投票吧 Alright.

好的 Fine.
我觉得我们应该留着这些武器 然后卖掉 I vote that we keep the weapons, we sell them, take what we make
从中牟利让我们活下去 然后找出到底发生了什么 to stay alive, and find out what the hell happened to us.
