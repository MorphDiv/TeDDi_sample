我以前寄宿学校里有这样的女生 Went to boarding school with girls like that.
不太合得来 We didn't get along.
Natalie的GSR测试是阴性 Natalie's negative for GSR.
不出奇 Not a surprise.
她手臂上的血迹在手腕处消失 The blood on her arms stops at her wrists.
所以她洗过手 So she washed her hands.
还是需要找到凶器 Still need to locate the weapon.
就目前情况来看 她是唯一的嫌犯 Given what we've got, she's our one and only suspect.
别这么快下结论 Not so fast...
"可爱的"Brody探员 "lovely" Agent Brody.
普通的发夹 Ordinary bobby pin.
你从哪儿找来的 Where'd you get that?
她叫Diane 运动学专业 Her name's Diane.

难不成还辅修尊巴舞么 With what, a minor in Zumba?
这是个老建筑 These buildings are ancient,
意味着门锁很容易被...

看啊 Voilà.
也就是说 派对上人人都可能是凶手 So that means anyone at the party could be our shooter.
但是Banton警官说 昨晚唯一出入联谊会的通道 But Officer Banton said the only way into the sorority house
得穿过前门 last night was through the front door
每个进出的人会都被镜头记录 and anyone who went in or out was caught on camera.

加深伤口 而且把子弹 deepening the wound and imbedding the bullet
隐藏在体内 in the tissue.
很难用镊子取出 Makes it difficult to grip with the tweezers,
所以我用手指去够 就伤到了 so I use my fingers badly.
急诊室医生多年来希望取缔这东西 E.

自从Gian Luigi Ferri大开杀戒 And ever since Gian Luigi Ferri killed nine people
在旧金山连杀九人后 更是如此 during his rampage in San Francisco.
发生于1993年7月1日 史称"101 California Street Shooting" 凶手使用的就是黑爪子弹
很多人认为他是疯子 You know, most folks thought that he was a nut,
但他说他是过量摄入谷氨酸钠的受害者 but he said he was the victim of too much monosodium glutamate.
噢 是味精让他变成这样的 Oh, the MSG made him do it.
Sebastian是阴谋理论鉴定家 Sebastian's a connoisseur of conspiracy theories.
那都不是阴谋 好吧 Well, they're not conspiracies, okay?
这叫甄别能力 They're discernments.
等我告诉你们"伪月球登陆" Just wait till I show you how the fake moon landing
和"我们找不到大脚野人"有什么关联 its in with why we haven't found Bigfoot yet.
我还发现了 I also found
微小塑料碎片 minute plastic fragments.
鉴于伤口周围没有火药残余 And given the lack of gunshot residue near the wound,
这可能来自杀手制作的 it could've come from some kind of improvised silencer
简易消声器 that the killer made.
有道理 他自己做了个消声器 Makes sense;

这样执法部门就追踪不到了 That's one less thing for law enforcement to track.
还有 他手臂上有淤青 He also has bruising on the arm.
他和袭击者打斗过 He fought with his attacker.
Blake上士是晚上9点左右被谋杀的 Chief Petty Officer Blake died around 9:

这些淤青的颜色说明 The color of those bruises tell me
他死前大概五六个小时发生过打斗 that they happened maybe five, six hours before his death.
监控录像显示 Blake晚上7点半 Got Blake on surveillance
到达联谊会 entering the sorority at 7:

他在派对前 和谁打了一架 Who did he fight with before he went to that party?
正在搜索通道门上的指纹 Running prints on the tunnel door.
现在为止 都是些轻罪 So far, only misdemeanors.
公共场所便溺 在喷泉里睡觉 Urinating in public, sleeping in fountains
偷吉祥物 and stealing mascots.
这些事情你都做过吧 Things I'm sure you're familiar with.
极优等生 平均绩点3.

都不用去上课 didn't even have to go to class.
Banton警官那儿拿到的监控录像里有线索吗 How's the surveillance from Officer Banton?
他挺喜欢你的 He sure liked you.
美味热腾腾的馅饼来了 Delicious, warm beignets.
吃饭喽 Put in your mouths,
边吃边说 掌握了什么情况 eat, speak of things you've learned.
死者 Our victim.
海军上士Blake Petty Officer First Class Blake,
海豹突击队员 驻扎在斯坦尼斯河岸训练基地 a Navy SEAL, stationed at the Stennis Riverine Facility.
就这么点 That's it?
他的任务是军事机密 Well, his missions were classified.
所以他也是个机密 So he is as well.
但是我联系了一个特种作战司令部(SOCOM)的熟人 But I did speak with a contact at SOCOM
但愿等会儿他会给我一份详细的简历 who will hopefully have a detailed bio for me soon.
海豹突击队员在大学派对上干什么 What's a Navy SEAL doing at a college party?
除了显而易见的事吗 Beyond the obvious?
派对参与者和他都没有接触 None of the attendees have a connect with him,
除了Natalie Lane other than Natalie Lane.
那个我们发现和尸体在一起的女孩 The girl we found with the body.
来自西雅图 Originally from Seattle,
NOP大二 sophomore at NOP,
成绩优异 兼职家教 dean's list and a part

大家都说她很讨人喜欢 Everyone says she's a peach.
好 想想 All right, think, ideas.
那个派对上发生了什么 What happened at that party?
很多大学生 酒精无处不在 Lots of college kids, alcohol flowing.
男孩要占她便宜 Guy tries to take advantage.
她出于自卫对他开枪 She shoots him in self

Natalie不是这么说的 Not the picture Natalie painted.
她对Blake上士只有赞扬 Nothing but praise for Petty Officer Blake.
我不确定这个消息是否有用 You know, I'm not sure if or how this is related,
但是我SOCOM的熟人说 Blake所在的排 but my contact at SOCOM said that Blake's platoon
在索马里执行任务时有过矛盾 had issues during a mission in Somalia.
所以你是说 在索马里发生过一些事 So you're saying because of some weirdness in Somalia,
导致他的战友杀了他吗 one of his own guys killed him?
不 我认为是Natalie干的 或许她跟你说话时 No, I think Natalie did it.

处于震惊当中吧 我不知道 when she talked with you.

但是她和Blake在一间反锁着的房间里 but she was in a locked room with Blake.
她洗了手 She washed her hands
而且在我们到达之前 枪就莫名消失了 and somehow that gun disappeared before we arrived?
但如果不是她干的呢 But if she didn't?
谁更有可能溜进房子 Who better to sneak into a house,
进入反锁的房间 access a locked room,
用装有黑爪子弹的手枪 shoot Blake
杀了Blake with a black talon bullets
然后在没人发现的情况下离开 and leave without anyone the wiser?
对海豹来说是小菜一碟 Piece of cake for a SEAL.
好 All right.
我去找Blake的军士长 I'll speak to Blake's master chief,
了解更多关于Blake find out more about Blake
以及索马里任务的情况 and that mission in Somalia.
King 你知道海豹很不喜欢 King, you know how SEALs don't like
别人打探他们的事情 anyone poking in their business,
尤其是NCIS especially NCIS.
我会很有礼貌的 I'll use my gentle face.
我在BUDS训练中担任Blake上士的指导员 I was Petty Office Blake's instructor during BUDS training.
基础水下爆破训练
我看着他成长为一名领袖 I watched him become a leader.
他的死不仅是对他的团队是个打击 Not only is his death a blow to the team,
对我个人也是 but to me personally.
节哀顺变 My condolences.
他家人怎么样了 How's his family?
我们就是 We're it.
他的父母原来是海军陆战队员 His parents were Marines.
911事件时 他们死在五角大楼 They died on 9/11 at the Pentagon.
他出现在联谊会上是很不合情理的 Makes no sense why he was at that party.
什么意思 Meaning?
对Blake来说 It was important to Blake
为他的队员做出表率 to set an example
是很重要的 for the men on the team.
结果他在一个大学派对上被杀 Then he's killed at a college kegger?
令我失望 Sickens me.
有什么线索么 Got any leads?
我们在调查 在索马里任务之后 We're looking into whatever happened
发生了什么事 after the mission in Somalia.
我也希望我可以告诉你 Wish I could talk to you about that.
但特种部队任务是军事机密 Spec ops missions are classified.
出发 先生们 Let's go, gentlemen!
快点 Chop chop!
跟我说说 Then read me into it.
Pride探员 我以性命担保 Agent Pride, I am sure as my life
Blake的海豹队友和他的死没有任何关系 none of Blake's SEALmates had anything to do with his death.
如果你想找人聊聊 If you need to talk to someone...
去找Max Wolf Max Wolf.
他是哪个 Which one is he?
他不在这儿 He's none of them.
我说了 不是海豹 Like I said:

我们走 快点 再快点 Let's go!

Max Wolf是个雇佣兵 Max Wolf is a mercenary
海豹突击队在索马里执行任务期间 who provided support to the SEALs
他曾经提供协助 during the mission in Somalia.
他曾被发现砍掉一个恐怖分子的手指头 He was caught trying to steal a ring from a terrorist
就因为他想偷那人的戒指 by cuttin' off his finger.
Blake制止并举报了他 Blake stopped him, reported him,
他被解雇了 and he was fired.
所以Blake举报了Wolf 使Wolf颜面扫地 So Blake reports Wolf and Wolf gets blown out.
听起来是个动机 Smells like motive to me.
闻起来是秋葵汤 Smells like gumbo to me.
Wolf现在为一个 Wolf now works for a group
名叫"影团"的组织做事 called Shade Corp.
找到他 Go find him.
我会给你们留点儿吃的 I'll save you some leftovers.
-嗨

正好赶上 Just in time.
-你觉得怎么样

好像是 孜然芹 Like, cumin?
"好像是孜然芹" "Like, cumin?"
我做错了什么 Where did I go wrong?

我不打算把它搬回家 Well, I wasn't going to send it to the house,
我想把它搬到这儿来 I was going to send it here.
这是我工作的地方 This is where I work.
也是你住的地方 And where you live.
目前是 For now.
吃你的秋葵汤吧 Eat your gumbo.
我去给你的舍监打电话 I'm gonna call your RA.
你怎么确定Wolf就在这儿 So how can you be sure Wolf is actually here?
这是雇佣兵的聚集地 It's a mercenary hangout.
我从扫黄打非组一个兄弟那儿得到消息 I got a tip from one of my buddies in Vice
Wolf在进行地下交易 that Wolf's got a side business going:
枪支 夜视镜 防弹衣 guns, night vision goggles, Kevlar...
要是有防弹衣就好了 Kevlar might've been a nice idea.

我更喜欢 I'm more into guys who know
懂得"少即是多"的男人 that less is more.

像保护腐败政府 protecting corrupt governments
为恐怖分子运送武器 moving weapons for terrorists
或者杀害海豹突击队员这样的事 or killing a Navy SEAL
并不是我的菜 don't really turn me on.
Blake 你以为我杀了他 Whoa, Blake?

-去死吧

我就不去了 I'll pass.
你们吵架是因为什么 So what was the fight all about?
索马里的任务 摩洛哥的女孩...

我们打架 是因为他特么是个伪君子 We fought 'cause he's a damn hypocrite.
海豹应该勇敢 正直 有胆识 The SEALs:

而他们的代表人物 and their poster child,
海豹的楷模 a model of what a SEAL should be...
-居然在跟妓女约会

Blake害我被解雇后 我做了一些调查 After Blake got me fired, I did some digging.
发现了他跟谁一起过夜 Found out who he spends his nights in town with.
我们打起来 是因为我挑明了他女朋友的身份 We fought 'cause I called his girlfriend what she is:
一个婊子 a whore.
这个姑娘 This girl?
就是她 That's her.
Natalie 什么的 Natalie...

俩字儿 Two words:
妓 女 Hook.

她说谎了 She lied.
她忽略了"妓女"这个事实 "Hooker" was a fact she omitted.
是啊 忽略了 Yes, omitted.
忘记了 没有提到 Forgot.

绝对没有提到 There was absolutely no speaking
关于妓女的一个字 of the hooker part at all.
所以这整个...

他们在派对上相识 Them meeting at a party?
可能也是个谎言 That was probably a lie as well.
-如果Wolf说的是实话

暂时假设他说的是实话 Let's say, for a second, he was.
Natalie是个大学生 Natalie is a college student...
用得起Wini Who can afford a Wini.
呃 是Zini Uh, a Zini.
-啥

不过你明白我想说什么 But you get the point I'm trying to make.
她是妓女 并不能给我们动机 Being a prostitute doesn't give us motive.
Wolf的不在场证明已经证实了 Wolf alibi'd out.
街道摄像头拍到他在酒吧里 Street cam caught him at a bar
就在Blake上士遇害那个时刻 at the time of Petty Officer Blake's death.
我们发现Natalie是个小姐 Since we found out Natalie was a pro,
所以我扩大了搜索范围 I widened our search.
她有个少年犯记录 She's got a juvie record
在另一个名下 Natalie Burke under another name, Natalie Burke.
还是卖淫 More prostitution?
不是 谋杀未遂 No.

她试图对她的继父开枪 She tried to shoot her stepfather.
法院认为有虐待嫌疑 Court advocate suspected abuse,
但无法证明 nothing's been proven.
不过 她懂枪 But...

好了 把她带回来 All right.

给她打电话了 没接 Tried her cell.

她今天也没去上课 She didn't show up for classes today.
等一下 我认识一个人 Hang on.

了解这些事 Knows this world.
也许能帮忙 Might be able to help.
和他聊聊 Brody Talk to him.

回联谊会 Back to the sorority?
你看起来好像不愿意 Uh, you seem reluctant
把这一切怪在Natalie身上 to want to pin all this on Natalie.
调查跟Laurel一样大的嫌疑人 Is it weird working a suspect
-是不是很奇怪

你觉得会影响我对案件的判断么 Think that's clouding my judgment in this case?
Pride Pride...
一个有着不光彩历史的姑娘 Girl with a checkered past,
对我们说谎 who lied,
洗掉了手上的枪击残余物 washed gun residue off her hands
并且和受害者一起待在反锁的屋子里 and she was in a locked room with the victim?
这些都是完美的间接证据 A veritable bulls

但是...

听我说 Brody Look, Brody...
在你的孩子还小的时候 When your kid's little,
你决定他们吃什么 穿什么 you choose what they eat, what they wear.
晚上你把他们抱到床上 亲吻他们的额头 You put 'em to bed at night and kiss their forehead
这一切都很美好 and it all is good.
然后 呼 And then, poof

一瞬间 in an instant,
他们长大了 上了大学 they grow up, they go to college...
你对一切都失去了控制 You lose control of everything.
他们在哪儿 喜欢什么 Where they are, what they're into.
想想就很可怕 一切都可能 It's just scary to think that somehow
莫名演变成阴谋和谋杀 that could go as dark as turning tricks and murder.
如果有人能发明出药丸 让孩子们永远不长大 Someone ever creates a pill to keep 'em young,
他们会赚翻天的 they'll make a mint.
...可是等那个妹子张开嘴 ...but as soon as that little chick opened her mouth,
她的口气闻起来就像我的脚底板 breath smelling like the bottom of my feet
真的 简直...

噢 看谁来了 Oh, here go the man, right here.
啥事 侦探大人 S'up, Peter Gunn?
Ross P 有线人说 Ross P.

你向孩子们非法出售枪支 you're selling illegal firearms to kids.
我不知道你说什么呢 I don't know what you talking about.
那是联邦罪名 That's a Federal offense
你干什么 老兄 What are you doing, man?
拜托 我有权利 这是我的酒吧 哥们儿 Come on, I got rights and this is my bar, man.
我没事 拜托 I got this.

你不会是想把各种罪名 You ain't got to get
都在我身上用一遍吧 LaSalle探员 all method on me now, Agent LaSalle.
要保护我线人的形象嘛 Gotta protect my confidential informant's image.
你想知道什么 What you want?
她叫Natalie Name's Natalie.
她是个站街女 你在附近见过吗 She's a working girl.

所有的白人女孩在我看来都一样 White girls all look the same to me.
Ross Ross...
你没因为谋杀未遂而进大狱的唯一原因 the only reason you're not in a cell
就是因为有我罩着你 on attempted murder charges is 'cause I own you.
好吧 Fine.
嗯 站街女 Yeah.

她有什么重要的 I mean, what's so important about her?
我们觉得她杀了一名海豹突击队员 Think she killed a Navy SEAL.
海豹突击队 Navy SEAL?
她真是个小坏姑娘哈 She is a bad little white girl, huh?
我会打听打听 I'll ask around.
只要你不再纠缠我 Long as it gets you off my back.
赶快吃点麦片补补力气吧 Better eat your Wheaties.
我还会纠缠你很长时间呢 'Cause I'm gonna be on your back for a long time.
Natalie昨晚和我在一起 Natalie stayed with me last night,
但我早上起来时 她已经走了 but when I woke up this morning, she was gone.
知道我们在哪儿能找到她么 Any idea where we can find her?
呃 她一般早上都有课 Uh, she usually has class in the morning.

当这个有钱人想要再次约会时 When rich guy tries to make another appointment,

好了 冷静 Okay, calm.
只不过 并没有砰的一声 Only there is no bam.
这个奇妙的装置消除了开枪时发出的大部分声音 This contraption cancels most of the noise from the gun.
