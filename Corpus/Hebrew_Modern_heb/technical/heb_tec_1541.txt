As discussed earlier in this chapter (see the description of the Zend module descriptor block), there are global, module, and request startup and shutdown events.
The global startup functions are called once when PHP starts up; similarly, the global shutdown functions are called once when PHP shuts down.
Please note that they 're really only called once, not when a new Apache process is being created!
