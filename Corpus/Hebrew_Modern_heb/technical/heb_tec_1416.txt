To get these functions to work, you have to compile PHP with --with-imap.
Then copy c-client / c-client.a to / usr / local / lib / libc-client.a or some other directory on your link path and copy c-client / c-client.h, c-client / imap4r1.h, c-client / rfc-882.h, c-client / mail.h and c-client / linkage.h to / usr / local / include or some other directory in your include path.
הערה:
Depending how the c-client was configured, you might also need to add --with-imap-ssl= / path / to / openssl / and / or --with-kerberos into the PHP configure line.
This extension does not define any configuration directives.
These constants are defined by this extension, and will only be available when the extension has either been compiled into PHP or dynamically loaded at runtime.
