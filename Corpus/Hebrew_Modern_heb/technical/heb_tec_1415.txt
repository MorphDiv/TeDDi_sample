Versions of GD older than gd-1.6 support gif format images, and do not support png, where versions greater than gd-1.6 support png, not gif.

These functions do not require the GD library.
In order to read and write images in jpeg format, you will need to obtain and install jpeg-6b (available at ftp: / /ftp.uu.net / graphics / jpeg /), and then recompile GD to make use of jpeg-6b.
You will also have to compile PHP with --with-jpeg-dir= / path / to / jpeg-6b.
To add support for Type 1 fonts, you can install t1lib (available at ftp: / /sunsite.unc.edu / pub / Linux / libs / graphics /), and then add --with-t1lib[=dir].
This extension does not define any configuration directives.
This extension does not define any resource types.
These constants are defined by this extension, and will only be available when the extension has either been compiled into PHP or dynamically loaded at runtime.
