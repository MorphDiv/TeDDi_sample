Cogl debugging flags to unset
Cogl Options
Show Cogl options
Cogl Tracing
CoglObject references
Debug ref counting issues for CoglObjects
Trace Texture Slicing
debug the creation of texture slices
Trace Atlas Textures
Debug texture atlas management
Trace Blend Strings
Debug CoglBlendString parsing
Trace Journal
View all the geometry passing through the journal
Trace Batching
Show how geometry is being batched in the journal
Trace matrices
Trace all matrix manipulation
Trace Misc Drawing
Trace some misc drawing operations
Trace Pango Renderer
Trace the Cogl Pango renderer
Trace CoglTexturePixmap backend
Trace the Cogl texture pixmap backend
Visualize
Outline rectangles
Add wire outlines for all rectangular geometry
Show wireframes
Add wire outlines for all geometry
Root Cause
Disable Journal batching
Disable batching of geometry in the Cogl Journal.
Disable GL Vertex Buffers
Disable use of OpenGL vertex buffer objects
Disable GL Pixel Buffers
Disable use of OpenGL pixel buffer objects
Disable software rect transform
Use the GPU to transform rectangular geometry
Cogl Specialist
Dump atlas images
Dump texture atlas changes to an image file
Disable texture atlasing
Disable use of texture atlasing
Disable sharing the texture atlas between text and images
When this is set the glyph cache will always use a separate texture for its atlas. Otherwise it will try to share the atlas with images.
Disable texturing
Disable texturing any primitives
Disable arbfp
Disable use of ARB fragment programs
Disable fixed
Disable use of the fixed function pipeline backend
Disable GLSL
Disable use of GLSL
Disable blending
Disable use of blending
Disable non-power-of-two textures
Makes Cogl think that the GL driver doesn't support NPOT textures so that it will create sliced textures or textures with waste instead.
Disable software clipping
Disables Cogl's attempts to clip some rectangles in software.
Show source
Show generated ARBfp/GLSL source code
Trace some OpenGL
Traces some select OpenGL calls
Trace offscreen support
Debug offscreen support
Disable program caches
Disable fallback caches for arbfp and glsl programs
Disable read pixel optimization
Disable optimization for reading 1px for simple scenes of opaque rectangles
Trace clipping
Logs information about how Cogl is implementing clipping
