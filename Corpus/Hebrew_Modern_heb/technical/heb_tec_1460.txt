Shmop is an easy to use set of functions that allows php to read, write, create and delete UNIX shared memory segments.
The functions will not work on windows, as it does not support shared memory.
To use shmop you will need to compile php with the --enable-shmop parameter in your configure line.
הערה:
In PHP 4.0.3, there functions were prefixed by shm rather than shmop.
