When track_vars is on, it creates some associative arrays, the most important here is: $HTTP_POST_VARS.

foreach ($HTTP_POST_VARS as $var = $value) {echo "$var = $value br \n";}









To be able to use the results of your function in an expression (such as concatenating it with other strings in the example above), you need to return the value, not echo() it.



























































Environment variables are normal global variables, so you must either declare them as global variables in your function (by using "global $DOCUMENT_ROOT;", for example) or by using the global variable array (ie, "$GLOBALS["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]".
