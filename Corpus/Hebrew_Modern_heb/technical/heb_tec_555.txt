Depending on which version of the GD library that PHP is using, when fontfile does not begin with a leading '/', '.ttf 'will be appended to the filename and the the library will attempt to search for that filename along a library-defined font path.


Angle is in degrees, with 0 degrees being left-to-right reading text (3 o'clock direction), and higher values representing a counter-clockwise rotation. (i.e., a value of 90 would result in bottom-to-top reading text).
Fontfile is the path to the TrueType font you wish to use.
Text is the text string which may include UTF-8 character sequences (of the form: #123;) to access characters in a font beyond the first 255.

?php header ("Content-type: image / gif"); $im = imagecreate (400, 30); $black = imagecolorallocate ($im, 0, 0, 0); $white = imagecolorallocate ($im, 255, 255, 255); imagettftext ($im, 20, 0, 10, 20, $white, "/ path / arial.ttf", "Testing...Omega: #937 ;"); imagegif ($im); imagedestroy ($im);?
