The field delimiter is a comma, unless you specify another delimiter with the optional third parameter.
The enclosure character is double quote, unless it is specified.
Delimiter and enclosure cannot be null and only first character is used when they are specified.
Fp must be a valid file pointer to a file successfully opened by fopen(), popen(), or fsockopen()
Length must be greater than the longest line to be found in the CSV file (allowing for trailing line-end characters).

הערה:
A blank line in a CSV file will be returned as an array comprising a single NULL field, and will not be treated as an error.
enclosure is added from PHP 4.3.0.
דוגמה 1. fgetcsv() example - Read and print entire contents of a CSV file
$row = 1; $fp = fopen ("test.csv" ,"r"); while ($data = fgetcsv ($fp, 1000, ",")) {$num = count ($data); print" p $num fields in line $row: br "; $row++; for ($c=0; $c $num; $c++) {print $data[$c]." br ";}} fclose ($fp);
