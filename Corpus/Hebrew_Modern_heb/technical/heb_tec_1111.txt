(PHP 4)
Returns information about an existing socket stream.
This function only works on sockets created by fsockopen(), pfsockopen() or network sockets returned by fopen() when opening URLs.
It does NOT work with sockets from the Socket extension.
Currently returns four entries in the result array:
timed_out (bool) - The socket timed out waiting for data
blocked (bool) - The socket was blocked
eof (bool) - Indicates EOF event
unread_bytes (int) - Number of bytes left in the socket buffer
