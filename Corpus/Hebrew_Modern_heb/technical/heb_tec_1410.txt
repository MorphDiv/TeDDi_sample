It started with the name Hyper-G and changed to Hyperwave when it was commercialised (If I remember properly it was in 1996).

The current version, 4.1, is available at www.hyperwave.com.























In order to gain the original document you will have to retrieve the plain document without the links and the list of links and reinsert them (The functions hw_pipedocument() and hw_gettext() do this for you.














Hyperwave object with name 'my_object' is mapped to 'http: / /host / my_object 'disregarding where it resides in the Hyperwave hierarchy.
An object with name 'parent / my_object' could be the child of 'my_object 'in the Hyperwave hierarchy, though in a web namespace it appears to be just the opposite and the user might get confused.



The URL http: / /host / my_object will not call any PHP script unless you tell your web server to rewrite it to e.g. 'http: / /host / php3_script / my_object' and the script 'php3_script 'evaluates the $PATH_INFO variable and retrieves the object with name 'my_object' from the Hyperwave server.



Therefore you will need at least a second rewriting rule to exclude certain URLS like all e.g. starting with http: / /host / Hyperwave.
This is basically sharing of a namespace by the web and Hyperwave server.




Therefore '/' has to be replaced by another character, e.g. '_ '. to be continued.



























An associated array with all attributes of an object.
The key is the attribute name.
If an attribute occurs more than once in an object record it will result in another indexed or associated array.
Attributes which are language depended (like the title, keyword, description) will form an associated array with the key set to the language abbreviation.





It is somewhat optimised for HTML documents but may be used for any format.
Several functions which return an array of object records do also return an associated array with statistical information about them.












Since PHP with Hyperwave support built into Apache is intended to replace the native Hyperwave solution based on Wavemaster I will assume that the Apache server will only serve as a Hyperwave web interface.


First of all you need a PHP script which evaluates the PATH_INFO variable and treats its value as the name of a Hyperwave object.

The URL http: / /your.hostname / Hyperwave / name_of_object The URL http: / /your.hostname / Hyperwave / name_of_object would than return the Hyperwave object with the name 'name_of_object'.




From the users point of view it would be more straight forward if the URL http: / /your.hostname / name_of_object would return the object.









There are still some things todo:
