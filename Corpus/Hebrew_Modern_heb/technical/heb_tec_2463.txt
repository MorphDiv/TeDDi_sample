Taking as input two full-colour, full-alpha images and two corresponding greyscale depth maps, this plug-in combines the images based on which is closer (has a lower depth map value) at each point.
Script-Fu Colour Selection
This plug-in uses the algorithm described by John Schlag, "Fast Embossing Effects on Raster Image Data" in Graphics GEMS IV (ISBN 0-12-336155-9). It takes a greyscale image to be applied as a bump map to another image and produces a nice embossing effect.
