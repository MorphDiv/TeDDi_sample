Migrating from PHP / FI 2 to PHP 3
הבא
The PHP 3.0 Apache module no longer supports Apache versions prior to 1.2.
Apache 1.2 or later is required.
echo() no longer supports a format string.
Use the printf() function instead.
In PHP / FI 2.0, an implementation side-effect caused $foo[ 0] to have the same effect as $foo.
This is not true for PHP 3.0.
Reading arrays with $array[] is no longer supported
That is, you cannot traverse an array by having a loop that does $data = $array[].
Use current() and next() instead.
Also, $array1[] = $array2 does not append the values of $array2 to $array1, but appends $array2 as the last entry of $array1.
See also multidimensional array support.
"+" is no longer overloaded as a concatenation operator for strings, instead it converts it 's arguments to numbers and performs numeric addition.
Use "." instead.
דוגמה C-11.
Migration from 2.0: concatenation for strings
echo "1" + "1";
In PHP 2.0 this would echo 11, in PHP 3.0 it would echo 2.
Instead use:
echo "1" ."1";
$a = 1; $b = 1; echo $a + $b;
This would echo 2 in both PHP 2.0 and 3.0.
$a = 1; $b = 1; echo $a.$b;
