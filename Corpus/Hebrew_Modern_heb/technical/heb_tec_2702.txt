Whether to store usage data
When the HUD executes operations it stores the execution in order to make the future results better. Some users could choose to not want this data to be stored. If that is the case they should disable this property.
The penalty given to a menu item being in an indicator
In order to have the application's menu items appear higher in the search results a slight penalty is given to the indicator menu items. This value represents the percentage of that penalty so a value of '50' is a 50% additional to the calculated distance.
Penalty for extra characters added to the search
The penalty for each extra character in the search string that does not appear in the text of a menu item.

This penalty would be applied if the user typed "fiile" when searching against the menu item "File", for example.
Penalty applied if a character is dropped
The penalty for each character dropped from the search string, as compared with the text of a menu item. This only applies to missing characters that are not at the end of the search term.

This penalty would be applied if the user typed "fle" when searching against the menu item "File", for example.
Penalty applied if a character is dropped from the end
The penalty for each missing character at the end of a search term.

This penalty would be applied if the user typed "fil" when searching against the menu item "File", for example.
Penalty applied when the characters are not the same
The penalty for each substituted character in the search term.

The penalty would be applied if the user typed "fike" when searching against the menu item "File", for example.
The highest distance value that is shown in the results
After the distances are calculated (including the indicator penalty) then all values above this max are dropped. This means that the history for those entries aren't looked up as well.
