The functions in this extension implement client access to file servers speaking the File Transfer Protocol FTP as defined in http: / /www.faqs.org / rfcs / rfc959.html.
These functions are available as part of the standard module, which is always available.
In order to use FTP functions with your PHP configuration, you should add the --enable-ftp option when installing PHP 4, and --with-ftp when using PHP 3.
This extension does not define any configuration directives.
This extension uses one resource-type, which is the link-identifier of the ftp-connection.
These constants are defined by this extension, and will only be available when the extension has either been compiled into PHP or dynamically loaded at runtime.

?php / / set up basic connection $conn_id = ftp_connect( $ftp_server); / / login with username and password $login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user_name, $ftp_user_pass); / / check connection if ((!$conn_id) | | (!$login_result)) {echo "FTP connection has failed !"; echo "Attempted to connect to $ftp_server for user $ftp_user_name"; die;} else {echo "Connected to $ftp_server, for user $ftp_user_name";} / / upload the file $upload = ftp_put($conn_id, $destination_file, $source_file, FTP_BINARY); / / check upload status if (!$upload) {echo "FTP upload has failed !";} else {echo "Uploaded $source_file to $ftp_server as $destination_file";} / / close the FTP stream ftp_close($conn_id);?
