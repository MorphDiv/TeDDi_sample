Usage: %s [OPTION] [SHELL-FORMAT]
Substitutes the values of environment variables.
Operation mode:
-v, --variables output the variables occurring in SHELL-FORMAT
Informative output:
-h, --help display this help and exit
-V, --version output version information and exit
In normal operation mode, standard input is copied to standard output,
with references to environment variables of the form $VARIABLE or ${VARIABLE}
being replaced with the corresponding values. If a SHELL-FORMAT is given,
only those environment variables that are referenced in SHELL-FORMAT are
substituted; otherwise all environment variables references occurring in
standard input are substituted.
When --variables is used, standard input is ignored, and the output consists
of the environment variables that are referenced in SHELL-FORMAT, one per line.
