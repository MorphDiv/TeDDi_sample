It started with the name Hyper-G and changed to Hyperwave when it was commercialised (If I remember properly it was in 1996).

The current version, 5.5, is available at www.hyperwave.com.











In order to activate the hwapi support in PHP you will have to install the Hyperwave SDK first and configure PHP with --with-hwapi= dir$gt;.










Passing arguments to this function differs from all the other PHP Extension but is close to the C+ + API of the HW SDK.














The integration with Apache and possible other servers is already described in the Hyperwave Modul which has been the first extension to connect a Hyperwave Server.
