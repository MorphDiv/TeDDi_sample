Reads a file and writes it to standard output.


If filename begins with "http: / /" (not case sensitive), an HTTP 1.0 connection is opened to the specified server and the text of the response is written to standard output.
Versions prior to PHP 4.0.5 do not handle HTTP redirects.
Because of this, directories must include trailing slashes.
If filename begins with "ftp: / /" (not case sensitive), an ftp connection to the specified server is opened and the requested file is written to standard output.
If the server does not support passive mode ftp, this will fail.
If filename begins with neither of these strings, the file will be opened from the filesystem and its contents written to standard output.

See also fpassthru(), file(), fopen(), include(), require(), and virtual().
