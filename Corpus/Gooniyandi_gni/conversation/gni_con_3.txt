# comments:	Citing from McGregor (1984), p. 471: "The texts are divided into tone units, indicated by slashes, and sentences, which correspond to the numbered lines." Underlining is used in the original texts for stressed syllables, this is not provided here. In glosses, white spaces are removed between stems and morphological markers, in order to get the word-to-gloss alignments which in the original texts are provided by tabs, e.g. "that -ABL" is given as "that-ABL" here. Additionally, a white space is replaced by a dot if two separate glosses refer to the same orthographic word in the Goonyiandi text, e.g. "jijakji" corresponds to "he said" coded as "he.said". Note that, unfortunately, the glosses are often incomplete in the sense that a word which has been glossed before is left unglossed when it appears again, e.g. "niyinhingi" in sentence (3). In such cases, we add an underscore "_" to the glossed line to indicate that there is a gloss missing.

<comment>	The meaning of wayarrmi is uncertain . On playing back this tape , I was informed that it meant ' arm ' ( it is not however among the terms I have elicited for ' arm ' ) . The most likely possibility ( both semantically and formally ) seems to me to be that it is a careful , or dialectal , variant of the verb warr- ' leave off , forget ' . )
