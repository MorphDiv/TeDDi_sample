# short_description:	Citing from McGregor (1984), p. 471: "This text was recorded 'on site', at a waterhole on the Fitzroy River, where the events described took place. It tells of a hunting trip the speaker had gone on with two friends a number of years previously. (If, as is likely, the place referred to in line (79) is the Fitzroy Crossing ration station, the events must have occurred sometime between end of the Second War and 1951 - v. Kolig 1981:23). This story was told by Jack Bohemia in 1982."

# comments:             Citing from McGregor (1984), p. 471: "The texts are divided into tone units, indicated by slashes, and sentences, which correspond to the numbered lines." Underlining is used in the original texts for stressed syllables, this is not provided here. In glosses, white spaces are removed between stems and morphological markers, in order to get the word-to-gloss alignments which in the original texts are provided by tabs, e.g. "this -LOC" is given as "this-LOC" here. Additionally, a white space is replaced by a dot if two separate glosses refer to the same orthographic word in the Goonyiandi text, e.g. "pakiyirri↑" corresponds to "we lay" coded as "we.lay". Note that, unfortunately, the glosses are often incomplete in the sense that a word which has been glossed before is left unglossed when it appears again, e.g. "wantajpirrayi" in sentence (8) and (9). In such cases, we add an underscore "_" to the glossed line to indicate that there is a gloss missing.
