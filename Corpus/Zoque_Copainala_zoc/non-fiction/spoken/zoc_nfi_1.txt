# comments:	Note that the glossing by Harrison includes morphological segmentation using hyphens. Unfortunately, hyphens are not used in the same manner for the orthography of the main text. It is thus not clear if the hyphens represent genuine agglutinative morphology in all cases. In most (but not all) cases white spaces in the original orthography correspond to white spaces in the glossing. theThe translation by Harrison is free, and the sentences in English do not directly correspond to the glossed sentences in the Zoque original. We here try to parallelize them as far as possible. When parts of a sentence are missing in the translation, this is marked with '_'.
