# comments:		Note that the glossing by Harrison includes morphological segmentation using hyphens. Unfortunately, hyphens are not used in the same manner for the orthography of the main text. The translation by Harrison is free, and the sentences in English do not directly correspond to the glossed sentences in the Zoque original. We here try to parallelize them as far as possible.
