Class of Printers
Direct Network Setting
The contents of your next screen is dependent on your choice in the previous screen.
If you know the details, just type them in to configure your network settings directly.
Information Retrieval by Scanning the Network
In the case of SMB, &kdeprint; will use the Samba utilities nmblookup and smbclient (which need to be installed for this to work) to retrieve the information it presents in a tree structure.
Some printers or manufacturers use other port numbers for direct TCP/IP printing.
You may need to look up which one to use.
The Settings button in the dialog lets you configure your scan, including IP addresses, ports and timeout to use.
Printer Model Selection
Driver Selection
On the next screen you will see a description of the driver selected previously.
This description is extracted from the actual &PPD; used.
For a real PostScript printer never try to install a Foomatic or Gimp-Print &PPD;, even if it is offered.
You won't be happy with it.
Instead find the original &PPD; from the manufacturer, preferably the one written for Windows NT and use it.
If you are not sure which ones to use go to:
http://www.linuxprinting.org
http://www.cups.org
Via the Other... button you are able to retrieve any &PPD; located somewhere on your available file system.
Printer Test and Finding the Right Settings
You are ready to start a test print.
Hit the Test button.
Banner Selection
Finally:
Baptizing Your New Printer
