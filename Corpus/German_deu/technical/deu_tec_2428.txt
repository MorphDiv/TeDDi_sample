Abk\xFCrzung f\xFCr A ccess C ontrol L ists (etwa Zugriffs-Kontrolllisten); ACLs werden verwendet, um den Zugriff eines bestimmten (authentifizierten) Nutzers zu pr\xFCfen.
Eine erste, grobe Unterst\xFCtzung f\xFCr ACLs ist in CUPS verf\xFCgbar; dies soll in zuk\xFCnftigen Versionen verbessert werden.
AppSocket ist ein Protokoll f\xFCr die \xDCbertragung von Druckdaten, auch h\xE4ufig als "Direct TCP/IP Printing" (Direktes Drucken \xFCber TCP/IP) bezeichnet.
Hewlett-Packard hat einige geringf\xFCgige Erweiterungen zu AppSocket hinzugef\xFCgt und vermarktet es sehr erfolgreich unter dem Markennamen "HP JetDirect"...
APSfilter wird haupts\xE4chlich im Zusammenhang mit "klassischem" Drucken unter UNIX verwendet (BSD-basiertes LPD).
Es ist ein raffiniertes Shell-Skript, verpackt in einem kompletten Filterprogramm.
In Wirklichkeit ruft APSfilter "echte Filter" auf, um die verschiedenen Aufgaben zu erledigen.
Es schickt Druckauftr\xE4ge automatisch durch diese Filter, basierend auf einer Analyse der zu druckenden Datei.
Es wurde geschrieben und wird betreut von Andreas Klemm.
Es \xE4hnelt Magicfilter und verwendet haupts\xE4chlich Ghostscript f\xFCr die Dateikonvertierung.
Einige Linux-Distributionen (wie SuSE) verwenden APSfilter, andere Magicfilter (wie Red Hat), wiederum andere enthalten beide, sodass der Nutzer das gew\xFCnschte Programm selbst ausw\xE4hlen kann (wie *BSD).
CUPS hat keine Verwendung f\xFCr APSfilter, da es eine eigene Erkennung f\xFCr Dateitypen beinhaltet (basierend auf MIME -Typen) und eigene Filter anwendet.
Das Pr\xFCfen der Identit\xE4t einer bestimmten Person (zum Beispiel durch Benutzername/Passwort oder mit Hilfe eines Zertifikates) wird oft Authentifizierung genannt.
Wenn man authentifiziert ist, kann man (oder auch nicht) Zugriff auf gew\xFCnschte Ressourcen bekommen, m\xF6glicherweise auf ACLs basierend.
W\xE4hrend eines Druckvorgangs kann ein Server oder ein Rechner zus\xE4tzliche Informationen empfangen, die vom Drucker gesendet werden (Statusmeldungen etc.), entweder auf Nachfrage oder auch nicht.
AppSocket (= HP JetDirect), CUPS und IPP unterst\xFCtzen diese Kommunikation in zwei Richtungen, LPR/LPD und BSD-basiertes Drucken tun dies nicht...
Generic term for different variants of the traditional UNIX printing method.
Its first version appeared in the early 70s on BSD UNIX and was formally described in RFC 1179 only as late as 1990.
At the time when BSD "remote" printing was first designed, printers were serially or otherwise directly connected devices to a host (with the Internet hardly consisting of more than 100 nodes!); printers used hole-punched, continuous paper, fed through by a tractor mechanism, with simple rows of ASCII text mechanically hammered on to the medium, drawn from a cardboard box beneath the table.
It came out like a zig-zag folded paper "snake".
Remote printing consisted of a neighboring host in the next room sending a file asking for printout.
How technology has changed!
Printers generally use cut-sheet media, they have built-in intelligence to compute the raster images of pages after pages that are sent to them using one of the powerful page description languages (PDL).
Many are network nodes in their own right, with CPU, RAM, a hard disk and their own Operation System, and are hooked to a net with potentially millions of users...
It is a vast proof of the flexible UNIX concept for doing things, that it made "Line Printing" reliably work even under these modern conditions.
But time has finally come now to go for something new -- the IPP.
It is strong proof of the flexibility of UNIX; that "Line Printing" works reliably, even under these modern conditions.
But time has finally come now to go for something new -- the IPP.
Abbreviation for C ommon U NIX P rinting S ystem; CUPS is the most modern UNIX and Linux printing system, also providing cross-platform print services to Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS clients.
Based on IPP, it does away with all the pitfalls of old-style BSD printing, providing authentication, encryption and ACLs, plus many more features.
At the same time it is backward-compatible enough to serve all legacy clients that are not yet up to IPP, via LPR/LPD (BSD-style).
CUPS is able to control any PostScript printer by utilizing the vendor-supplied PPD (PostScript Printer Description file), targeted originally for Microsoft Windows NT printing only.
KDE Printing is most powerful if based on CUPS.
CUPS -O-Matic was the first "Third Party" plugin for the CUPS printing software.
It is available on the Linuxprinting.org website to provide an online PPD-generating service.
Together with the companion cupsomatic Perl-Script, that needs to be installed as an additional CUPS backend, it redirects output from the native pstops filter into a chain of suitable Ghostscript filters.
Upon completion, it passes the resulting data back to a CUPS "backend" for sending to the printer.
In this way, CUPS -O-Matic enables support for any printer known to have worked previously in a "classical" Ghostscript environment.
If no native CUPS support for that printer is in sight...
CUPS -O-Matic is now replaced by the more capable PPD-O-Matic.
The Perl script cupsomatic (plus a working Perl installation on your system) is needed to make any CUPS -O-Matic (or PPD-O-Matic) generated PPD work with CUPS.
It was written by Grant Taylor, author of the Linux Printing HOWTO and Maintainer of the printer database at the Linuxprinting.org website.
Abbreviation for D isk a nd e xecution mon itor; Daemons are present on all UNIX systems to perform tasks independent of user intervention.
Readers more familiar with Microsoft Windows might want to compare daemons and the tasks they are responsible with "services".
One example of a daemon present on most legacy UNIX systems is the LPD (Line Printer Daemon); CUPS is widely seen as the successor to LPD in the UNIX world and it also operates through a daemon.
Already years ago, when Linux printing was still really difficult (only command line printing was known to most Linux users, no device specific print options were available for doing the jobs), Grant Taylor, author of the "Linux Printing HOWTO", collected most of the available information about printers, drivers and filters in his database.
With the emerging CUPS concept, extending the use of PPDs even to non-PostScript printers, he realized the potential of this database: if one puts the different datablobs (with content that could be described along the lines "Which device prints with which Ghostscript or other filter?", "How well?", and "What command line switches are available?") into PPD-compatible files, he could have all the power of CUPS on top of the traditional printer "drivers".
This has now developed into a broader concept, known as "Foomatic".
Foomatic extends the capabilities of spoolers other than CUPS (LPR/LPD, LPRng, PDQ, PPR) to a certain degree ("stealing" some concepts from CUPS).
The Linuxprinting Database is not a Linux-only stop -- people running other UNIX based OSes (like *BSD or MacOS X) will also find valuable information and software there.
This is a method that often uses TCP/IP port 9100 to connect to the printer.
It works with many modern network printers and has a few advantages over LPR/LPD, as it is faster and provides some "backchannel feedback data" from the printer to the host sending the job.
The term "printer drivers", used in the same sense as on the Microsoft Windows platform, is not entirely applicable to a Linux or UNIX platform.
A "driver" functionality is supplied on UNIX by different modular components working together.
At the core of the printer drivers are "filters".
Filters convert print files from a given input format to another format that is acceptable to the target printer.
In many cases filters may be connected to a whole filter "chain", where only the result of the last conversion is sent to the printer.
The actual transfer of the print data to the device is performed by a "backend".
Mike Sweet's company, which has contributed a few substantial software products towards the Free Software community; amongst them the initial version of Gimp-Print, the EPM software packaging tool and HTMLDOC (used by the "Linux Documentation Project" to build the PDF versions of the HOWTOs) -- but most importantly:
CUPS (the 'Common UNIX Printing System').
ESP finance themselves by selling a commercial version of CUPS, called ESP PrintPro, that includes some professional enhancements.
Encryption of confidential data is an all-important issue if you transfer it over the Internet or even within intranets.
Printing via traditional protocols is not encrypted at all -- it is very easy to tap and eavesdrop e.g. into PostScript or PCL data transfered over the wire.
Therefore, in the design of IPP, provision was made for the easy plugin of encryption mechanisms (which can be provided by the same means as the encryption standards for HTTP traffic:
SSL and TLS).
Epson inkjets are among the best supported models by Free software drivers, as the company was not necessarily as secretive about their devices and handed technical specification documents to developers.
The excellent print quality achieved by Gimp-Print on the Stylus series of printers can be attributed to this openness.
They have also contracted Easy Software Products to maintain an enhanced version of Ghostscript ("ESP GhostScript") for improved support of their printer portfolio.
The first ever printers printed ASCII data only.
To initiate a new line, or eject a page, they included special command sequences, often carrying a leading [ESC]-character.
HP evolved this concept through its series of PCL language editions until today, having now developed a full-blown Page Description Language (PDL) from these humble beginnings.
Abbreviation for E pson S tandard C odes for P rinters.
Besides PostScript and PCL, Epson's ESC/P printer language is one of the best known.
Abbreviation for E asy S oftware P roducts; the company that developed CUPS (the "Common UNIX Printing System").
A Ghostscript version that is maintained by Easy Software Products.
It includes pre-compiled Gimp-Print drivers for many inkjets (plus some other goodies).
ESP Ghostscript will produce photographic quality prints in many cases, especially with the Epson Stylus model series.
ESP Ghostscript is GPL-software.
This professional enhancement to CUPS (the "Common UNIX Printing System") is sold by the developers of CUPS complete with more than 2,300 printer drivers for several commercial UNIX platforms.
ESP PrintPro is supposed to work "out of the box" with little or no configuration for users or admins.
ESP also sell support contracts for CUPS and PrintPro.
These sales help to feed the programmers who develop the Free version of CUPS.
Filters, in general, are programs that take some input data, work on it and pass it on as their output data.
Filters may or may not change the data.
Filters in the context of printing, are programs that convert a given file (destined for printing, but not suitable in the format it is presently) into a printable format.
Sometimes whole "filter chains" have to be constructed to achieve the goal, piping the output of one filter as the input to the next.
Foomatic started out as the wrapper name for a set of different tools available from Linuxprinting.org These tools aimed to make the usage of traditional Ghostscript and other print filters easier for users and extend the filters 'capabilities by adding more command line switches or explain the driver's execution data.
Foomatic's different incarnations are CUPS -O-Matic, PPD-O-Matic, PDQ-O-Matic, LPD-O-Matic, PPR-O-Matic, MF-O-Matic and Direct-O-Matic.
All of these allow the generation of appropriate printer configuration files online, by simply selection the suitable model and suggested (or alternate) driver for that machine.
More recently, Foomatic gravitated towards becoming a "meta-spooling" system, that allows configuration of the underlying print subsystem through a unified set of commands (however, this is much more complicated than KDEPrint's GUI interface, which performs a similar task with regards to different print subsystems).
Ghostscipt is a PostScript RIP in software, originally developed by L.
Peter Deutsch.
There is always a GPL version of Ghostscript available for free usage and distribution (mostly 1 year old) while the current version is commercially sold under another license.
Ghostscript is widely used inside the Linux and UNIX world for transforming PostScript into raster data suitable for sending to non- PostScript devices.
Contrary to its name, Gimp-Print is no longer just the plugin to be used for printing from the popular Gimp program -- its codebase can also serve to be compiled into... *...a set of PPDs and associated filters that integrate seamlessly into CUPS, supporting around 130 different printer models, providing photographic output quality in many cases; *...a Gostscript filter that can be used with any other program that needs a software-RIP; *...a library that can be used by other software applications in need of rasterization functions.
Abbreviation for H ewlett- Packard; one of the first companies to distribute their own Linux printer drivers. -- More recently, the Company has released their "HPIJS" package of drivers, including source code and a Free license.
This is the first printer manufacturer to do so.
HPIJS supports most current models of HP Ink- and DeskJets.
Abbreviation for HP G raphical L anguage; a HP printer language mainly used for plotters; many CAD (Computer Aided Design) software programs output HP /GL files for printing.
A term branded by HP to describe their implementation of print data transfer to the printer via an otherwise "AppSocket" or "Direct TCP/IP Prining" named protocol.
Abbreviation for I nternet E ngineering T ask F orce; an assembly of Internet, software and hardware experts that discuss new networking technologies and very often arrive at conclusions that are regarded by many as standards. "TCP/IP" is the most famous example.
IETF standards, as well as drafts, discussions, ideas and useful tutorials, are put in writing in the famous series of "RFCs", which are available to the public and included in most Linux and BSD distributions.
Abbreviation for I nternet P rinting P rotocol; defined in a series of RFCs accepted by the IETF with status "proposed standard"; was designed by the PWG. -- IPP is a completely new design for network printing, but it utilizes a very well-known and proven method for the actual data transfer:
HTTP 1.1!
By not "re-inventing the wheel", and basing itself on an existing and robust Internet standard, IPP is able to relatively easily bolt other HTTP-compatible standard mechanisms into its framework: * Basic, Digest or Certificate authentication mechanisms; * SSL or TLS for encryption of transferred data; * LDAP for directory services (to publish data on printers, device-options, drivers, costs or also to the network; or to check for passwords while performing authentication).
The new printing functionality of KDE since version 2.2 consists of several modules that translate the features and settings of different available print subsystems (CUPS, BSD-style LPR/LPD, RLPR...) into nice KDE desktop GUI windows and dialogs to ease their usage.
Most important for day-to-day usage is "kprinter", the new GUI print command. -- Note:
KDEPrint does not implement its own spooling mechanism or its own PostScript processing; for this it relies on the selected print subsystem -- however it does add some functionality of its own on top of this foundation...
...is the name of the reference document that describes KDEPrint functions to users and administrators.
You can load it into Konqueror by typing "help:/kdeprint" into the address field.
The KDEPrint website is the resource for updates to this documentation, as well as PDF versions suitable for printing it.
It is authored and maintained by Kurt Pfeifle.
kprinter is the new powerful print utility that is natively used by all KDE applications.
Contrary to some common misconceptions, kprinter is not a CUPS -only tool, but supports different print subsystems.
You can even switch to a different print subsystem "on the fly", in between two jobs, without re-configuration.
Of course, due to the powerful features of CUPS, kprinter is best suited for use with a CUPS frontend. kprinter is the successor to "qtcups", which is no longer being actively maintained.
It has inherited all the best features of qtcups and added several new ones.
MOST IMPORTANT: you can use kprinter with all its features in all non- KDE applications that allow a customized print command, like gv, Acrobat Reader, Netscape, Mozilla, Galeon, StarOffice, OpenOffice and all GNOME programs. kprinter can act as a "standalone" utility, started from an X-Terminal or a "Mini-CLI" to print many different files, from different directories, with different formats, in one job and simultaneously, without the need to first open the files in the applications! (File formats supported this way are PostScript, PDF, International and ASCII Text, as well as many different popular graphic formats, such as PNG, TIFF, JPEG, PNM, Sun RASTER, etc.)
was one of the first companies to distribute their own Linux printer drivers for some of their models.
However, those drivers are binary only (no source code available), and therefore cannot be used to integrate into other Free printing software projects.
Linuxprinting.org = not just for Linux; all UNIX -like OS-es, like *BSD and commercial Unices may find useful printing information on this site.
This web site is the home for the interesting Foomatic project, that strives to develop the "Meta Print Spool and Driver Configuration Toolset" (being able to configure, through one common interface, different print subsystems and their required drivers) with the ability to transfer all queues, printers and configuration files seamlessly to another spooler without new configuration effort. -- Also, they maintain the Printing Database; a collection of driver and device information that enables everybody to find the most current information about printer models, and also generate online the configuration files for any spooler/driver/device combo known to work with one of the common Linux or UNIX print subsystems.
....Database containing printers and drivers that are suitable for them... ...a lot of information and documentation to be found... ...it is now also providing some tools and utilities for easing the integration of those drivers into a given system... ...the "Foomatic" family of utilities; being the toolset to make use of the database for most of the commonly used print subsystems, for generating "on the fly" working configurations for your printer model.
LPR == some people translate L ine P rinting R equest, others:
L ine P rinter R emote.
Similarly to the APSfilter program, Magicfilter provides automatic file type recognition functions and, base on that, automatic file conversion to a printable format, depending on the target printer.
Abbreviation for M ultipurpose (or Multimedia) I nternet M ail E xtensions; MIME -Types were first used to allow the transport of binary data (like mail attachments containing graphics) over mail connections that were normally only transmitting ASCII characters: the data had to be encoded into an ASCII representation.
Later this concept was extended to describe a data format in a platform independent, but at the same time non-ambiguous, way.
From Windows everybody knows the .doc extensions for Microsoft Word files.
This is handled ambiguously on the Windows platform: .doc extensions are also used for simple text files or for Adobe Framemaker files.
And if a real Word file is renamed with a different extension, it can no longer be opened by the program.
MIME typed files carry a recognition string with them, describing their file format based on main_category/sub_category.
Inside IPP, print files are also described using the MIME type scheme.
MIME types are registered with the IANA (Internet Assigning Numbers Association) to keep them unambiguous.
CUPS has some MIME types of its own registered, like application/vnd.cups-raster (for the CUPS -internal raster image format).
Abbreviation for P rinter C ontrol L anguage; developed by HP.
PCL started off in version 1 as a simple command set for ASCII printing; now, in its versions PCL6 and PCL-X, it is capable of printing graphics and color -- but outside the Microsoft Windows realm and HP-UX (HP 's own brand of UNIX), it is not commonly used...
Abbreviation for P age D escription L anguage; PDLs describe, in an abstract way, the graphical representation of a page. - Before it is actually transferred into toner or ink layed down on to paper, a PDL needs to be "interpreted" first.
In UNIX, the most important PDL is PostScript.
Abbreviation for Pic ture El ement; this term describes the smallest part of a raster picture (either as printed on paper or as displayed on a monitor by cathode rays or LCD elements).
As any graphical or image representation on those types of output devices is composed of pixels, the values of "ppi" (pixel per inch) and dpi (dots per inch) are one important parameter for the overall quality and resolution of an image.
Abbreviation for P rint J ob L anguage; developed by HP to control and influence default and per-job settings of a printer.
It may not only be used for HP 's own (PCL-)printers; also many PostScript and other printers understand PJL commands sent to them inside a print job, or in a separate signal.
PostScript (often shortened to "PS") is the de-facto standard in the UNIX world for printing files.
It was developed by Adobe and licensed to printer manufacturers and software companies.
As the PostScript specifications were published by Adobe, there are also "Third Party" implementations of PostScript generating and PostScript interpreting software available (one of the best-known in the Free software world being Ghostscript, a powerful PS-interpreter).
Abbreviation for P ostScript P rinter D escription; PPDs are ASCII files storing all information about the special capabilities of a printer, plus definitions of the (PostScript- or PJL-) commands to call on a certain capability (like print duplexing).
As the explanation of the acronym reveals, PPDs were originally only used for PostScript printers.
CUPS has extended the PPD concept to all types of printers.
PPDs for PostScript printers are provided by the printer vendors.
They can be used with CUPS and KDEPrint to have access to the full features of any PostScript printer.
The KDEPrint Team recommends using a PPD originally intended for use with Microsoft Windows NT.
PPDs for non-PostScript printers need a companion "filter" to process the PostScript print files into a format digestible for the non-PostScript target device.
Those PPD/filter combos are not (yet) available from the vendors.
After the initiative by the CUPS developers to utilize PPDs, the Free Software community was creative enough to quickly come up with support for most of the currently used printer models, through PPDs and classical Ghostscript filters.
But note: the printout quality varies from "hi-quality photographic output" (using Gimp-Print with most Epson inkjets) to "hardly readable" (using Foomatic-enabled Ghostscript filters for models rated as "paperweight" in the Linuxprinting.org database).
PPD-O-Matic is a set of Perl scripts that run on the Linuxprinting.org web server and can be used online to generate PPDs for any printer that is known to print with Ghostscript.
These PPDs can be hooked up to CUPS /KDEPrint, as well as used inside PPD-aware applications like StarOffice to determine all different parameters of your printjobs.
It is now recommended, in most cases, to use "PPD-O-Matic" instead of the older CUPS -O-Matic.
To generate a PPD, go to the printer database, select your printer model, follow the link to show the available Ghostscript filters for that printer, select one, click "generate" and finally save the file to your local system.
Be sure to read the instructions.
Make sure that your local system does indeed have Ghostscript and the filter, which you chose before generating the PPD, installed.
In BSD-style print systems, the "printcap" file holds the configuration information; the printing daemon reads this file to determine which printers are available, what filters are to be user for each, where the spooling directory is located, if there are banner pages to be used, and so on...
Some applications also depend on read access to the printcap file, to obtain the names of available printers.
Abbreviation for Printer - M anagement I nformation B ase; the Printer-MIB defines a set of parameters that are to be stored inside the printer for access through the network.
This is useful if many (in some cases, literally thousands) network printers are managed centrally with the help of SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).
Abbreviation for P rinter W orking G roup; the PWG is a loose grouping of representatives of the printer industry that has, in the past years, developed different standards in relation to nework printing.
These were later accepted by the IETF as RFC standards, like the "Printer-MIB" and the IPP.
You can use a syntax of "print: /..." to get quick access to KDEPrint resources.
Typing "print:/manager" as a Konqueror URL address gives administrative access to KDEPrint.
Konqueror uses KDE 's famous "KParts" technology to achieve that.
.
Qt CUPS and KUPS were the predecessors of KDEPrint; they are now deprecated and no longer maintained.
What was good in qtcups is all inherited by "kprinter", the new KDE print dialog (which is much improved over qtcups); what you liked about kups is now all in the KDEPrint Manager (accessible via the KDE Control Center or via the URL "print:/manager" from Konqueror) -- with more functionality and less bugs...
Its former developer, Michael Goffioul, is now the developer of KDEPrint -- a very nice and productive guy and quick bug fixer...
Every picture on a physical medium is composed of a pattern of discrete dots in different colors and (maybe) sizes.
This is called a "raster image".
This is as opposed to a "vector image" where the graphic is described in terms of continuous curves, shades, forms and filled areas, represented by mathematical formula.
Vector images normally have a smaller file size and may be scaled in size without any loss of information and quality --- but they cannot be output directly, but always have to be "rendered" or "rasterized" first to the given resolution that the output device is capable of...
The rasterization is done by a Raster Image Processor (RIP, often the Ghostscript software) or some other filtering instance.
Abbreviation for R aster I mage P rocess(or); if used in the context of printing, "RIP" means a hardware or software instance that converts PostScript (or other print formats that are represented in one of the non-Raster PDLs) into a raster image format in such a way that it is acceptable for the "marking engine" of the printer.
PostScript printers contain their own PostScript-RIPs.
A RIP may or may not be located inside a printer.
For many UNIX systems, Ghostscript is the package that provides a "RIP in software", running on the host computer, and pre-digesting the PostScript or other data to become ready to be sent to the printing device (hence you may perceive a "grain of truth" in the slogan "Ghostscript turns your printer into a PostScript machine", which of course is not correct in the true sense of the meaning).
Abbreviation for R emote L ine P rinting R equest; this is a BSD-style printing system, that needs no root priviledges to be installed, and no "printcap" to work: all parameters may be specified on the command line.
RLPR comes in handy for many laptop users who are working in frequently changing environments.
This is because it may be installed concurrently with every other printing sub system, and allows a very flexible and quick way to install a printer for direct access via LPR/LPD.
KDEPrint has an "Add Printer Wizard" to make RLPR usage even easier.
The kprinter command allows switching to RLPR "on the fly" at any time.
Abbreviation for S imple N etwork M anagement P rotocol; SNMP is widely used to control all types of network node (Hosts, Routers, Switches, Gateways, Printers...) remotely.
Abbreviation for S ecure S ocket L ayer; SSL is a proprietary encryption method for data transfer over HTTP that was developed by Netscape.
It is now being replaced by an IETF standard named TLS.
Abbreviation for S ynchronous P eripheral O perations O n L ine; SPOOL ing enables printing applications (and users) to continue their work as the job is being taken care of by a system daemon, which stores the file at a temporary location until the printer is ready to print.
Abbreviation for T ransport L ayer S ecurity; TLS is an encryption standard for data transfered over HTTP 1.1; it is defined in RFC 2246; although based on the former SSL development (from Netscape) it is not fully compatible with it.
This is the second flavor of traditional UNIX printing (as opposed to BSD-style printing).
It uses a different command set (lp, lpadmin,...) to BSD, but is not fundamentally different from it.
However, the gap between the two is big enough to make the two incompatible, so that a BSD-client cannot simply print to a System V style print server without additional tweaking...
IPP is supposed to resolve this weakness and more.
Shareware software providing photo quality printing for many inkjet printers.
It is useful if you are unable to find a driver for your printer and may be hooked into either a traditional Ghostscript system or a modern CUPS system.
