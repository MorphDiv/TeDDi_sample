-오케이 가만히 있어

괜찮아.

제가 골프는 좀 못해요.

만약 방방에서 비즈니스를 한다면 느긋하게 사단점프로 사장까지 갈텐데.
아빠.

니 공연?

그래?

페인트냄새 많이 안맡으면 좋으련만.
미안해.

-필!

필!

자꾸 왼쪽으로 가네.

조금만이라도 미안하지 않아?

매일 '일어날 뻔'한 수십가지 일로 미안해 여보.
일어나지도 않은걸로 매번 사과하면 얼마나 비효율적이겠어?
골프 선수 왔어요
-올라 올라!

헤이!

나를 당신의 숙련된 손길이 다듬어주길 기다리는 반죽덩어리라고 생각하고..
-섬세하고 부드럽게..

뾰루퉁하게 굴꺼면 왜 골프를 가르쳐준다고 했어요?
우리 손주들 밥벌이 해야 하니까
-이쁜애기 여깄네

-캠이 공연때문에 부탁한게 워낙 많아서

의상 드라이크리닝받아야하고 안개만들게 드라이아이스사야하고
-캠한테 꽃도 좀 사줄려구요

완벽해.

-웃기네요

걱정하지말고 가요.

-조심해

괜찮아요.

단편영화 제작중이라 늦었습니다.

"A Slight At The Opera"
by 진초밥
자.

루벤.

너무 하드해.

좋아.

좋아.

그렇다고 주눅들지 마시고.

둘 째, 멀린 시크한테 출입허가를 했으니, 우리 공연을 보고 평론을 할꺼야.
그 여자 사악해요.

'뭐든 분다' (=날림이다)
솔직히 그 공연은 메인 소프라노가 최악이었어.
괜찮아 소피.

쟤 마이크에 전원 끄자.

마지막으로.

쉬면서 목청을 가다듬고 있으니까.

-그래서..

마커스가 어떻게 주연을 했는지 모르겠어요.

역할을 말아잡숴서.
그 날라리 위선자한테서 주연자릴 뺐어올 기회였죠
그 전에, 쓰러진 우리의 리더를 위해 묵념하죠
신이 함께하길 친구..

재미없어요.

아냐.

아기들은 많이 자야해.

-D 부인!

-셔츠 이쁘네 (음머..

너는 뭘 해야할지 알아서 부러워 나도 너처럼 영감이 떠올랐으면.
아니면..

-괜찮아요?

고모땜에 깼어요
배고픈가봐.

제가 달래볼께요
진짜 고마운데.

와우
저 애기 잘 봐요
까꿍하는거 봐봐요.

아뇨 그냥 잘하는거고..

제엔장!
장난쳐?

필한테 좀 더 잘해주려구요
쉽지 않은게, 운동이면 저는 군대조교처럼 변한단말이에요
애기도 생겼으니 글로리아가 좀 더 부드럽게 대하라는데
태어난지 한 달이나 됐잖아요.

뭐야?
-보이들, 안녕?

-여기서 뭐하는거야?

아버지랑 어릴때부터 골프했어요 위대한 '하임' 솔츠먼씨랑.
골프클럽에서 혹자들은 '채드 트레드웰'이라고도 불렀죠 (잘 쏘시는듯)
그럼 넷이서 그룹플레이할까요?
요상하게 들리긴 했지만 좋은거 같네
-좀 더 재밌게 만들어 볼까요?

나랑 필이 너희 둘이랑.

미첼, 먼저 할래?
예..

아버지만난게 우연은 아니었어요
자라면서 운동을 잘 못했는데 아버진 한 번도 지적을 안한적이 없었죠
잘 던지네 낸시.
낸시는 이웃집 애였는데 그녀처럼 잘 던지지 못했어요
골프장에서 페퍼를 만나기 전까진 아버지 이기는 걸 포기하고 있었어요
근데 반 정도는 한 거 있죠.
6개월 뒤엔 아버지 엉덩이를 걷어찰 준비가 되어 있었어요
계획도 완벽하게 짰었죠
티샷까지 긴장한거처럼 다가가서
허접한 연습스윙좀 하고
그리고선 정중앙에 딱 맞추는거죠
완벽한 포물선으로 그린에 안착하게.

와우
오케이.

고마워요.

모둘위해 박수..
-우.

뭐가 그렇게 오래걸려?
벽 칠하는게 얼마나 어렵다고
니 '노래'라는거보단 힘들어
그림은 납작(음정이 낮음)한게 맞는거고
-원숭이가 벽에 색칠하는거도 봤어

단핵증이요?

지자체에서 우리 펀딩 끊는데 이만큼 가까이왔어요.

마커스 바꿔주세요.

우린 가족같단 말에요
죄송해요.

마커스 소식 없나요?
왜 속삭이니?
목소릴 아낄려구요.

마커스는 나갔어 미안.

더 나은이라는건 모르겠는데 그렇게 말하신다면야
루크야.

-루크요?

-페인트향때문에 그래요.

-그만!

전에 세트 비판한거 때문이 아직도 스트레스받고 있단말이에요
제발..

그럼 내가 먼저 얘기할께요.

-비유하자면 예비배우가 주연이 일이 생겼을때 교대하는..

이봐 루크, 아님 유령인가?
돌려말하지 말아줄래?

마커스가 나가고 캠이 너가 대신했으면 한대
그래?

핑계대려 하지마.

이틀밤만 하는거니까..
또 그런다.

창피해지고.

-놀림?

근데 걔들은 필요없잖아..

연극 찐따들
벌몬트는 눈이 오고 라스베가스는 눈에 부시고
그리고, 기억나는 도시가 그게 전부네~
이게 계단 위에 있었다면..

-릴리.

이런 명확하게 위험한 상황을 의식 못하는 사람이 있다는게 안 믿겨져
봐.

그러게
-우리가 부모야

그래 알아.

만약 내가 안 괜찮다면?

재밌겠다
좋아.

아뇨 나 혼자가 아니에요.

글로리아 프리쳇, 세라 리오넬, 리초..

방금껀 일부러 그런거죠?
오케이.

한 시간은 걸릴거래
교대로 들지 않을래요?
아니.

매니 들고 침대로 가는거 봤어요
시간 죽일방법을 찾았어 내 초능력자(psychic)가 여기 코너에 있거든
제발 동료(Side kick)이라고 말했다고 해줘요
나도 모든걸 알고 있다고 생각했거든 점괘를 보러갈꺼야.

지금 장난하는거죠?
전화번호 기억해내려는거거든?
무슨일이 일어나고 있는거야?
한 3타쯤 뒤지고 있나?
누군가가 페퍼상담이 필요한거같아
그게 어째서 상담이야?
좀 더 화내.

알어.

모르겠어.

오케이 시작은 좀 그랬어.

이번 샷에는 그냥 무릎을 굽히는데만 집중을해서 쳐 보자
무릎 굽히고..

-펴졌어요

너는 알 낳는 거북이보다 모래를 더 차내고 있어!
봤어요?
그래.

이봐 고함질러서 미안해
아뇨.

진짜?
네.

여름방학때는 전화해서 갈궈서 저를 샤프하게 만들었어요.

너는 최악이야 필.

-방금 나한테 하라고..

들었지?

짜져 낸시!
도우려는것 뿐인데..
그냥 받아들이면서 들어
얜 초능력을 안 믿어요
초능력뿐만이 아녜요.

좀 도와드릴께요...

지금은 아니지만 곧
-봤지?

아주 소중한 아이가 될꺼야.

이번주에 중세축제를 가긴 하거든요
당연하지.

중세축제같은거 없어요.

우리 천문학 동아리에 웃음거리가 될거에요
그렇다고 글로리아한테 점쟁이가 거짓이라고 할 순 없잖아요
일단 좀 더 갖고놀고...
아주 즐거워하는게 보기 좋아
이상하게 들기겠지만 내가 다섯 살에 도망간 토끼인형이 어떻게 된지 아세요?
토끼는 없었어요 진짜 싫어해요
빨간 건물의 농장이 보이는구나
거기 누가 있는지 알아요!
헤일리랑 하는 단어맞추기같아요
어느순간부턴 자기와의 게임이죠
오케이 여러분.

아까 말했듯이 브로드웨이 버젼의 오페라를 본 게 도움이 됐죠
그들의 실수를 반영하게 되었으니까
예를들면 우린 유령이 첫 씬부터 등장해요 '오페라의 크리스틴과 라울'이 아니니깐
두 익명의 제보가 주연이 수두로 고생한다고 한다는데요?
-단핵증이에요

젠장.

안해요
오케이 알겠어..

-캠?

가끔 연극에서 진짜 드라마는 커튼 뒤에서 일어나죠
보시라
로크 던피.

-안해요

루크 던피.

그 표독스런 자칼한테 아무말 하지마!

최선을 다했어요.

무대 중심에 서는게 누군가에게는 부담이 되는가보죠
오케이 그럼 그 폭주족들이 먹는 약을 마커스한테 막 먹이면 될꺼야
아프대잖아요.

새벽 동이 트기전에는 항상 어두운..

한 가지 방법밖엔 없겠구나
-할께요

제가 한다고 할랬거든요?
그치만..

자.

계단위에서 그지?

-당신 탓이에요 필

괜찮아.

우리 가족사진 찍는게 어때?
구르기 시작하면 멈출 수 없지 전부 다 떨어지겠지
오.

확실하게 두지 않으면 위험요소를 보지 못하거든
아이 갖는거 재밌다!
쉽고.
내 운명인가봐
작은 천사같애.

쉬 헤일리.

헤일리한테 너무 일찍 가족을 시작하는게 위험하다고 말해주고 싶었지만
제 말을 듣겠어요?

-엄마!

내가 오늘 왜이러는지 모르겠네
-엄마!

-미안~

응.

미안
애 일어나면 아이스크림 먹으러가자
나도 같은생각했어!
뭐해요?
남이사
잠깐.

-그래서?

-아이스크림 먹으면 즐거울줄 알았지

난 그저 아이들이랑 좋은시간 보내고 싶을 뿐이야.

뭐 그럼 내가 망치는 거라고?
그 문자 누구야?
일 때문이야
전형적이구만.

고작 아이스크림갖고 화내는거야?
그렇게 들었다면 내 말을 전혀 안들었단거야.
나 혼란스럽네.

몰라!
-나 집에갈래

신나는구만.
마지막 퍼팅에 스윙이네요.

난 큰 퍼트(≒Butt,엉덩이)가 좋아 거짓말 못해.
빵터져
슬픈게 뭔지알아?

보기도 힘들구만
니차례야 에이스!
오.

우리아버진 안그랬어요.

학교 사운드시스템을 직접 설치해주시고도 관중석에서 목소리가 들리게 외치셨죠
여러분!

진지하게 행운을 빈다.
잘하고 있어.

진짜요?
우리 좀 더 자주 하자꾸나
듣지마.

-뭐?

내가 아들한테 그러거든
아들이라고?
예.

고양이 침대가 뭐에요?
그 노래 있잖아요.

예맨에서 카일이 한거처럼 강해져야 해
오마이갓 나 체망(가루거르는 체)이야.
미치.

백달러!
우리가 해냈어!
이제 바지에 맞는 셔츠도 살 수 있겠어!
클럽하우스에 한잔?
-안돼.

루크 좀 대신 안아주겠어요?
당연하지.

내가 조금만 덜 깐깐했으면 우리가 한 20년은 이 짓거리 더 했을텐데 그지?
내 잘못도 있어요.

-그럼 아까 진짜 고양이침대가 아녔어요?

내가 왜 그 노래를 모르는거지?
아냐 들어봤어.

-좀 과하게 감상적이에요

가면서 틀께요.

♩침대에 아이고양이랑 은수저♩
♩남자는 달에있고 아이는 우울해♩
♩언제 집에와요 아빠?

♩그땐 함께 할꺼야♩
♩그땐 즐거울꺼야♩
미리 골프 같이 할껄 그랬어요 아빠.
시간이 없었단다.
-루크!

차라리 군사지도를 그려줘야지..
시작할까요 필?
안돼요.

당신이 아는 사람에게 좋은 일이 생긴 것 같네요
예.

맞아 그거야.
그건 좀 눈대중인거 같네요
잠깐.

아님 에어컨이 켜졌거나요.

할머니에요
어느쪽이요?

-시가

-정말 보고싶어요

우리 풀헨시오 조를 볼 수 있다면 좋겠어요
봤대요.

정말 그렇죠?
사랑한다고 전해주세요
알고있대요
너무 고마워요
이제 알겠지?
알거 같아요.
오케이 매니.

-그건 뭐지?

불명예스러운 전 선생이 갑자기 내 연극에 관심이 있다고?
지금 자기 푸조를 주차하는 중이에요
대머리 독수리들(시체를 먹죠)이 날아들기 시작했구나
오케이 매니.

하지만 아직 니 유령을 만드는데 늦지 않았어
루크가 부른거 보고 그대로 흉내내렴.

아름다웠어요.

화도 났죠.

신과의 싸움이었죠
언니자리 맡아둬
실례지만 내 자린거 같은데?
아빠 여기서 뭐하는거에요?
장난쳐?

-자리 비었니?

그 스웨터..
테니스 팀이야..

기사들..
뭐야?
루크야...
니가 저기있을수 있었는데
그럼 안 맞았을거야.
어느 부분은 맞췄을꺼야.
그게 아니라...
여기서 만나줘서 고마워요
일에 좀 즐거움을 더할 수도 있죠 안그래?
나만큼 이 스포츠를 즐기는 사람이 있다는걸 알아서 너무 좋아요.
솔직하게 말해서요 칼.
옮겨야 할 짐은 잔뜩인데 정말 확실한 중개업자가 필요할거에요.
올라가!
중개료는 얼마나 확실한거죠?
보시다시피 아주 유연하죠.
솔직히 당신 마음에 들어요 진행했으면 좋겠네요
진짜요.

공식적으로 사인 할까요?
좋은 폼(from 1.폼,자세 2.문서)이구나 아들아!

여전하시네요 아빠
-우리 아빠에요

I'm afraid you're going to hit me again.
Don't worry.

I'm not the strongest golfer,
and I think it's holding me back in business.
Too bad deals aren't closed in a trampoline park.
I'd just lazy-back into a Rudolph
into a quadriffus right up the corporate ladder.
Hey, dad, you coming to my play tonight?
"Your" play?

Yeah, and Michelangelo "only" painted the sixteenth chapel.
Maybe don't keep your face so close to the paint cans.
Sorry, buddy, I'm getting a golf lesson
and then I'm playing with a client,
but I'll try to make your next performance.
- Phil!

Oh, you always do this.
You cram stuff in the freezer without thinking about it.
I opened the door, and a frozen turkey almost fell on my foot.
I keep pulling it to the left.
Are we sure the house is level?
Are you not the least bit sorry?
I could have broken a toe.
Honey, I'm sorry for dozens of things
every day that actually happen.
If I start apologizing for things that don't happen,
how productive of a person would I be?
Hey, your golf pro's here!
- Hola, hola.

Hey!
Thanks so much for the quick lesson, Jay.
Just think of me as a blob of Clay,
waiting for your experienced hands
to caress and coax me--
First rule of golf-- Shh.
- Okay.

If you're going to be a grump all day,
why did you even say that you were going to teach him?
Because he's how my grandkids get food.
There he is.
- Ay, thank you so much for taking care of the baby.

Cam has me running all kinds of errands for the play.
Yeah, well, you gotta keep your eye on the caller I.D.
I have to go to the dry cleaners to pick up the costumes...
Mm-hmm.
Then I have to go get the dry ice for the fog machine.
Mm-hmm.
And maybe I'll go get Cam some flowers.
Oh, Alex can help you with all that.
Oh, perfect.

We can't be late, or there won't be any dry ice in the house.
- Good one.

You guys have fun.

I got it handled here.
Be careful.
Don't worry, just keep your mouth open.
We're fine.

Okay, can I have everyone's attention, please?
Reuben?

That's a little harsh.

That's great.

All right, I will be recording today's rehearsal,
but don't let that make you self-conscious.
I'm only using it to pinpoint your mistakes.
Secondly, I have granted full set access to Maureen Schick,
who will be reviewing your show tonight.
Oh-oh, she's vicious.
Our last music teacher, Mr. Namagachi,
never recovered from her article, "anything blows."
But in fairness, I saw that production,
and the lead soprano was an absolute disaster.
No offense, Sophie.
You've blossomed since then, sweetie, okay?
No batteries in her mic, okay?

And lastly, Marcus Talbot.
Guys, he's feeling a little under the weather.
Fear not.

and he will be ready for the show tonight.
But I will need a phantom for this rehearsal.
So, anyone...
I guess I could help.
I don't know how Marcus ever got the lead.
But I know how he got sick-- from chewing all that scenery.
This was my chance to earn it back
from that insincere phony.
But first, a silent prayer for our fallen Captain Marcus.
Godspeed, old friend.
This is boring.

No, he's not dead.

Babies need to sleep a lot
so they grow bigger and stronger and smarter.
- Hey, Mrs. D.

- Every time.

Well, that's a nice shirt.
Thanks.

It's my best seller.
I'm so jealous you know what you want to do with your life.
I wish I was inspired like you.
Or, you know, aim higher.
Open yourself up to some new experiences
and find out what--
- Oh, my g--

Fine.

Good, you woke him up.
Maybe he's hungry.

but I don't think bottles can live up to the real thing.
Maybe I can calm him down.
Oh, that's very sweet of you, but he's super fussy today.
And when babies are fussy, they--they...
- Wow.

You should see him play peek-a-boo.

No.

I know a guy in Chicago-- he's amazing.
Dang it!
Are you kiddin' me?

I decided to go gentle with Phil,
which didn't come easy to me,
because I've always been a bit of a drill sergeant
when it comes to sports.
And with the new baby,
Gloria's been buggin' me to have more patience.
But come on.

How hard is it to support your own head?
What the hell?
Hello, boys.
What a sweet ride, Pepper.
What are you guys doing here?
I've been golfing for a few weeks.
Pepper's been teaching me.
I grew up golfing with my father,
the great Chaim Saltzman.
Or as he was known around the clubhouse,
Chad Treadwell.
Well, we should play together as a foursome.
First time that word's creeped me out, but okay.
Care to make it interesting?
I think your pants have already done that.
How 'bout a hundred bucks?
Me and Phil will play you and Mitch.
- Fun.

Oh, I...
Okay.

Running into my dad was no accident.
I wasn't the best athlete growing up,
and my dad never missed an opportunity
to point that out.
"Nice throw, Nancy!"
Nancy was our neighbor.
I could never throw as well as she could.
I'd pretty much given up on beating my dad at anything
until Pepper dragged me to a golf course one day.
Turns out I wasn't half bad.
Six months' practice later,
I was ready to kick my dad's ass.
I knew just how I was gonna do it, too.
I'd walk up to the tee all nervous,
do a few clumsy practice swings,
and then I'd hit that ball dead center,
watch it arc through the sky, land on the green,
and totally wow my dad.
Wow.
♪ It's over now ♪
♪ The music of the night ♪
Okay.

Thank you.

Give yourself a round.
Oh, Marcus's mom.

Fingers crossed.
Why is it taking you so long?
How hard is it to paint a wall?
A lot harder than your so-called singing.
At least this is supposed to be flat.
I once saw a monkey paint a wall.
Yeah?

Mono?

My career depends upon this.
The district is this close to cutting my funding,
and my fingers are very close together right now.

Any news about Marcus?
- Why are you whispering?

Oh.

But luckily, I found an even better phantom right here.
I wouldn't say better, but since you did...
Luke.

- Luke?

and he has a certain theatrical madness in his eyes
you cannot teach.
That's just from all the paint.
Oh.

Stop it.

What are you talking about?
He's already intimidated by you
after you criticized his sets.
Oh, please.

that found his unicorns distracting.
Let me talk to him first.
If I can't get the job done, then you step in...
Kind of like the way an understudy
would traditionally take over when the lead finds himself--
Yeah.

Hey there, Luke.

You wanna get to the point?
'Cause I'm kind of on a schedule,
and this paint keeps making me fall down.
Marcus is out, and Cam wants you to take over.
Really?

Stop trying to talk yourself out of it.

It's only for two nights.
You're doing it again, looking at the negatives.
Look at the bright side.

humiliate yourself, and get mocked forever?
- I'd get mocked?

But who needs them?

The theater geeks.
♪ Vermont is snowy ♪
♪ Las Vegas is showy ♪
♪ And those are the capitals I remember ♪
What if this had been at the top of the stairs?
I mean, I really could have gotten hurt, right?
Uh-huh.

Peanut butter.

It's just hard to believe
that somebody could be so oblivious
to a situation that is clearly dangerous.
Look at us.

I know.
- We're the parents.

I know what his response would be--
"but you're fine.

But what if I wasn't fine?
What if he walked through the door,
and he thought he had created a horrible accident?
Oh, this is so fun.
Good.

Grab your camera.
I'm gonna make his little hand flip us off again.
No, it's not just me.
Three mothers are giving the party,
and we need all our names in the card--
Gloria Pritchett, Sara Leonard, Dee Cho...
What do you mean that there's no more room?
Dee Cho must go on.
Okay, come on.

Okay, we'll be there then.
They won't be ready until one more hour.
You maybe wanna take a shift carrying this dry ice?
No, I just had a baby.
I've watched you carry Manny to bed.
I know what we can do to kill time.
My psychic is around the corner.
Please tell me you just said "sidekick."
I used to think that I knew everything, too.
We're going for a reading.
I'll let her know that we're coming.
Um...
You have got to be kidding me.
I'm trying to remember the telephone number.
What is happening to me?
All right, what are we, 3 strokes down now?
I think someone needs a Pepper talk.
Aah!

How is that a pepper talk?
You need to get angry.

That man's been Mitch-slapping you your entire life.
I know, but...

and Phil is way worse than I ever was.
I don't know.
Maybe he's not the unsympathetic jerk he used to be.
Okay, so you got off to a rough start.
Let's simplify.
On this shot, I want you to just concentrate
on bending your knees.
- You got it?

Bend my--
Dang it!

Son of a bitch, you're a hopeless embarrassment.
You're kickin' up more sand than a sea turtle layin' eggs.
Did you see that?

Yeah, that wasn't half bad.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry I yelled.
No, no, no.

My old tumbling master in college
used to yell at me all the time.

- Really?

He'd say terrible things about my manhood,
he'd throw the chalk bag at me,
he'd call me and taunt me over the summer to keep me sharp.
So bring it, Jay!
You stink, Phil.
You're the worst thing to happen to golf
since they let people wear shorts.
You just told me to--
No, that's part of it.
Did you hear that?
And he wasn't just talking to Phil.
He was talking to 10-year-old you
and 12-year-old you and...
Suck it, Nancy!
I was just trying to help.
Just listen with an open mind.
She doesn't believe in psychics.
It's not just psychics.
It's all unquantifiable phenomena.
I'm going to save you some time.
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
Maybe not now, but soon.
You see?
- That means--

You are going to meet someone special.
I see a handsome man on a horse,
like a knight.
Well, I am going to a renaissance fair this weekend.
Yes, I know.
There's no renaissance fair.
Even if there was, I wouldn't go.
I'd be the laughingstock of the young astronomer's club.
But I couldn't tell Gloria her fortune-teller was a fake...
Not until I had a little more fun.
I see that you're smiling.

I know it sounds crazy,
but could you please tell me what happened to
my bunny buttons, who ran away when I was 5?
Never had a bunny.

- I see a farm...

With a red barn.
I know who's in the barn!
It's like Scrabble with Haley.
After a while, you're just playing against yourself.
Okay, everyone, look sharp, please!
The press is here!
As I was saying, Maureen, I was really at an advantage
having seen the Broadway production.
I was able to learn from their mistakes.
For example, in my production,
the phantom appears in the first scene,
because after all, it's not called
"Christine and Raoul of the opera."
I have two sources telling me
your lead is home with chicken pox.
- Uh, mono.

Oh, damn, you're good.
Um, permission to speak...

Denied.
Okay, fine.

See for yourself in just a moment.
Tonight a star will be born.
- Cam?

Sometimes in the theater,
the real drama happens before the curtain rises.
Observe.
Luke Dunphy,
how would you like to play the starring role
in Cameron Tucker's Andrew Lloyd Webber's
"Phantom of the opera"?
Nope.
Luke Dunphy, is it true you passed
because of creative differences with an overbearing director?
Say nothing to that jackal!
Manny, what happened?
I tried my best.
He started hyperventilating just thinking about it.
I guess some people just aren't comfortable taking center stage.
Okay.

full of whatever they gave those bike riders.
He's too sick.

It's always darkest right before the...
Reuben, could you keep that thing still?

Okay, well, I guess we only have one option.
- I'll do it.

I was gonna say play the role myself,
but, you know, I guess it really should be about the kids.
Now if I had tripped on your father's golf ball,
say...

probably would have-

Taken out some pictures.
Look what you've done, Phil!
Mom!
It's okay.

Hey, we should take a picture of all of us.
Then once you get going, you know, you just can't stop.
You're taking everything down with you.
Oh!
And then, to make it perfectly clear
to your father what happened,
I'll put the golf ball right here,
because some people can't see the danger
unless it's right under their nose.
Having kids is fun.
And easy.
Maybe this is what I should do with my life.
Oh.
Oh, he's such a little angel.

Shh.

I wanted to tell Haley about the dangers
of starting a family too early,
but what could I say
that couldn't be said better by a screaming baby?
Mom!
Oh, sorry.
I don't know what's wrong with me today.
- Mom!

- Sorry.

Mm-hmm.

It's my--
Sorry.
When he wakes up, we should all go out for ice cream.
I was thinking the same thing.
What are you doing?
Minding my own business.
Wait.

So?
So I spent all afternoon cooking.
I thought ice cream would be fun.
All you've done today is have fun while I did all the work.
I'm just trying to make the most of it with these kids.
I don't have as much time with them as you do.
What, by spoiling them?
Who's that?

It's just about work.
Typical.

Why are you this upset about ice cream?
If that's what you think this is about,
then you haven't heard a word I've said!
I-I'm confused.

I don't know!
I'm going home!
Good!
Oh, fantastic.
One stroke down on the final hole.
It's such a big putt.

I like big putts, and I cannot lie.
Money.
You know what'll be sad?

to finally be able to beat your old man,
and coming up just short.
I almost...
can't watch.
Yeah!
You're up, ace.
Ohh!
I was the same way with my father.
It's always complicated.
Not for mine.

Never missed a tumbling meet or a break-dance brawl.
Heck, I'd set up the sound system for our school assembly,
he'd be the loudest voice in the crowd.
"Hey, everybody!

- Aw.

Hey, seriously, good luck.
You played good.

- Really?

Don't listen to him.

- What?

I do it to my son all the time.
Did he say "son"?
Yes.

Oh, I've said too much.
What's "Cats in the cradle"?
You know, that song about the dad who misses
all the important moments in his kid's life?
Stay strong,
just like Kyle did in Yemen.
Oh, my God, I'm a sieve.
All right, Mitch.

Five.

A-five, six, seven, eight.
- Ah ha ha!

A hundred bucks!
Oh, we did it!
Now I can afford the shirt that matches these pants.
So...

Can't.

Yeah, I'm meeting a client for another round of golf.
Hey, if you see Luke, will you give him a hug for me?
Will do.

about we should play again sometime.
It's a crazy thing
that if I'd been less of a hard head when you were a kid,
we could have had 20 years in this dumb game.
No, it was half my fault.
I mean, I-I used to be pretty sensitive.
So y-you really weren't
"Cat's in the cradling" me back there?
Of course not.
How have I not heard of this song you keep talking about?
- You have.

Unbearable.
I'll play it on the way back.

I should have golfed with you sooner, dad.
I never made the time.
Luke!
I need to call my son.
What time is it in Damascus?
Ugh.

Ready to play, Phil?
I can't, Carl!

I get the feeling that something wonderful
has happened to someone you know.
Yes, it's Manny.
He got the lead role in the school play.
Yes, that's it.
Okay, I think you might have met her halfway on that one.
Do you feel that?
A presence has just entered the room.
Or the A.C. kicked in.
Gloria, I have to say something.
It's your abuela.
Which one?
Is she smoking a pipe, or is she smoking a cigar?
A cigar.
- My mother's mother.

I miss her so much.
She says she misses you, too.
I wish that she was here now to see Fulgencio Joe.
She has seen him,
and she says he is beautiful.
He is, isn't he?
Ay.

She knows.
- Thank you so much for that.

You see now?
I think I do.

Okay, Manny, quick question.
Did you forget the notes I gave you
or just choose to ignore them?
Where are you going with that?
We need an extra one up front.
Mr. Namagachi decided to come.
Oh, you mean the disgraced teacher I replaced
suddenly has an interest in this production?
He's parking his Peugeot right now.
Wow, the vultures are officially circling.
Okay, Manny, it's no secret
that you were not my first choice for this,
or my second.
But it's not too late for you
to make this your very own phantom.
So I want you to watch what Luke did,
and copy that.

But my quarrel wasn't with Luke.
It was with God.
Save a seat for your sister.
Excuse me.

Dad!

Are you kiddin' me?
My grandson paints the sets for a play,
and I'm not gonna drive in from Florida, hmm?
Is this one taken?
- All yours.

Hey, thanks for meeting me here.
No reason we can't mix business
with a little pleasure.

I'm just excited to find someone who enjoys this sport
- as much as I do.

I'm gonna be straight with you, Carl.
You got a ton of inventory to move,
and you're in need of a serious realtor.
Hup hup!
So how firm are you on your commission?
As I think you can see, I'm quite flexible.
I'll be honest, Phil, I like you.
I think I'm ready to move forward with this.
Really?

Hey, you know, we could make this official.
Nice form, son!
I'm talking about that contract, of course.
You still got it, dad.
That's my dad.
Hi.
