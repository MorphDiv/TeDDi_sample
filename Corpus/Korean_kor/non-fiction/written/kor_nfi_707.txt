제이 포도 봤어요?
-먹었지

그릇에 있고, 씻겨졌고..

-새해때 쓰는거에요

바보같은게 아니라 전통이에요.
밤 12시에 한달에 하나씩 포도 열두개 먹고 매달 소원을 비는거에요.
그래서 그게 통하는거 같고?
5년전에 나는 가난한 싱글맘이었고
지금 나는 팜스프링스에 새차타고 다니고, 남편은 부자고..
당신 마음대로 해요.

말년 행사로 미첼이랑 필 부부를 팜스프링스의 호텔로 데려 가기로 했어요.
전부 다 있어요.

-포도요.

헤일리, 마지막날인데 파티같은거 안갈꺼야?
가서 자기 대학교가 얼마나 대단한지 들으라구요?
얼마나 대단한지 알아요.

어쨌든간에 니가 릴리를 돌봐준다는걸 미첼삼촌이 정말 든든하게 생각할꺼야.
사실은 니가 돌봐야하는거 알지?
내가 파티 안간다는걸 어떻게 알아요?
알았어요.
릴리, 사촌집에 자러갈 준비됐니?
누가 돌봐줘요?
헤일리지.
-농담하는거 아니에요

오케이.

매 연말마다 우리는..

그래서 제이의 계획이 반가웠어요 매번 뭘 하나 하는고민이 해결되니까
작년만큼 잘 할 수도 없으니까요.
놓쳤나?
-아직 열시야

-아직 열시.

열시밖에 안됐어!
모던패밀리 Season 4, Episode 11 ?

이쁜공쥬가 모던패밀리 본대요!
by 진초밥
내 기억보다 좁은데.
좁은게 문제에요?
마지막으로 온게 언제에요 제이?
오래 안됐어.

-내가 두살이었을때?

인터넷 확인했는데 사진이 이뻤단말이야.
도마뱀이네.

인터넷 사진은 절대 믿으면 안돼요
각만 잘 잡으면 뭐든 크고 좋게 보인단말이에요
-(야한얘기들은 반응인듯)

목소리가 들린다 했네.

오마이갓.

오케이.

프리쳇으로 예약했어요
제이 프리쳇?

오..

-얼마나 오래된 책이야?

로비..

그럴리 없어요.
그래..

그래도 재미있을거야.

샐리 스트로맨 트리오랑 춤도 추고.
둘밖에 안 남았어요.

-만약 더 묵고 싶으..

여기에요
문제있으세요?
아뇨아뇨.

괜찮아.

-뭐가 있는데요?

로맨스를 원하신다면..
외딴 온천이 있거든요,
숨겨진 보석이죠.
골프장 12번 홀 길 쭉 따라가세요
좋은거 같네..

어때요 필?
계란냄새 안나?

필이랑 저랑..

12월 내내...

아님 빠른 거시기도 없고.
창피해..

다시 한 번 고마워요.

오케이...

아빠랑 저녁먹는거 무시하고 온천 찾으러가요
제이를 무시하면 안돼.

우린 맨날 함께야.
또 그 '못 들어본' 이야길 들어야 되냐고
미첼이랑 캠의 릴리가 '하임리크 구조법'으로 생명을 구한 대단한 이야기를?
제발 좀.

그냥.

흥분되긴 하네..
그러는 동안 계속 당신 아빠생각만 할거같아.
샤워할께
-뭐에요?

오 이런.

그리스핀이 비컨에 올때 여기서 자면 안돼.
-비컨이 뭔대?

거길 가야해.

-저녁 빠지고 거기가자.

몰라..

기침하는척, 배탈..

너희 아버진 어떡하고?

우린 맨날 함께하잖아.
루크가 심리치료사한테 말 받아친 얘기를 몇 번이나 들어야해?
우리 목장집이라고 불러야겠어
둘 째 이야기(story=이야기,층)가 없거든
-기발하네

우리랑 같이 헝거게임놀이 안할래?
내 인생이 헝거게임이야 왜 너한테 못되게 굴겠니
내가 갈께
들어와.
-안녕x2

베카랑 사촌 조이스..

데이트라고?

-이일 알고있었어?

-조이스, 매니야

-얘기한거랑 다르잖아

그냥 껐다켰다하는게 아냐.

-옷 좋네

나 쓰려고 청소한게 아니니까.
자기들끼리 올라가잖아.

-몰라..

-뭐라고?

-될수도 있잖아..

잘 하고 있어.
추워.

그리고 루크가 블라우스 선생한테 그랬어요.

신께 맹새코.

미안하지만 난 여기가 정말 좋아.

항상 좋은 추억이 있었고 오늘도 아주 즐거워
치킨 키예프는 어때?
-정말 좋아요

러시아 맛이네요
-뭘 기다려?

여보
-자고있어

미안해요 클레어 그게 당신 루크랑 의사 얘기 또 해서 그런게 아니라, 요즘 피곤해서
오 이런.

예.

-오마이갓.

-아니.우리 핑계를 가져갔잖아

-여보.

살살..

가서 누이고 올께.

조금만 자고 다시올께요
-오 이런..

-이제야 하네..

릴리가 여기있었으면 하임리크를...

-니가 얘기할래?

-제이 가족들한테 돌아가요

모두 기다리긴 하겠지만.
-어쩜...

-그렇게 가고 싶다면...

어디갔어요?
몰라요.

그래도 체리 쥬빌레 드실래요?
불 붙여요.
제이 플렁켓씨..
-아니에요..

좀 꽝이에요.

우리도 한놈이 도망갔는데..

아는데..

참가비 얼마요?
-마티, 벅스한테 인사해요

-전남편 휴고.

-그리고.

빌리 디 윌리엄스?

그래요?

-그것도 안봤어

농담하는거죠?
빌리 디는 세계적인 모델겸 디자이너가 되는걸 포기하고 시카고에서
다이아나 로스랑 같이 있으려 하는 캐릭터에요
아들이 같이 보게 만들었어요 게이거든요
다행이네.

실례합니다.

눈에 안띄는가봐
어떻게 눈에 안띄어?

-저기요

실례해요 젊은이.

젊은이?

말도안되는곳이야 전부 11살이고 나는 더워 (Hot)
우리가 핫했음 술 마실 수 있었겠지
우리가 버텼으면 지금쯤 체리 쥬빌레를 먹고 있겠지
이봐 캠.

-여기요

-나 여기있어요

미안해 투명인간이 된 느낌이었어 괜찮아 질꺼야.
오케이.

언제까지 있는거야.

제발.

14살이야.

알았어.
뭘 원해?
문 열어둬야 해
-왜?

우리 짝짓기 할꺼니까.
어..

왜?

-윽

완벽해
-그렇지만..

무슨일이 일어난거지?
피뇨 델가도 한잔 어때?

뭐가 들었는데?
그냥, 시원하고.

그런말이 아니고.
마시지도 않을꺼야.
신년계획같은건 없어?
응.

못땠어
쟤가 맞어 조이스.

여태껏 나는 너한테 잘 해주려고 했는데 너는 무례하고, 음침하고, 무디게 굴었어.
새해를 부정적으로 시작하지 않을려고 하니까 이해해줘.
그리고 있다 배고프면 이에 낀 브로클리 빼먹도록 해
그 병신같은 길은 어딘거야?

-찾을 수 있을꺼야.

어.

왜 그런얘길 하는거야?
그냥 분위기 좀 바꿔볼려고 그래 너무 긴장했잖아.

-재미있잖아

-당신이랑 섹스하고 싶어요

-다시 말하게 하지마요

클레어..
무슨일이야?
한달된거 알아?
-그만큼 안됐어

추수감사절 다음날.
내가 기억하는게 크리스마스 선물을 예산대로 샀기때문에..
그런거에 내가 흥분하는거 알잖아.
-그렇지..

내가 당신 옷이 반값이라고 농담하니까 좋아했지.
그러면서도 했잖아요.
왜냐면 우린 언제나 그랬으니까.
어떻게 된거에요?
알잖아.

못하게 딱 막아버리잖아.
이젠 그냥 이런거야?
한달이 일년이되고.

참을수가 없어요.

그 온천을 찾아서 새해를 시작합시다.
온천에서 섹스로.
좋아 좋아.

맞어.

또 열두시까지 버티지도 못하는 명절로 보내기는 싫어.
이 명절이 내가 죽음으로 일초씩 다가가고 있다는걸 알리는것같아.
요거트때문에 이러는거야?
늙고싶지않아..

오케이.

알았어..

오케이.

우린 잘하고 있어.
오케이.

첫 째 바는 너무 어렸고, 둘 째는 뭔지 모르겠고.

미첼.

그게..

여기다.
젊어지고 싶댔지?
젊어진거 같아.
미안해.

스스로를 싫어하면 다른이를 좋아하기 힘들지
-맞는 말이야

매력적이고, 똑똑하고, 위트있고
니가 내 눈으로 널 볼 수 있다면 좋을텐데
정말 좋은 친구야.
친구?

-우정이 오래가잖아.

친구는 충분해.

무슨 계획이야 헤일리?
들어갈거야.

그냥 문열고 들어가면 안돼.

들어간다
-뭐하는거야?

브래지어랑 식탁보잖아
있다하면 안돼요?
미안한대.

-예.

응
머뭇거리고.

-나가

-나가야되.

그리고 여기 니콜 빗치같은 애가 거짓말했다고 전화하기 전에
가야겠네.

-뭐야?

-대장도 아니잖아

누나싫어
지금은 싫어해도 나중엔 고마워할꺼야
엄마한테 미안하다고 해야될거 같아
나 돌보는 사람 없어?
A투페어
블루스를 부르는 아가씨.

미안 빌리.

여왕한테 가야지 퀸 스트레이트.
-이제 됐어.

룸서비스는?

신선한건 없어요.

제이.

콜롬비아 전통이에요.

-우리집에 포도있는데

망친다고?

빌리디가 마음에 드네요
자정에 먹고 소원을 빌면되요
차로랑 러브보트 했을때 들었던 이야기랑 비슷한거 같네요
-차로도 알아요?

진짜요?
오마이갓.

고향에서 이런차를 안타면 마약왕이라고 못 불렸어요
-운전해볼래요?

차로랑 똑같네
그래서..

항상 그렇지.
우리 둘이서 사막하늘 밑에서
나는 아라비아의 로렌스..

아라비아 부인
-이봐요

좋네요..

-어..

-광고본거에요?

-로비...

샴페인 드실분?
-나 좀 줘요

-미안해요

-무례해 보일거 같아

이 차 최고에요
-이젠 어디로 가나요 빌리 디?

-그냥 빌리라 부르시고

이번엔 저기 저쪽 신사분이 보낸 겁니다.
또 공짜 술이네..

모델들이 이런느낌일것 같아
실례합니다 누가 당신 젊은 반 존슨 닮았다고 하지 않아요?
아뇨.

술은 안사고?
폰으로 반존슨 좀 찾아봐 어떤 기분이어야 할지 모르겠어
예쁜사람이야.

정말 좋네.

신사분들 곧 자정이에요 준비하세요
신년은 참 이상해요 시간에 대해 생각하게 만들고
그래서 무리하게 좋은 시간 보내려는거 같기도 하구요
조금 알거같긴 해요
빨리빨리.

지금은 그냥 시간을 늦췄으면 좋겠어요
얘 자라는데 준비가 안되어 있거든.
그러게.

해피 뉴이어.
너도
오마이갓.

미안 내꺼네.
진짜 너무 긴장해서.

이야기 진짜 좋아.
니 이야기만큼 좋지.

제이가 오네요.

우리 헌신적인 가족이 돌아왔네.

오마이갓..

실례합니다.

이런 스타를 만나게 되다니...
미첼인가 보군요.

빌리 디 윌리엄스는 스타워즈에 랜도 장군, 마호가니(75년作)배우입니다.
자막 by 진초밥 Jay?
Have you seen the grapes?
- Yeah, I ate them.

They were in a bowl, they were washed,
I paid for them.
They were for the New Year's.
Oh, right.

It's not goofy.

At midnight, you eat 12 grapes,
you make 12 wishes, one for each month of the year.
And you really think that works?
Five years ago,
I was a single mother living in a slum.
Today, I'm driving to Palm Springs
in my new car with my rich husband.
You do what you want.

For New Year's Eve, we're taking Phil and Claire
and Mitch and Cam to this amazing hotel
I used to go to in Palm Springs.
They got a whole package--
dinner, dancing, toast at midnight.
I mean, what more do you need?
- Grapes.

Haley, it's New Year's Eve.
Are you sure you don't wanna go to a party or something?
And listen to all my friends talk about
how awesome college is?
I know how awesome college is.

Well, I'm sure Uncle Mitchell
will feel much better leaving Lily here
knowing that you're in charge.
You know you're really in charge, right?
How do you know I don't have a party?
Okay, fine.
Lily, are you ready for your big sleepover with your cousins?
Who's watching me?
- Haley.

Alex.
Okay, let's go.
Every New Year's Eve, it's like,
"what are we gonna do?

So we were happy that Jay planned this whole thing.
It really, you know, takes the pressure off
of having to outdo ourselves.
Yeah, and how are we gonna possibly top last year?
Oh.

- Mm?

- What?

- What?

Place is smaller than I remember.
Smaller's your issue?
When was the last time that you were here, Jay?
Not that long ago.

So when I was 2?
I don't like when you do that.
I checked the web site.

Oh!

Never trust pictures on the Internet.
Shoot it from the right angle,
you can make anything look bigger and better.
Houses, you pervs.

I thought I heard voices.
Robby!

Oh, my God.

Okay, you be her, and I'll be whoever left her.
Uh, we're checking in.

Jay Pritchett.

You've been with us before.
How old is that book?
Oh, there is something sticky over here.
Robby!
It came back.
It's not possible.
Okay, so the place is not what it used to be.
But we're gonna have fun.
Dining in the starlight room,
little dancing with the Shelley Stroman trio.
Oh, there's just two left.

Check out's at 11:

No, 11:

Here we go.
Is there anything wrong?
No, no.

- a little more romantic.

It's not that bad.
- What's in there?

If you're looking for romance,
there's a secluded hot spring nearby.
- Kind of a hidden gem.

Just follow the path
right by the 12th hole of the golf course.
Wow.

Secluded.

- Sexy.

What do you think, Phil?
Does it smell like eggs?

It's been a while since Phil and I...
The whole month of December?
Or a quick...

It's embarrassing, and it's not like us.
That's making me anxious,
which is why I really need to get...
Thanks again.
Yeah, that's yours to keep.
Okay.
Bye now.
I say we bag dinner with my dad,
and go find that hot spring.
Honey, we can't just ditch your father.
He wanted us all to be together.
We are always together.
Oh, my God, what are we gonna hear
that we've never heard before?
Mitch and Cam's inspiring story
of how Lily saved that kid with the heimlich?
Please.

I say we get a bottle of champagne,
look up at the stars,
forget our bathing suits.
- That does sound hot.

But I'd just be thinking about your dad the whole time.
I'm gonna hop in the shower.
What's in there?
- Nothing.

Oh, perfect.

If we need any socks, someone left one in the bed.
Oh, my gosh.

when he comes to The Beacon.
What's The Beacon?
The club that he's always raving about.
It's right down the street.
That's where we should go.
Somewhere fun for New Year's,
while we're still young...

L-let's get out of dinner and go there.
- How?

Um...

Um, y-you could pretend to get sick at the table.
You know, fake a cough, stomachache,
dealer's choice.

Just sell it and get us out of there.
But what about your dad?
He wants the family to be together.
We are always together.
I mean, how many times do we have to hear Claire tell us
Luke's hilarious comeback to the pediatrician?
Oh, gosh.

Because she doesn't have a second story.
- So good.

Hey.

with all of us?
My whole life is a hunger game.
Why do you think I'm so mean to you?
That's for me!
Hey.

Hey.

Hey, I'm out.
This is Becca and her cousin Joyce.
And Joyce is for you.
What?

But I'm not wearing any cologne.
Did you know this was happening?
I don't even know what this is.
Joyce, this is Manny.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
Can I offer you a glass of sparkling cider?
He's not how you described him.
Uh, don't worry.

Manny, say something romantic.
I can't just turn it on.

- Cool shirt.

Can I see your room?
Well, I didn't clean it for me.
W--
They're going upstairs alone.
- Is that even allowed?

- Should we say something?

Like, "it's not okay"?
Well, maybe it is.

I don't know.

we're not doing our job as babysitters.
Of course we are.
I'm cold, and I saw a coyote.
...And Luke turns to him and says,
"Dr. Blaustein, really?

Hand to God!

You know, I'm sorry, but I love this place.
I know it's a little rough around the edges,
but I've always had a good time here,
and I'm having a great time tonight.
- Yeah.

How's your chicken Kiev?
- It's really good.

- Tasty.

What are you waiting for?

Not yet.

- Honey.

- You were sleeping.

Ay, I'm so sorry, Claire.
It wasn't because you were telling again
the Luke and the doctor story.
It's just that I've been so tired lately.
Oh.

- Are you okay?

- I think I might be coming down with a little something.

Oh, my God.
I know.

- No.

Honey.
Wake up, Gloria!
Easy.

I'm gonna walk her upstairs.
I think you need to lie down.
Okay.

- Okay.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Keep the party going.

There it is.

No, I have something stuck in my throat.
It's too bad Lily's not here to give you the heimlich.
Did we ever tell you guys that story?
Do you wanna tell it?
Yeah, let me tell it.

Jay, you should go back and spend time with your family.
I can't leave you alone on New Year's Eve,
even though everyone's waiting for me to come back.
Aw, that's so sweet.
Yeah.

the lighting of the cherries jubilee.
Jay, if you really want to go and--
Okay.
Where'd everybody go?
I don't know.

You still want the cherries jubilee?
Light 'er up.
Hey, if it isn't Jay Plunkett.
It isn't.

You having a good New Year's?
Eh, kind of a bust.

I'm gonna hit the sack.
Hey, we just had a guy who bailed on us.
You play Hold'em?
Yeah, but I should probably, uh...
What's the buy-in?
Jay...
Say hello to, uh, Marty, Bugs...
Hey.

- My ex-husband Hugo...

- And Billy Dee.

Are you serious?

I'm a huge fan.
Well, now you have to stay,
since none of these guys have seen me
in anything since "Mahogany."
- Never even saw that.

You're kidding.
Billy Dee's an alderman
trying to keep Diana Ross in Chicago,
rather than become
an international model and designer.
My son made me watch it with him.
He's gay.
Oh, good.

Excuse me!

He's doing this on purpose!
He probably just doesn't notice us.
How can he not notice us?
We're the only people in here in sleeves!
- Hey there.

Excuse me, young man.

Young man?

Ugh.

Everyone in here's 11, and I'm hot!
If we were hot, we'd be drinking right now.

Yeah, and if we'd stayed put,
we'd be enjoying cherries jubilee right now!
Hey, hey, hey.

It's new year's Eve.

Where's fun Cam who likes to dance?
Here.
Wh--where--where is he?
- I'm over here.

- Come on!

I was just feeling invisible!

Okay, you know what?

Oh!

They've been in there forever.
Do something.

Oh, please.

You really think they're doing something in there?

He's 14, but it's touching how close you are.
Fine.
What do you want?
You have to keep your door open.
- Why?

Because we're gonna make out.
Well, you...
You can't have your door closed.
- Why?

- Ew!

Perfect.
- But you can't--

What just happened?
Can I offer you a pina Delgado?
It's my own concoction.
- What's in it?

and it's not afraid to embrace its own whimsy.
I'm not saying that.
I'm not drinking it, either.
So...

Yeah.

You're mean.
You know, she's right, Joyce.

I've been a gracious host
while you've been rude, sullen, and dull.
You'll forgive me if I choose not to start the new year
on such a negative note.
Oh, and if you're hungry for broccoli later,
you'll find a piece in your teeth.
Where is this stupid path?
We've been walking forever.
We'll find it.
Did that bellman seem a little off to you?
Oh, totally.

Maybe this is all part of an elaborate plan to kill us.
Why would you even say that?
I'm just trying to lighten the mood.
You seem so tense.
Come on.

I don't wanna have an adventure.
I don't wanna have fun.

Wha--what?
Don't make me say it again.
No, I want you to say it again.
Maybe throw my name in there this time.
Claire, what's going on?
Do you know that it's been a month?
- No, it hasn't.

Day after Thanksgiving.
I remember because I came in under budget
on all of my Christmas gifts,
and you know how that gets me going.
Oh, yeah.

I made that joke about your clothes being half-off.
And yet we still did it,
'cause that's the kind of people we used to be.
What happened?
Nothing happened.

It was the holidays.

- You know, she has a way of...

Shutting that whole thing down.
But is this who we are now?
I mean, first it's a month, then it's a year,
then we're sleeping in twin beds and you're calling me "mother."
And I can't even bear it,
'cause we're just like my grandp--
Let's go find that hot spring
and start this new year off with...
- Sex in a hot spring.

All right, all right.
Where-

- Am I yelling?

Yeah.

and call it a night.
No, Cam, come on.
We can't have another New Year's
where we don't even make it to midnight.
I...

is just a giant reminder of how the clock is ticking.
You know, each passing second
is just bringing us that much closer to death.
All this because I suggested some fro-yo?
I'm...

I-I really need this.
Okay.
Let's get you to midnight.
'Kay.
Oh, look, he's our age.
Wherever he's going, I'm sure he'll fit right in.
Okay.
Okay, no judgment.

- Just not for us.

Okay, but we are not giving up, all right?
We're like Goldilocks.
The first bar was too young,
the second was...

and the third will be just right.
Mitchell...
Three bears.
I mean...

Here.

You wanted to feel young.
And I do.
I'm sorry.

I feel myself do it, but I can't stop.
It's hard to like someone when you don't like yourself.
You're right.
You have so many good qualities.
You're attractive, you're witty, you're bright.
I just wish you could see yourself through my eyes.
Aw, you're such a good friend.
Friend?

Well...

Not this one.

Happy New Year, Joyce.
So what's the plan, Haley?
I'm going in.

I'm not ready for all of this.
The girls, the hormones-- it's gross.
Well, we can't just barge in.
I'm still trying to get the image of mom and dad
out of my...

I'm coming in!
What are you doing?
Just putting away some laundry.
That's a bra.
And a tablecloth.
Can't you do this later?
Excuse me.

- Yes.

Yeah.
Big pause, no eye contact.
I was so much better at this than you.
- You're out.

Yes, she is.

- 14.

wants me to call her parents and tell them she lied...
I better go.

Wait.

- Because I said so.

Don't talk back to your sister.
Ugh!

You hate me now, but someday you'll thank me!
I think I owe mom a huge apology.
Is anyone watching me?
Aces and eights.
Lady sings the blues.

Sorry, Billy Dee,
but where do you go to tattle on prince Harry
when he's naked in Vegas?
Straight to the queen.
Well, that's it.

Me, too.
Oh, hell, it's almost 11:

I gotta do my set in the starlight room,
and I'm missing a pasty.
Oh, what's the matter with everybody?

Yeah, I'm having fun
for the first time since I got here.
Jay?
How long has she been there?
What are you doing here?
Gloria...
Everybody ditched me,
these guys invited me to play poker,
and look who I'm sitting next to.
- Eh...

Hello, I'm Billy Dee Williams.
Hello.

Jay, it's almost midnight, and we forgot to buy my grapes.
Did you try room service?

Oh, nothing fresh.
But you can always fish some out of a can of fruit cocktail.
Jay, you know that I need real grapes for my wishes.
It's a Colombian tradition.

Well, I have grapes at my house.
No, I don't want you to blow New Year's.
Oh, please.

I like you, Billy Dee.
So at midnight, you eat them and then you make your wishes.
Well, that sounds vaguely familiar.
I might have heard about that
when I did that "Love boat" with Charo.
You know Charo?
He's so obsessed with Charo.
No kidding.
Oh, my God.
A classic Rolls Corniche.
I have been in love with this car my whole life.
In my village, if you didn't drive one of these,
you couldn't call yourself a drug lord.
Would you like to drive it?
Does the bear sit in the woods?
Classic Charo.
Mmm?

Was it worth my meltdown?
It always is.
Just you and me, under the desert sky.
I'm Lawrence of Arabia,
you're Mrs...
of Arabia.
Hey there.
Oh, my God.
Sweet.

Welcome.
Uh, welcome to what?
To Nude Year's Eve.

- No.

I told them.
Robby.
So I--whoa.

You said Nude Year's Eve.

Yeah.

It's how we celebrate the new year.
- I can see.

Naked.
- Yeah.

Oh, my God.

We have to get out of here.
Our clothes are trapped under that pile.
You really wanna stand there naked
sifting through all those drawstring pants?
Oh, okay.

- Okay.

- Ah.

Phil, something just touched me,
- and it's not from your side.

Who wants champagne?
Oh, I'll have some.
- Okay.

Oh, sorry.

Thank you.
We gotta make a run for it.
Well, now it's just gonna seem rude.
Phil.
I love this car so much!
Where you gonna take us next, Billy Dee?
A surprise that's gonna blow your mind.
And just call me Billy.
Not doin' it.
And these are from the gentlemen at that table over there.
Oh, free drinks.

Thank you.

Thank you!
This is what models must feel like.
Excuse me, but has anyone ever told you
you look like a young van Johnson?
Oh, no.

Thank you.
Mm.

Pull up van Johnson on your phone.
I need to know how I feel about that.
He was gorgeous.

This is nice, huh?

What could be better?
Alright gentlemen!

Pucker up.
New Year's is so weird,
the way it makes you think about time.
Ten...

- Cam.

I think that's why
people put so much pressure on themselves to have fun.
Seven...

I mean, I guess I sorta get it.
Four...

Quick, quick!

Like right now I wish I could just slow down time,
'cause I am so not ready for him to grow up yet.
I know.
I want him to stay our stupid little brother.
Hey, happy New Year.
You too.
Oh, my God, what is in this?
- Oh.

...And I swear to you, I was so nervous,
I think I might have put on somebody else's underwear.
- I'm not kidding.

I love this story.
- Almost as good as yours, van Johnson.

Oh, look.

- I feel bad he missed all this fun.

- Hi, dad.

Everyone, this is our dear friend, Billy Dee Williams.
Hey, hey.
Oh, my God, it's Lando.
Excuse me, Mr. Williams,
I just have to tell you,
I've loved you since I was a little boy.
I'm so starstruck right now.
Well, you must be Mitchell.
Jay told me all about you.
