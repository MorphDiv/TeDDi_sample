The pdf_show_boxed() function outputs the string text in a box with its lower left position at (x-coor, y-coor). The boxes dimension is height by width. The parameter mode determines how the text is type set. If width and height are zero, the mode can be "left", "right" or "center". If width or height is unequal zero it can also be "justify" and "fulljustify".
If the parameter feature is set to "blind", the text is not shown.
Returns the number of characters that could not be processed because they did not fit into the box.
