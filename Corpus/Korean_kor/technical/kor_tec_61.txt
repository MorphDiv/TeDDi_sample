(PHP 4 = 4.2.0)
Aggregates properties from a class to an existing object using a list of property names. The optional paramater exclude is used to decide whether the list contains the names of class properties to include in the aggregation (i.e. exclude is FALSE, which is the default value), or to exclude from the aggregation (exclude is TRUE).
The properties whose names start with an underscore character (_), which are considered private to the aggregated class, are always excluded.
