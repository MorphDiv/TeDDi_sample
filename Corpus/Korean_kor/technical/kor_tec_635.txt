(PHP 4 = 4.3.0)
Returns a SSL-FTP stream on success or FALSE on error.
ftp_ssl_connect() opens a SSL-FTP connection to the specified host. The port parameter specifies an alternate port to connect to. If it's omitted or set to zero then the default FTP port 21 will be used.
The timeout parameter specifies the timeout for all subsequent network operations. If omitted, the default value is 90 seconds. The timeout can be changed and queried at any time with ftp_set_option() and ftp_get_option().
Why this function may not exist: ftp_ssl_connect() is only available if OpenSSL support is enabled into your version of PHP. If it's undefined and you've compiled FTP support then this is why.
