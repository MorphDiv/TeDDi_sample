This module contains an interface to the GNU Recode library, version 3.5. To be able to use the functions defined in this module you must compile you PHP interpreter using the --with-recode option. In order to do so, you must have GNU Recode 3.5 or higher installed on your system.
The GNU Recode library converts files between various coded character sets and surface encodings. When this cannot be achieved exactly, it may get rid of the offending characters or fall back on approximations. The library recognises or produces nearly 150 different character sets and is able to convert files between almost any pair. Most RFC 1345 character sets are supported.
