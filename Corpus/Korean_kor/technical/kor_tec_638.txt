(PHP 4)
Returns the argument which is at the arg_num 'th offset into a user-defined function's argument list. Function arguments are counted starting from zero. func_get_arg() will generate a warning if called from outside of a function definition.
If arg_num is greater than the number of arguments actually passed, a warning will be generated and func_get_arg() will return FALSE.

func_get_arg() may be used in conjunction with func_num_args() and func_get_args() to allow user-defined functions to accept variable-length argument lists.
참고: This function was added in PHP 4.
