swfbitmap() creates a new SWFBitmap object from the Jpeg or DBL file named filename. alphafilename indicates a MSK file to be used as an alpha mask for a Jpeg image.
참고: We can only deal with baseline (frame 0) jpegs, no baseline optimized or progressive scan jpegs!
SWFBitmap has the following methods: swfbitmap- getwidth() and swfbitmap- getheight().
You can't import png images directly, though- have to use the png2dbl utility to make a dbl ("define bits lossless") file from the png. The reason for this is that I don't want a dependency on the png library in ming- autoconf should solve this, but that's not set up yet.
예 1. Import PNG files
And you can put an alpha mask on a jpeg fill.
예 2. swfbitmap() example
