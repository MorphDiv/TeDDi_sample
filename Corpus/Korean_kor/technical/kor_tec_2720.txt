php_stream_getc() reads a single character from stream and returns it as an unsigned char cast as an int, or EOF if the end-of-file is reached, or an error occurred.
php_stream_getc() may block in the same way as php_stream_read() blocks.
The internal position of the stream is advanced by 1 if successful.
