(PHP 3 = 3.0.5, PHP 4)
unserialize() takes a single serialized variable (see serialize()) and converts it back into a PHP value. The converted value is returned, and can be an integer, double, string, array or object. If an object was serialized, its methods are not preserved in the returned value.
