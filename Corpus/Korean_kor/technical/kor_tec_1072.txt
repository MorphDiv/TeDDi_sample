Imports GET/POST/Cookie variables into the global scope. It is useful if you disabled register_globals, but would like to see some variables in the global scope.
Using the types parameter, you can specify which request variables to import. You can use 'G', 'P' and 'C' characters respectively for GET, POST and Cookie. These characters are not case sensitive, so you can also use any combination of 'g', 'p' and 'c'. POST includes the POST uploaded file information. Note that the order of the letters matters, as when using "gp", the POST variables will overwrite GET variables with the same name. Any other letters than GPC are discarded.
The prefix parameter is used as a variable name prefix, prepended before all variable's name imported into the global scope. So if you have a GET value named "userid", and provide a prefix "pref_", then you'll get a global variable named $pref_userid.
If you're interested in importing other variables into the global scope, such as SERVER, consider using extract().
참고: Although the prefix parameter is optional, you will get an E_NOTICE level error if you specify no prefix, or specify an empty string as a prefix. This is a possible security hazard. Notice level errors are not displayed using the default error reporting level.
