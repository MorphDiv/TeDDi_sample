(PHP 4 = 4.1.0)
The pcntl_signal() function installs a new signal handler for the signal indicated by signo. The signal handler is set to handler which may be the name of a user created function, or either of the two global constants SIG_IGN or SIG_DFL. The optional restart_syscalls specifies whether system call restarting should be used when this signal arrives and defaults to TRUE.
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
참고: The optional restart_syscalls parameter became available in PHP 4.3.0.
참고: The ability to use an object method as a callback became available in PHP 4.3.0. Note that when you set a handler to an object method, that object's reference count is increased which makes it persist until you either change the handler to something else, or your script ends.
