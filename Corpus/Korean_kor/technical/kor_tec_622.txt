ftp_nb_get() retrieves remote_file from the FTP server, and saves it to local_file locally. The transfer mode specified must be either FTP_ASCII or FTP_BINARY. The difference between this function and the ftp_get() is that this function retrieves the file asynchronously, so your program can perform other operations while the file is being downloaded.
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

예 1. ftp_nb_get() example
예 2. Resuming a download with ftp_nb_get()
예 3. Resuming a download at position 100 to a new file with ftp_nb_get()
In the example above, "newfile" is 100 bytes smaller than "README" on the FTP server because we started reading at offset 100. If we have not have disabled FTP_AUTOSEEK, the first 100 bytes of newfile will be '\0'.
