ircg_msg() will send the message to a channel or user on the server connected to by connection. A recipient starting with # or will send the message to a channel, anything else will be interpreted as a username.
Setting the optional parameter suppress to a TRUE value will suppress output of your message to your own connection. This so-called loopback is necessary, because the IRC server does not echo PRIVMSG commands back to us.
