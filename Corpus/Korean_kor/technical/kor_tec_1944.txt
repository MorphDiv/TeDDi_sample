(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns the array element in the previous place that's pointed by the internal array pointer, or FALSE if there are no more elements.
If the array contains empty elements then this function will return FALSE for these elements as well. To properly traverse an array which may contain empty elements see the each() function.
prev() behaves just like next(), except it rewinds the internal array pointer one place instead of advancing it.
See also: current(), end(), next(), and reset().
