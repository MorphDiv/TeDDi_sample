After calling sesam_query() with a "select type" query, this function gives you the number of columns in the result. Returns an integer describing the total number of columns (aka. fields) in the current result_id result set or FALSE on error.
For "immediate" statements, the value zero is returned. The SESAM "multiple field" columns count as their respective dimension, i.e., a three-column "multiple field" counts as three columns.
See also: sesam_query() and sesam_field_array() for a way to distinguish between "multiple field" columns and regular columns.
