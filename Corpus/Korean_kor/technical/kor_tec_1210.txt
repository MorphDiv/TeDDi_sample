(PHP 4 = 4.0.5)
Returns an associative array containing localized numeric and monetary formatting information.
localeconv() returns data based upon the current locale as set by setlocale(). The associative array that is returned contains the following fields:
The grouping fields contain arrays that define the way numbers should be grouped. For example, the grouping field for the en_US locale, would contain a 2 item array with the values 3 and 3. The higher the index in the array, the farther left the grouping is. If an array element is equal to CHAR_MAX, no further grouping is done. If an array element is equal to 0, the previous element should be used.

The constant CHAR_MAX is also defined for the use mentioned above.
