This function returns an associtative array of the names of all the files that have been loaded into a script using require_once(). The indexes of the array are the file names as used in the require_once() without the ".php" extension.
The example below
예 1. Printing the required and included files

참고: As of PHP 4.0.1pl2 this function assumes that the required_once files end in the extension ".php", other extensions do not work.
