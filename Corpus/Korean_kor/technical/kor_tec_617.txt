(PHP 3 = 3.0.13, PHP 4)
Returns a UNIX timestamp on success, or -1 on error.
ftp_mdtm() checks the last-modified time for a file, and returns it as a UNIX timestamp. If an error occurs, or the file does not exist, -1 is returned. Note that not all servers support this feature.
참고: ftp_mdtm() does not work with directories.
