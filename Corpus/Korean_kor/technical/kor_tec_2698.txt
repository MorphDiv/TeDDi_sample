PHP, like any other large system, is under constant scrutiny and improvement. Each new version will often include both major and minor changes to enhance and repair security flaws, configuration mishaps, and other issues that will affect the overall security and stability of your system.
Like other system-level scripting languages and programs, the best approach is to update often, and maintain awareness of the latest versions and their changes.
