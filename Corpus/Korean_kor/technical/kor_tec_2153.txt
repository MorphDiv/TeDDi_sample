(PHP 4 = 4.0.5)
Returns 0 if str1 is less than str2; 0 if str1 is greater than str2, and 0 if they are equal. strcoll() uses the current locale for doing the comparisons. If the current locale is C or POSIX, this function is equivalent to strcmp().
Note that this comparison is case sensitive, and unlike strcmp() this function is not binary safe.
참고: strcoll() was added in PHP 4.0.5, but was not enabled for win32 until 4.2.3.
See also ereg(), strcmp(), strcasecmp(), substr(), stristr(), strncasecmp(), strncmp(), strstr(), and setlocale().
