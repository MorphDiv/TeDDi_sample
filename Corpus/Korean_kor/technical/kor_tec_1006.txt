ImageTTFText() draws the string text in the image identified by im, starting at coordinates x, y (top left is 0, 0), at an angle of angle in color col, using the TrueType font file identified by fontfile.
The coordinates given by x, y will define the basepoint of the first character (roughly the lower-left corner of the character). This is different from the ImageString(), where x, y define the upper-right corner of the first character.
Angle is in degrees, with 0 degrees being left-to-right reading text (3 o'clock direction), and higher values representing a counter-clockwise rotation. (i.e., a value of 90 would result in bottom-to-top reading text).
Fontfile is the path to the TrueType font you wish to use.
Text is the text string which may include UTF-8 character sequences (of the form: #123;) to access characters in a font beyond the first 255.
Col is the color index. Using the negative of a color index has the effect of turning off antialiasing.
ImageTTFText() returns an array with 8 elements representing four points making the bounding box of the text. The order of the points is upper left, upper right, lower right, lower left. The points are relative to the text regardless of the angle, so "upper left" means in the top left-hand corner when you see the text horizontallty.
This example script will produce a black GIF 400x30 pixels, with the words "Testing..." in white in the font Arial.
