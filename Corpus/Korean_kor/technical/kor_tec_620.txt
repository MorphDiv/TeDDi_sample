ftp_nb_fget() retrieves remote_file from the FTP server, and writes it to the given file pointer, handle. The transfer mode specified must be either FTP_ASCII or FTP_BINARY. The difference between this function and the ftp_fget() is that this function retrieves the file asynchronously, so your program can perform other operations while the file is being downloaded.
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
