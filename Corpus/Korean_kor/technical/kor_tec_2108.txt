Sets the value of quick_print within the UCD SNMP library. When this is set (1), the SNMP library will return 'quick printed' values. This means that just the value will be printed. When quick_print is not enabled (default) the UCD SNMP library prints extra information including the type of the value (i.e. IpAddress or OID). Additionally, if quick_print is not enabled, the library prints additional hex values for all strings of three characters or less.
Setting quick_print is often used when using the information returned rather then displaying it.
The first value printed might be: 'Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00', whereas with quick_print enabled, just '0:00:00.00' would be printed.
By default the UCD SNMP library returns verbose values, quick_print is used to return only the value.
Currently strings are still returned with extra quotes, this will be corrected in a later release.
snmp_set_quick_print() is only available when using the UCD SNMP library. This function is not available when using the Windows SNMP library.
