proc_close() is similar to pclose() except that it only works on processes opened by proc_open(). proc_close() waits for the process to terminate, and returns it's exit code. If you have open pipes to that process, you should fclose() them prior to calling this function in order to avoid a deadlock - the child process may not be able to exit while the pipes are open.
