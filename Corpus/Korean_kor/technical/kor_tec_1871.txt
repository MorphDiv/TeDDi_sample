(PHP 4 = 4.2.0)
In versions before PHP 4.2.0 the syntax of this function was different, see the following definition:
The pathname argument specifies the pathname of the file to be imported as a large object. It returns FALSE if an error occurred, oid of the just created large object otherwise.
To use the large object (lo) interface, it is necessary to enclose it within a transaction block.
참고: When safe mode is enabled, PHP checks whether the files or directories you are about to operate on have the same UID (owner) as the script that is being executed.
참고: This function used to be called pg_loimport().
See also pg_lo_export() and pg_lo_open().
