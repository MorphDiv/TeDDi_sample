(PHP 4 = 4.2.0)
This function will send the contents of the output buffer (if any). If you want to further process the buffer's contents you have to call ob_get_contents() before ob_flush() as the buffer contents are discarded after ob_flush() is called.
This function does not destroy the output buffer like ob_end_flush() does.
See also ob_get_contents(), ob_clean(), ob_end_flush() and ob_end_clean().
