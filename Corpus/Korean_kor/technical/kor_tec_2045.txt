Returns: always TRUE.
sesam_disconnect() closes the logical link to a SESAM database (without actually disconnecting and unloading the driver).
Note that this isn't usually necessary, as the open connection is automatically closed at the end of the script's execution. Uncommitted data will be discarded, because an implicit sesam_rollback() is executed.
sesam_disconnect() will not close the persistent link, it will only invalidate the currently defined "catalog", "schema" and "user" triple, so that any sesam function called after sesam_disconnect() will fail.
