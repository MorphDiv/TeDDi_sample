(4.2.0 - 4.3.0 only)
This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own risk.
mb_ereg_replace() scans string for matches to pattern, then replaces the matched text with replacement and returns the result string or FALSE on error. Multibyte character can be used in pattern. The case will be ignored.
The internal encoding or the character encoding specified in mb_regex_encoding() will be used as character encoding.
참고: This function is supported in PHP 4.2.0 or higher.
