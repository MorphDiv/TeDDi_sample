(PHP 4 = 4.1.0)
Returns: An integer value with the current status.
fbsql_db_status() requests the current status of the database specified by database_name. If the link_identifier is omitted the default link_identifier will be used.
The return value can be one of the following constants:
FALSE - The exec handler for the host was invalid. This error will occur when the link_identifier connects directly to a database by using a port number. FBExec can be available on the server but no connection has been made for it.
FBSQL_UNKNOWN - The Status is unknown.
FBSQL_STOPPED - The database is not running. Use fbsql_start_db() to start the database.
FBSQL_STARTING - The database is starting.
FBSQL_RUNNING - The database is running and can be used to perform SQL operations.
FBSQL_STOPPING - The database is stopping.
FBSQL_NOEXEC - FBExec is not running on the server and it is not possible to get the status of the database.
