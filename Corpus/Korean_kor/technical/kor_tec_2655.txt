ncurses (new curses) is a free software emulation of curses in System V Rel 4.0 (and above). It uses terminfo format, supports pads, colors, multiple highlights, form characters and function key mapping. Because of the interactive nature of this library, it will be of little use for writing Web applications, but may be useful when writing scripts meant using PHP from the command line.
This extension is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this extension -- including the names of its functions and anything else documented about this extension -- may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this extension at your own risk.
Ncurses is available for the following platforms:



Digital Unix (aka OSF1)

GNU/Linux


OS/2



You need the ncurses libraries and headerfiles. Download the latest version from the ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/ or from an other GNU-Mirror.
To get these functions to work, you have to compile the CGI or CLI version of PHP with --with-ncurses[=DIR].
The behaviour of these functions is affected by settings in php.ini.
