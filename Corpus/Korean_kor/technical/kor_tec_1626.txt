(PHP 4 = 4.2.0)
openssl_csr_new() generates a new CSR (Certificate Signing Request) based on the information provided by dn, which represents the Distinguished Name to be used in the certificate.
privkey should be set to a private key that was previously generated by openssl_pkey_new() (or otherwise obtained from the other openssl_pkey family of functions). The corresponding public portion of the key will be used to sign the CSR.
extraattribs is used to specify additional configuration options for the CSR. Both dn and extraattribs are associative arrays whose keys are converted to OIDs and applied to the relevant part of the request.
참고: You need to have a valid openssl.cnf installed for this function to operate correctly. See the notes under the installation section for more information.
By default, the information in your system openssl.conf is used to initialize the request; you can specify a configuration file section by setting the config_section_section key of configargs. You can also specify and alternative openssl configuration file by setting the config key to the path of the file you want to use. The following keys, if present in configargs behave as their equivalents in the openssl.conf, as listed in the table below.

Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
