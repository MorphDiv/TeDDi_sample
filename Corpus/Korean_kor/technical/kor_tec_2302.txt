(PHP 4 = 4.0.5)
This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own risk.
swfmorph() creates a new SWFMorph object.
Also called a "shape tween". This thing lets you make those tacky twisting things that make your computer choke. Oh, joy!
The methods here are sort of weird. It would make more sense to just have newSWFMorph(shape1, shape2);, but as things are now, shape2 needs to know that it's the second part of a morph. (This, because it starts writing its output as soon as it gets drawing commands- if it kept its own description of its shapes and wrote on completion this and some other things would be much easier.)
SWFMorph has the following methods: swfmorph- getshape1() and swfmorph- getshape1().
This simple example will morph a big red square into a smaller blue black-bordered square.
