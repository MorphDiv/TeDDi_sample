(PHP 3 CVS only)
Returns: A SESAM "result identifier" on success, or FALSE on error.
sesam_execimm() executes an "immediate" statement (i.e., a statement like UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE which returns no result, and has no INPUT or OUTPUT variables). "select type" queries can not be used with sesam_execimm(). Sets the affected_rows value for retrieval by the sesam_affected_rows() function.
Note that sesam_query() can handle both "immediate" and "select-type" queries. Use sesam_execimm() only if you know beforehand what type of statement will be executed. An attempt to use SELECT type queries with sesam_execimm() will return $err["sqlstate"] == "42SBW".
The returned "result identifier" can not be used for retrieving anything but the sesam_affected_rows(); it is only returned for symmetry with the sesam_query() function.
