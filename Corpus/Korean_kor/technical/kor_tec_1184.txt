(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns the first attribute in the entry on success and FALSE on error.
Similar to reading entries, attributes are also read one by one from a particular entry. ldap_first_attribute() returns the first attribute in the entry pointed by the entry identifier. Remaining attributes are retrieved by calling ldap_next_attribute() successively. ber_identifier is the identifier to internal memory location pointer. It is passed by reference. The same ber_identifier is passed to the ldap_next_attribute() function, which modifies that pointer.
