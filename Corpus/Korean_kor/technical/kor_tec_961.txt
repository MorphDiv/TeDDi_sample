(PHP 4 = 4.0.1)
imagecreatefromxbm() returns an image identifier representing the image obtained from the given filename.
작은 정보: You can use a URL as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have been enabled. See fopen() for more details on how to specify the filename and 부록 H for a list of supported URL protocols.
Windows versions of PHP prior to PHP 4.3 do not support accessing remote files via this function, even if allow_url_fopen is enabled.
