(PHP 4)
This function will send the contents of the output buffer (if any) and turn output buffering off. If you want to further process the buffer's contents you have to call ob_get_contents() before ob_end_flush() as the buffer contents are discarded after ob_end_flush() is called.
See also ob_start(), ob_get_contents(), and ob_end_clean().
