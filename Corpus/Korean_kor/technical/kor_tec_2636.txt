This extension is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this extension -- including the names of its functions and anything else documented about this extension -- may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this extension at your own risk.
These functions allow you to access Ingres II database servers.
In order to have these functions available, you must compile php with Ingres support by using the --with-ingres option. You need the Open API library and header files included with Ingres II. If the II_SYSTEM environment variable isn't correctly set you may have to use --with-ingres=DIR to specify your Ingres installation directory.
When using this extension with Apache, if Apache does not start and complains with "PHP Fatal error: Unable to start ingres_ii module in Unknown on line 0" then make sure the environement variable II_SYSTEM is correctly set. Adding "export II_SYSTEM="/home/ingres/II" in the script that starts Apache, just before launching httpd, should be fine.
참고: If you already used PHP extensions to access other database servers, note that Ingres doesn't allow concurrent queries and/or transaction over one connection, thus you won't find any result or transaction handle in this extension. The result of a query must be treated before sending another query, and a transaction must be commited or rolled back before opening another transaction (which is automaticaly done when sending the first query).
