This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own risk.
swftextfield() creates a new text field object. Text Fields are less flexible than swftext() objects- they can't be rotated, scaled non-proportionally, or skewed, but they can be used as form entries, and they can use browser-defined fonts.
The optional flags change the text field's behavior. It has the following possibles values:




SWFTEXTFIELD_NOEDIT indicates that the field shouldn't be user-editable



SWFTextField has the following methods: swftextfield- setfont(), swftextfield- setbounds(), swftextfield- align(), swftextfield- setheight(), swftextfield- setleftmargin(), swftextfield- setrightmargin(), swftextfield- setmargins(), swftextfield- setindentation(), swftextfield- setlinespacing(), swftextfield- setcolor(), swftextfield- setname() and swftextfield- addstring().
