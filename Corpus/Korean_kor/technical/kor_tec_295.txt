(PHP 3, PHP 4)
The fields parameter is an array of arrays, each array describing the format of one field in the database. Each field consists of a name, a character indicating the field type, a length, and a precision.
The types of fields available are:
Boolean. These do not have a length or precision.
Memo. (Note that these aren't supported by PHP.) These do not have a length or precision.
Date (stored as YYYYMMDD). These do not have a length or precision.
Number. These have both a length and a precision (the number of digits after the decimal point).
String.
If the database is successfully created, a dbase_identifier is returned, otherwise FALSE is returned.
