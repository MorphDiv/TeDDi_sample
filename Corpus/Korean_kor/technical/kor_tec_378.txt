dio_open() opens a file and returns a new file descriptor for it, or FALSE if any error occurred. If flags is O_CREAT, optional third parameter mode will set the mode of the file (creation permissions). The flags parameter can be one of the following options:



O_CREAT - creates the file, if it doesn't already exist
O_EXCL - if both, O_CREAT and O_EXCL are set, dio_open() fails, if file already exists
O_TRUNC - if file exists, and its opened for write access, file will be truncated to zero length.
