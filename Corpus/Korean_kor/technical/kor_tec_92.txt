array_reduce() applies iteratively the function function to the elements of the array input, so as to reduce the array to a single value. If the optional initial is available, it will be used at the beginning of the process, or as a final result in case the array is empty.

ì˜ˆ 1. array_reduce() example
This will result in $b containing 15, $c containing 1200 (= 1*2*3*4*5*10), and $d containing 1.
