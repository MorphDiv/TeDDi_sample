PHP supports the direct io functions as described in the Posix Standard (Section 6) for performing I/O functions at a lower level than the C-Language stream I/O functions (fopen(), fread(),..). The use of the DIO functions should be considered only when direct control of a device is needed. In all other cases, the standard filesystem functions are more than adequate.
참고: This extension is not available on Windows platforms.
No external libraries are needed to build this extension.
To get these functions to work, you have to configure PHP with --enable-dio.
This extension has no configuration directives defined in php.ini.
One resource type is defined by this extension: a file descriptor returnded by dio_open().
