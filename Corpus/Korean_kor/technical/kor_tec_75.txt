array_diff_assoc() returns an array containing all the values from array1 that are not present in any of the other arguments. Note that the keys are used in the comparison unlike array_diff().

예 1. array_diff_assoc() example
In our example above you see the "a" = "green" pair is present in both arrays and thus it is not in the ouput from the function. Unlike this, the pair 0 = "red" is in the ouput because in the second argument "red" has key which is 1.
Two values from key = value pairs are considered equal only if (string) $elem1 === (string) $elem2. In other words a strict check takes place so the string representations must be the same.
참고: Please note that this function only checks one dimension of a n-dimensional array. Of course you can check deeper dimensions by using, for example, array_diff_assoc($array1[0], $array2[0]);.
