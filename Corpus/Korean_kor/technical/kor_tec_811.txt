Converts an object_record into an object array. The keys of the resulting array are the attributes names. Multi-value attributes like 'Title' in different languages form its own array. The keys of this array are the left part to the colon of the attribute value. This left part must be two characters long. Other multi-value attributes without a prefix form an indexed array. If the optional parameter is missing the attributes 'Title', 'Description' and 'Keyword' are treated as language attributes and the attributes 'Group', 'Parent' and 'HtmlAttr' as non-prefixed multi-value attributes. By passing an array holding the type for each attribute you can alter this behaviour. The array is an associated array with the attribute name as its key and the value being one of HW_ATTR_LANG or HW_ATTR_NONE
