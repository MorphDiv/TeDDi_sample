참고: This function is not implemented on Windows platforms. Try the PEAR class Net_DNS.
This function returns an array of associative arrays. Each associative array contains at minimum the following keys:
표 1. Basic DNS attributes
hostname should be a valid DNS hostname such as "www.example.com". Reverse lookups can be generated using in-addr.arpa notation, but gethostbyaddr() is more suitable for the majority of reverse lookups.
By default, dns_get_record() will search for any resource records associated with hostname. To limit the query, specify the optional type parameter. type may be any one of the following: DNS_A, DNS_CNAME, DNS_HINFO, DNS_MX, DNS_NS, DNS_PTR, DNS_SOA, DNS_TXT, DNS_AAAA, DNS_ALL or DNS_ANY. The default is DNS_ANY.
참고: Because of excentricities in the performance of libresolv between platforms, DNS_ANY will not always return every record, the slower DNS_ALL will collect all records more reliably.
The optional third and fourth arguments to this function, authns and addtl are passed by reference and, if given, will be populated with Resource Records for the Authoritative Name Servers, and any Additional Records respectively. See the example below.

표 2. Other keys in associative arrays dependant on 'type'

참고: Per DNS standards, email addresses are given in user.host format (for example: hostmaster.example.com as opposed to hostmaster@example.com), be sure to check this value and modify if necessary before using it with a functions such as mail().
예 1. Using dns_get_record()
Since it's very common to want the IP address of a mail server once the MX record has been resolved, dns_get_record() also returns an array in addtl which contains associate records. authns is returned as well conatining a list of authoritative name servers.
예 2. Using dns_get_record() and DNS_ANY
See also dns_get_mx(), and dns_check_record()
