Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
sesam_fetch_array() is an alternative version of sesam_fetch_row(). Instead of storing the data in the numeric indices of the result array, it stores the data in associative indices, using the field names as keys.
result_id is a valid result id returned by sesam_query() (select type queries only!).
For the valid values of the optional whence and offset parameters, see the sesam_fetch_row() function for details.
sesam_fetch_array() fetches one row of data from the result associated with the specified result identifier. The row is returned as an associative array. Each result column is stored with an associative index equal to its column (aka. field) name. The column names are converted to lower case.
Columns without a field name (e.g., results of arithmetic operations) and empty fields are not stored in the array. Also, if two or more columns of the result have the same column names, the later column will take precedence. In this situation, either call sesam_fetch_row() or make an alias for the column.
A special handling allows fetching "multiple field" columns (which would otherwise all have the same column names). For each column of a "multiple field", the index name is constructed by appending the string "(n)" where n is the sub-index of the multiple field column, ranging from 1 to its declared repetition factor. The indices are NOT zero based, in order to match the nomenclature used in the respective query syntax. For a column declared as:
Subsequent calls to sesam_fetch_array() would return the next (or prior, or n'th next/prior, depending on the scroll attributes) row in the result set, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
