swfshape- addfill() adds a solid fill to the shape's list of fill styles. swfshape- addfill() accepts three different types of arguments.
red, green, blue is a color (RGB mode). Last parameter a is optional.
The bitmap argument is an swfbitmap() object. The flags argument can be one of the following values: SWFFILL_CLIPPED_BITMAP or SWFFILL_TILED_BITMAP. Default is SWFFILL_TILED_BITMAP. I think.
The gradient argument is an swfgradient() object. The flags argument can be one of the following values: SWFFILL_RADIAL_GRADIENT or SWFFILL_LINEAR_GRADIENT. Default is SWFFILL_LINEAR_GRADIENT. I'm sure about this one. Really.
swfshape- addfill() returns an swffill() object for use with the swfshape- setleftfill() and swfshape- setrightfill() functions described below.
See also swfshape- setleftfill() and swfshape- setrightfill().
This simple example will draw a frame on a bitmap. Ah, here's another buglet in the flash player- it doesn't seem to care about the second shape's bitmap's transformation in a morph. According to spec, the bitmap should stretch along with the shape in this example..
