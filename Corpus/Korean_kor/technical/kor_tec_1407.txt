Returns a positive mSQL query identifier to the query result, or FALSE on error.
msql() selects a database and executes a query on it. If the optional link identifier isn't specified, the function will try to find an open link to the mSQL server and if no such link is found it'll try to create one as if msql_connect() was called with no arguments (see msql_connect()).
