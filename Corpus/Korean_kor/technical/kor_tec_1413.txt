(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns: An array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
mssql_fetch_array() is an extended version of mssql_fetch_row(). In addition to storing the data in the numeric indices of the result array, it also stores the data in associative indices, using the field names as keys.
An important thing to note is that using mssql_fetch_array() is NOT significantly slower than using mssql_fetch_row(), while it provides a significant added value.
For further details, also see mssql_fetch_row().
