A pseudo-object oriented mechanism for reading a directory. The given directory is opened. Two properties are available once directory has been opened. The handle property can be used with other directory functions such as readdir(), rewinddir() and closedir(). The path property is set to path the directory that was opened. Three methods are available: read, rewind and close.
