(PHP 3 = 3.0.3, PHP 4)
Checks whether a set of objects (documents or collections) specified by the object_id_array is part of the collections listed in collection_id_array. When the fourth parameter return_collections is 0, the subset of object ids that is part of the collections (i.e., the documents or collections that are children of one or more collections of collection ids or their subcollections, recursively) is returned as an array. When the fourth parameter is 1, however, the set of collections that have one or more objects of this subset as children are returned as an array. This option allows a client to, e.g., highlight the part of the collection hierarchy that contains the matches of a previous query, in a graphical overview.
