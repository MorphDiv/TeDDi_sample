This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own risk.
dbplus_curr() will read the data for the next tuple for the given relation, will make it the current tuple and will pass it back as an associative array in tuple.
The function will return zero (aka. DBPLUS_ERR_NOERR) on success or a db++ error code on failure. See dbplus_errcode() or the introduction to this chapter for more information on db++ error codes.
See also dbplus_first(), dbplus_curr(), dbplus_next(), and dbplus_last().
