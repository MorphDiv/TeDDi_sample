(PHP 4 = 4.0.5)
Sets an upper limit quota on a per mailbox basis. This function requires the imap_stream to have been opened as the mail administrator account. It will not work if opened as any other user.
This function is currently only available to users of the c-client2000 or greater library.
imap_stream is the stream pointer returned from a imap_open() call. This stream must be opened as the mail administrator, other wise this function will fail. quota_root is the mailbox to have a quota set. This should follow the IMAP standard format for a mailbox, 'user.name'. quota_limit is the maximum size (in KB) for the quota_root.
Returns TRUE on success and FALSE on error.
