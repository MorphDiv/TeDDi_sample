These functions are intended to work with mhash.
This is an interface to the mhash library. mhash supports a wide variety of hash algorithms such as MD5, SHA1, GOST, and many others.
To use it, download the mhash distribution from its web site and follow the included installation instructions. You need to compile PHP with the --with-mhash parameter to enable this extension.
Mhash can be used to create checksums, message digests, message authentication codes, and more.

ì˜ˆ 1. Compute the MD5 digest and hmac and print it out as hex
Here is a list of hashes which are currently supported by mhash. If a hash is not listed here, but is listed by mhash as supported, you can safely assume that this documentation is outdated.
