(PHP 4 = 4.0.6)
dbx_query() returns an object or 1 on success, and 0 on failure. The result object is returned only if the query given in sql_statement produces a result set.
예 1. How to handle the returned value
The flags parameter is used to control the amount of information that is returned. It may be any combination of the following constants with the bitwise OR operator (|). The DBX_COLNAMES_* flags override the dbx.colnames_case setting from php.ini.
It is always set, that is, the returned object has a data property which is a 2 dimensional array indexed numerically. For example, in the expression data[2][3] 2 stands for the row (or record) number and 3 stands for the column (or field) number. The first row and column are indexed at 0.
If DBX_RESULT_ASSOC is also specified, the returning object contains the information related to DBX_RESULT_INFO too, even if it was not specified.
It provides info about columns, such as field names and field types.
It effects that the field values can be accessed with the respective column names used as keys to the returned object's data property.
Associated results are actually references to the numerically indexed data, so modifying data[0][0] causes that data[0]['field_name_for_first_column'] is modified as well.
The case of the returned column names will not be changed.
The case of the returned column names will be changed to uppercase.
The case of the returned column names will be changed to lowercase.


DBX_RESULT_INDEX | DBX_RESULT_INFO | DBX_RESULT_ASSOC - this is the default, if flags is not specified.
The returing object has four or five properties depending on flags:
It is a valid handle for the connected database, and as such it can be used in module specific functions (if required).
These contain the number of columns (or fields) and rows (or records) respectively.
It is returned only if either DBX_RESULT_INFO or DBX_RESULT_ASSOC is specified in the flags parameter. It is a 2 dimensional array, that has two named rows (name and type) to retrieve column information.
예 2. lists each field's name and type
This property contains the actual resulting data, possibly associated with column names as well depending on flags. If DBX_RESULT_ASSOC is set, it is possible to use $result- data[2]["field_name"].
예 3. outputs the content of data property into HTML table
참고: Always refer to the module-specific documentation as well.
Column names for queries on an Oracle database are returned in lowercase.
