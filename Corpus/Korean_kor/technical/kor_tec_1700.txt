(PHP 4)
parse_ini_file() loads in the ini file specified in filename, and returns the settings in it in an associative array. By setting the last process_sections parameter to TRUE, you get a multidimensional array, with the section names and settings included. The default for process_sections is FALSE
참고: This function has nothing to do with the php.ini file. It is already processed, the time you run your script. This function can be used to read in your own application's configuration files.
참고: If a value in the ini file contains any non-alphanumeric characters it needs to be enclosed in double-quotes (").
참고: Since PHP 4.2.1 this function is also affected by safe_mode and open_basedir.
The structure of the ini file is similar to that of the php.ini 's.
Constants may also be parsed in the ini file so if you define a constant as an ini value before running parse_ini_file(), it will be integrated into the results. Only ini values are evaluated. For example:

예 1. Contents of sample.ini

예 2. parse_ini_file() example
Would produce:
