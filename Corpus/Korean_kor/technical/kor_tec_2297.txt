(PHP 4 = 4.0.5)
This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own risk.
If filename is the name of an FDB file (i.e., it ends in ".fdb"), load the font definition found in said file. Otherwise, create a browser-defined font reference.
FDB ("font definition block") is a very simple wrapper for the SWF DefineFont2 block which contains a full description of a font. One may create FDB files from SWT Generator template files with the included makefdb utility- look in the util directory off the main ming distribution directory.
Browser-defined fonts don't contain any information about the font other than its name. It is assumed that the font definition will be provided by the movie player. The fonts _serif, _sans, and _typewriter should always be available. For example:
swffont() returns a reference to the font definition, for use in the SWFText- setFont() and the SWFTextField- setFont() methods.
SWFFont has the following methods: swffont- getwidth().
