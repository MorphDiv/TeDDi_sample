These functions can be used to write XML-RPC servers and clients. You can find more information about XML-RPC at http://www.xmlrpc.com/, and more documentation on this extension and it's functions at http://xmlrpc-epi.sourceforge.net/.
This extension is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this extension -- including the names of its functions and anything else documented about this extension -- may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this extension at your own risk.
No external libraries are needed to build this extension.
XML-RPC support in PHP is not enabled by default. You will need to use the --with-xmlrpc[=DIR] configuration option when compiling PHP to enable XML-RPC support. This extension is bundled into PHP as of 4.1.0.
The behaviour of these functions is affected by settings in php.ini.
