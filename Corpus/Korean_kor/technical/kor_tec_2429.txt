This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own risk.
This function creates an instance of the data type named typename, filling in the values of the data type. The typename parameter is case sensitive. You should give the values in the same order as you defined the data type with w32api_deftype(). The type of the resource returned is dynaparm.
