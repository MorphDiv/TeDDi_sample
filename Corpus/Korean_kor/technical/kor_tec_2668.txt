This extension allows you to process credit cards and other financial transactions using Verisign Payment Services, formerly known as Signio (http://www.verisign.com/products/payflow/pro/index.html).
These functions are only available if PHP has been compiled with the --with-pfpro[=DIR] option. You will require the appropriate SDK for your platform, which may be downloaded from within the manager interface once you have registered.
Once you have downloaded the SDK you should copy the files from the lib directory of the distribution. Copy the header file pfpro.h to /usr/local/include and the library file libpfpro.so to /usr/local/lib.
When using these functions, you may omit calls to pfpro_init() and pfpro_cleanup() as this extension will do so automatically if required. However the functions are still available in case you are processing a number of transactions and require fine control over the library. You may perform any number of transactions using pfpro_process() between the two.
These functions have been added in PHP 4.0.2.
참고: These functions only provide a link to Verisign Payment Services. Be sure to read the Payflow Pro Developers Guide for full details of the required parameters.
