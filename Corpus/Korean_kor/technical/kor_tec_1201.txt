(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns a search result identifier or FALSE on error.
ldap_read() performs the search for a specified filter on the directory with the scope LDAP_SCOPE_BASE. So it is equivalent to reading an entry from the directory.
An empty filter is not allowed. If you want to retrieve absolutely all information for this entry, use a filter of "objectClass=*". If you know which entry types are used on the directory server, you might use an appropriate filter such as "objectClass=inetOrgPerson".
This call takes 5 optional parameters. See ldap_search() notes.
참고: These optional parameters were added in 4.0.2: attrsonly, sizelimit, timelimit, deref.
