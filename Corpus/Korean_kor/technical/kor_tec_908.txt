(PHP 3 = 3.0.8, PHP 4)
result_id is a valid result id returned by ifx_query() or ifx_prepare().
Returns a pseudo-row (associative array) with sqlca.sqlerrd[0]... sqlca.sqlerrd[5] after the query associated with result_id.
For inserts, updates and deletes the values returned are those as set by the server after executing the query. This gives access to the number of affected rows and the serial insert value. For SELECTs the values are those saved after the PREPARE statement. This gives access to the *estimated* number of affected rows. The use of this function saves the overhead of executing a "select dbinfo('sqlca.sqlerrdx')" query, as it retrieves the values that were saved by the ifx driver at the appropriate moment.
