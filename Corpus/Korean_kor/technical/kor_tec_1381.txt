(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
msql_fetch_row() fetches one row of data from the result associated with the specified query identifier. The row is returned as an array. Each result column is stored in an array offset, starting at offset 0.
Subsequent call to msql_fetch_row() would return the next row in the result set, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
