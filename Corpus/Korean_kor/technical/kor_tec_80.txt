(PHP 4 = 4.3.0)
array_intersect_assoc() returns an array containing all the values of array1 that are present in all the arguments. Note that the keys are used in the comparison unlike in array_intersect().

ì˜ˆ 1. array_intersect_assoc() example
In our example you see that only the pair "a" = "green" is present in both arrays and thus is returned. The value "red" is not returned because in $array1 it's key is 2 while the key of "red" in $array2 it is 1.
The two values from the key = value pairs are considered equal only if (string) $elem1 === (string) $elem2. In otherwords a strict type check is executed so the string representation must be the same.
See also array_intersect(), array_diff() and array_diff_assoc().
