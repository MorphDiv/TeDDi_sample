(PHP 3 = 3.0.3, PHP 4)
The Informix error codes (SQLSTATE SQLCODE) formatted as follows:
x [SQLSTATE = aa bbb SQLCODE=cccc]





If the "x" character is anything other than space, SQLSTATE and SQLCODE describe the error in more detail.

Returns in a string one character describing the general results of a statement and both SQLSTATE and SQLCODE associated with the most recent SQL statement executed. The format of the string is "(char) [SQLSTATE=(two digits) (three digits) SQLCODE=(one digit)]". The first character can be '' (space) (success), 'W' (the statement caused some warning), 'E' (an error happened when executing the statement) or 'N' (the statement didn't return any data).
