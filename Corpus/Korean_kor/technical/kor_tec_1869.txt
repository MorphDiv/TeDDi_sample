(PHP 4 = 4.2.0)
pg_lo_create() creates a Large Object and returns the oid of the large object. connection specifies a valid database connection opened by pg_connect() or pg_pconnect(). PostgreSQL access modes INV_READ, INV_WRITE, and INV_ARCHIVE are not supported, the object is created always with both read and write access. INV_ARCHIVE has been removed from PostgreSQL itself (version 6.3 and above). It returns large object oid, otherwise it returns FALSE if an error occurred.
To use the large object (lo) interface, it is necessary to enclose it within a transaction block.
참고: This function used to be called pg_locreate().
