(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns a connection index on success, or FALSE if the connection could not be made. Opens a connection to a PostgreSQL database. The arguments should be within a quoted string. The arguments available include dbname port, host, tty, options, user, and password
This function returns a connection index that is needed by other PostgreSQL functions. You can have multiple connections open at once.
The previous syntax of: $conn = pg_pconnect ("host", "port", "options", "tty", "dbname") has been deprecated.
See also pg_connect().
