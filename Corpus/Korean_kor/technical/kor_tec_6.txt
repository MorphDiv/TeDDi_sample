Here is the aliases list. All aliases are listed here. It is usually a bad idea to use aliases, are they may be bound to obsolescence or renaming, which will lead to unportable script. This list is provided to help those who want to upgrade their old scripts to newer syntax.
However, some functions simply have two names, and there is no real preference. (For example, is_int() and is_integer() are equally good)
This list is consistent with PHP 4.0.6.
