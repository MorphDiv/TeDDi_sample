mb_convert_variables() convert character encoding of variables vars in encoding from-encoding to encoding to-encoding. It returns character encoding before conversion for success, FALSE for failure.
mb_convert_variables() join strings in Array or Object to detect encoding, since encoding detection tends to fail for short strings. Therefore, it is impossible to mix encoding in single array or object.
It from-encoding is specified by array or comma separated string, it tries to detect encoding from from-coding. When encoding is omitted, detect_order is used.
vars (3rd and larger) is reference to variable to be converted. String, Array and Object are accepted. mb_convert_variables() assumes all parameters have the same encoding.
