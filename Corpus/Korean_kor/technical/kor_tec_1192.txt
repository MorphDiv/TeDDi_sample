Returns an array of values for the attribute on success and FALSE on error.
ldap_get_values_len() function is used to read all the values of the attribute in the entry in the result. entry is specified by the result_entry_identifier. The number of values can be found by indexing "count" in the resultant array. Individual values are accessed by integer index in the array. The first index is 0.
This function is used exactly like ldap_get_values() except that it handles binary data and not string data.
참고: This function was added in 4.0.
