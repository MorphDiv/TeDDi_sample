(PHP 4 = 4.0.6)
mb_detect_order() sets automatic character encoding detection order to encoding-list. It returns TRUE for success, FALSE for failure.
encoding-list is array or comma separated list of character encoding. ("auto" is expanded to "ASCII, JIS, UTF-8, EUC-JP, SJIS")
If encoding-list is omitted, it returns current character encoding detection order as array.
This setting affects mb_detect_encoding() and mb_send_mail().
참고: mbstring currently implements following encoding detection filters. If there is a invalid byte sequence for following encoding, encoding detection will fail.
참고: UTF-8, UTF-7, ASCII, EUC-JP, SJIS, eucJP-win, SJIS-win, JIS, ISO-2022-JP
For ISO-8859-*, mbstring always detects as ISO-8859-*.
For UTF-16, UTF-32, UCS2 and UCS4, encoding detection will fail always.
