(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns an array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
msql_fetch_array() is an extended version of msql_fetch_row(). In addition to storing the data in the numeric indices of the result array, it also stores the data in associative indices, using the field names as keys.
The second optional argument result_type in msql_fetch_array() is a constant and can take the following values: MSQL_ASSOC, MSQL_NUM, and MSQL_BOTH.
Be careful if you are retrieving results from a query that may return a record that contains only one field that has a value of 0 (or an empty string, or NULL).
An important thing to note is that using msql_fetch_array() is NOT significantly slower than using msql_fetch_row(), while it provides a significant added value.
For further details, also see msql_fetch_row().
