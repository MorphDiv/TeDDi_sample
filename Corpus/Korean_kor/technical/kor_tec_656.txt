(PHP 4)
This function returns an associtative array of the names of all the files that have been loaded into a script using include_once(). The indexes of the array are the file names as used in the include_once() without the ".php" extension.

참고: As of PHP 4.0.1pl2 this function assumes that the include_once files end in the extension ".php", other extensions do not work.
