This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own risk.
swfdisplayitem- setratio() sets the object's ratio to ratio. Obviously only useful for morphs.
The object may be a swfshape(), a swfbutton(), a swftext() or a swfsprite() object. It must have been added using the swfmovie- add().
This simple example will morph nicely three concentric circles.
