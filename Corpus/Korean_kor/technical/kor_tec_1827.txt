Returns: A string containing the response.
pfpro_process_raw() processes a raw transaction string with Payflow Pro. You should really use pfpro_process() instead, as the encoding rules of these transactions are non-standard.
The first parameter in this case is a string containing the raw transaction request. All other parameters are the same as with pfpro_process(). The return value is a string containing the raw response.
참고: Be sure to read the Payflow Pro Developers Guide for full details of the required parameters and encoding rules. You would be well advised to use pfpro_process() instead.
