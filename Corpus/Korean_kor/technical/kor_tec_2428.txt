This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own risk.
If you would like to define a type for a w32api call, you need to call w32api_deftype(). This function takes 2n+1 arguments, where n is the number of members the type has. The first argument is the name of the type. After that is the type of the member followed by the members name (in pairs). A member type can be a user defined type. All the type names are case sensitive. Built in type names should be provided in lowercase. Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
