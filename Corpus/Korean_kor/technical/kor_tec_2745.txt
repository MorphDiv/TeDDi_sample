Various parts of the PHP language are represented internally by types like T_SR. PHP outputs identifiers like this one in parse errors, like "Parse error: unexpected T_SR, expecting ',' or ';' in script.php on line 10."
You're supposed to know what T_SR means. For everybody who doesn't know that, here is a table with those identifiers, PHP-syntax and references to the appropriate places in the manual.
