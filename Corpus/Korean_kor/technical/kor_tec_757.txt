(PHP 4)
The highlight_file() function prints out a syntax higlighted version of the code contained in filename using the colors defined in the built-in syntax highlighter for PHP. It returns TRUE on success, FALSE otherwise (PHP 4).

ì˜ˆ 1. Creating a source highlighting URL
To setup a URL that can code hightlight any script that you pass to it, we will make use of the "ForceType" directive in Apache to generate a nice URL pattern, and use the function highlight_file() to show a nice looking code list.
In your httpd.conf you can add the following:

And then make a file named "source" and put it in your web root directory.

Then you can use an URL like the one below to display a colorized version of a script located in "/path/to/script.php" in your web site.
