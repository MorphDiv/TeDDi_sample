Uploads a document into the collection with parent_id. The document has to be created before with hw_NewDocument(). Make sure that the object record of the new document contains at least the attributes: Type, DocumentType, Title and Name. Possibly you also want to set the MimeType. The functions returns the object id of the new document or FALSE.
See also hw_PipeDocument().
