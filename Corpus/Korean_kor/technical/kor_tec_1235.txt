(4.2.0 - 4.3.0 only)
This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own risk.
mb_ereg_search_pos() returns an array including position of matched part for multibyte regular expression. The first element of the array will be the beggining of matched part, the second element will be length (bytes) of matched part. It returns FALSE on error.
The string for match is specified by mb_ereg_search_init(). It it is not specified, the previous one will be used.
The internal encoding or the character encoding specified in mb_regex_encoding() will be used as character encoding.
참고: This function is supported in PHP 4.2.0 or higher.
