Returns entry identifier for the next entry in the result whose entries are being read starting with ldap_first_entry(). If there are no more entries in the result then it returns FALSE.
ldap_next_entry() function is used to retrieve the entries stored in the result. Successive calls to the ldap_next_entry() return entries one by one till there are no more entries. The first call to ldap_next_entry() is made after the call to ldap_first_entry() with the result_identifier as returned from the ldap_first_entry().
