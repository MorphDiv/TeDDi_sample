ovrimos_fetch_into() is used to fetch a row from the result set.
ovrimos_fetch_into() fetches a row from the result set into 'result_array', which should be passed by reference. Which row is fetched is determined by the two last parameters. 'how' is one of 'Next' (default), 'Prev', 'First', 'Last', 'Absolute', corresponding to forward direction from current position, backward direction from current position, forward direction from the start, backward direction from the end and absolute position from the start (essentially equivalent to 'first' but needs 'rownumber'). Case is not significant. 'Rownumber' is optional except for absolute positioning. Returns TRUE or FALSE.
