Identical to file(), except that file_get_contents() returns the file in a string.
참고: This function is binary-safe.
작은 정보: You can use a URL as a filename with this function if the fopen wrappers have been enabled. See fopen() for more details on how to specify the filename and 부록 H for a list of supported URL protocols.
