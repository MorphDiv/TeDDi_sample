(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns the array element in the next place that's pointed by the internal array pointer, or FALSE if there are no more elements.
next() behaves like current(), with one difference. It advances the internal array pointer one place forward before returning the element. That means it returns the next array element and advances the internal array pointer by one. If advancing the internal array pointer results in going beyond the end of the element list, next() returns FALSE.
If the array contains empty elements, or elements that have a key value of 0 then this function will return FALSE for these elements as well. To properly traverse an array which may contain empty elements or elements with key values of 0 see the each() function.
