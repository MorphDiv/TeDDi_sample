The cpdf_page_init() function starts a new page with height height and width width. The page has number page number and orientation orientation. orientation can be 0 for portrait and 1 for landscape. The last optional parameter unit sets the unit for the coordinate system. The value should be the number of postscript points per unit. Since one inch is equal to 72 points, a value of 72 would set the unit to one inch. The default is also 72.
