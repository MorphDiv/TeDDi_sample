(PHP 4 = 4.0.5)
Changes the root directory of the current process to directory. Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure..
참고: It's not wise to use this function when running in a webserver environment, because it's not possible to reset the root directory to / again at the end of the request. This function will only function correct when you run PHP as command line too. (CLI)
참고: This function is not implemented on Windows platforms.
