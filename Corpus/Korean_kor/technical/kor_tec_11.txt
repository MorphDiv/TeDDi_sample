When using PHP as an Apache module, you can also change the configuration settings using directives in Apache configuration files (e.g. httpd.conf) and .htaccess files (You will need "AllowOverride Options" or "AllowOverride All" privileges)
With PHP 3.0, there are Apache directives that correspond to each configuration setting in the php3.ini name, except the name is prefixed by "php3_".
With PHP 4.0, there are several Apache directives that allow you to change the PHP configuration from within the Apache configuration files.
Sets the value of the specified directive. Can be used only with PHP_INI_ALL and PHP_INI_PERDIR type directives. To clear a previously set value use none as the value.
Used to set a Boolean configuration directive. Can be used only with PHP_INI_ALL and PHP_INI_PERDIR type directives.
Sets the value of the specified directive. This can NOT be used in .htaccess files. Any directive type set with php_admin_value can not be overridden in .htaccess files.
Used to set a Boolean configuration directive. This can NOT be used in .htaccess files. Any directive type set with php_admin_flag can not be overridden in .htaccess files.

예 4-2. Apache configuration example
참고: PHP constants do not exist outside of PHP. For example, in httpd.conf you can not use PHP constants such as E_ALL or E_NOTICE to set the error_reporting directive as they will have no meaning and will evaluate to 0. Use the associated bitmask values instead. These constants can be used in php.ini
Regardless of the interface to PHP you can change certain values at runtime of your scripts through ini_set(). The following table provides an overview at which level a directive can be set/changed.

표 4-1. Definition of PHP_INI_* constants
You can view the settings of the configuration values in the output of phpinfo(). You can also access the values of individual configuration directives using ini_get() or get_cfg_var().
