The syntax for patterns used in these functions closely resembles Perl. The expression should be enclosed in the delimiters, a forward slash (/), for example. Any character can be used for delimiter as long as it's not alphanumeric or backslash (\). If the delimiter character has to be used in the expression itself, it needs to be escaped by backslash. Since PHP 4.0.4, you can also use Perl-style (), {}, [], and matching delimiters.
The ending delimiter may be followed by various modifiers that affect the matching. See Pattern Modifiers.
PHP also supports regular expressions using a POSIX-extended syntax using the POSIX-extended regex functions..
Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package, which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright by the University of Cambridge, England. It is available at ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/.
Beginning with PHP 4.2.0 these functions are enabled by default. You can disable the pcre functions with --without-pcre-regex. Use --with-pcre-regex=DIR to specify DIR where PCRE's include and library files are located, if not using bundled library. For older versions you have to configure and compile PHP with --with-pcre-regex[=DIR] in order to use these functions.
The windows version of PHP has built in support for this extension. You do not need to load any additional extension in order to use these functions.
This extension has no configuration directives defined in php.ini.
This extension has no resource types defined.
The constants below are defined by this extension, and will only be available when the extension has either been compiled into PHP or dynamically loaded at runtime.
표 1. PREG constants

예 1. Examples of valid patterns
/ \/\w+ /
|(\d{3})-\d+|Sm
/^(?i)php[34]/
{^\s+(\s+)?$}

예 2. Examples of invalid patterns
/href='(.*)' - missing ending delimiter
/\w+\s*\w+/J - unknown modifier 'J'
