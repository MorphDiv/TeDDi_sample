(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns: An array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
mssql_fetch_row() fetches one row of data from the result associated with the specified result identifier. The row is returned as an array. Each result column is stored in an array offset, starting at offset 0.
Subsequent call to mssql_fetch_rows() would return the next row in the result set, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
See also: mssql_fetch_array(), mssql_fetch_object(), mssql_data_seek(), mssql_fetch_lengths(), and mssql_result().
