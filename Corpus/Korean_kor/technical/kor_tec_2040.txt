(PHP 3 = 3.0.5, PHP 4)
serialize() returns a string containing a byte-stream representation of value that can be stored anywhere.
This is useful for storing or passing PHP values around without losing their type and structure.
To make the serialized string into a PHP value again, use unserialize(). serialize() handles the types integer, double, string, array (multidimensional) and object (object properties will be serialized, but methods are lost).
