ingres_fetch_object() Returns an object that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
This function is similar to ingres_fetch_array(), with one difference - an object is returned, instead of an array. Indirectly, that means that you can only access the data by the field names, and not by their offsets (numbers are illegal property names).
The optional argument result_type is a constant and can take the following values: II_ASSOC, II_NUM, and II_BOTH.
Speed-wise, the function is identical to ingres_fetch_array(), and almost as quick as ingres_fetch_row() (the difference is insignificant).
