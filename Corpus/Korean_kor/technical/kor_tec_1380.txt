(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns an object with properties that correspond to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
msql_fetch_object() is similar to msql_fetch_array(), with one difference - an object is returned, instead of an array. Indirectly, that means that you can only access the data by the field names, and not by their offsets (numbers are illegal property names).
The optional second argument result_type in msql_fetch_array() is a constant and can take the following values: MSQL_ASSOC, MSQL_NUM, and MSQL_BOTH.
Speed-wise, the function is identical to msql_fetch_array(), and almost as quick as msql_fetch_row() (the difference is insignificant).
