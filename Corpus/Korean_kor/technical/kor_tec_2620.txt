These functions allow you to access FrontBase database servers. More information about FrontBase can be found at http://www.frontbase.com/.
Documentation for FrontBase can be found at http://www.frontbase.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/FrontBase.woa/wa/productsPage?currentPage=Documentation.
Frontbase support has been added to PHP 4.0.6.
You must install the FrontBase database server or at least the fbsql client libraries to use this functions. You can get FrontBase from http://www.frontbase.com/.
In order to have these functions available, you must compile PHP with fbsql support by using the --with-fbsql[=DIR] option. If you use this option without specifying the path to fbsql, PHP will search for the fbsql client libraries in the default installation location for the platform. Users who installed FrontBase in a non standard directory should always specify the path to fbsql: --with-fbsql=/path/to/fbsql. This will force PHP to use the client libraries installed by FrontBase, avoiding any conflicts.
The behaviour of these functions is affected by settings in php.ini.
