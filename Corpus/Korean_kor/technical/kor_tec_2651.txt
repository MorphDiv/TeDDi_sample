msession is an interface to a high speed session daemon which can run either locally or remotely. It is designed to provide consistent session management for a PHP web farm. More Information about msession and the session server software itself can be found at http://www.mohawksoft.com/phoenix/.
참고: This extension is not available on Windows platforms.

To enable Msession support configure PHP --with-msession[=DIR], where DIR is the Msession install directory.
