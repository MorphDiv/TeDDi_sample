pg_put_line() sends a NULL-terminated string to the PostgreSQL backend server. This is useful for example for very high-speed inserting of data into a table, initiated by starting a PostgreSQL copy-operation. That final NULL-character is added automatically. Returns TRUE if successfull, FALSE otherwise.
참고: Note the application must explicitly send the two characters "\." on a final line to indicate to the backend that it has finished sending its data.
See also pg_end_copy().
