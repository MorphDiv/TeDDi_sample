(PHP 4 = 4.1.0)
The pcntl_fork() function creates a child process that differs from the parent process only in it's PID and PPID. Please see your system's fork(2) man page for specific details as to how fork works on your system.
On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent's thread of execution, and a 0 is returned in the child's thread of execution. On failure, a -1 will be returned in the parent's context, no child process will be created, and a PHP error is raised.
