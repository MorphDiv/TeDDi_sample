(PHP 4 = 4.0.6)
array_filter() returns an array containing all the elements of input filtered according a callback function. If the input is an associative array the keys are preserved.

ì˜ˆ 1. array_filter() example
The printout of the program above will be:
Users may not change the array itself from the callback function. e.g. Add/delete an element, unset the array that array_filter() is applied to. If the array is changed, the behavior of this function is undefined.
