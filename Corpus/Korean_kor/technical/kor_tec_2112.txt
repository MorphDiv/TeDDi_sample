Returns an array of SNMP object values starting from the object_id as root and FALSE on error.
snmpwalk() function is used to read all the values from an SNMP agent specified by the hostname. Community specifies the read community for that agent. A NULL object_id is taken as the root of the SNMP objects tree and all objects under that tree are returned as an array. If object_id is specified, all the SNMP objects below that object_id are returned.
Above function call would return all the SNMP objects from the SNMP agent running on localhost. One can step through the values with a loop
