(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Returns a string formatted according to the given format string using the given timestamp or the current local time if no timestamp is given. Month and weekday names and other language dependent strings respect the current locale set with setlocale().
The following conversion specifiers are recognized in the format string:





%C - century number (the year divided by 100 and truncated to an integer, range 00 to 99)
%d - day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31)
%D - same as %m/%d/%y
%e - day of the month as a decimal number, a single digit is preceded by a space (range '1' to '31')

%H - hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23)
%I - hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12)
%j - day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366)
%m - month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12)


%p - either `am' or `pm' according to the given time value, or the corresponding strings for the current locale
%r - time in a.m. and p.m. notation



%T - current time, equal to %H:%M:%S
%u - weekday as a decimal number [1,7], with 1 representing Monday
%U - week number of the current year as a decimal number, starting with the first Sunday as the first day of the first week
%V - The ISO 8601:1988 week number of the current year as a decimal number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week that has at least 4 days in the current year, and with Monday as the first day of the week.
%W - week number of the current year as a decimal number, starting with the first Monday as the first day of the first week
%w - day of the week as a decimal, Sunday being 0


%y - year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to 99)


%% - a literal `%' character
참고: Not all conversion specifiers may be supported by your C library, in which case they will not be supported by PHP's strftime().
