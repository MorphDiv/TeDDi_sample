php_stream_gets() reads up to count -1 bytes of data from stream and copies them into the buffer buf. Reading stops after an EOF or a newline. If a newline is read, it is stored in buf as part of the returned data. A NUL terminating character is stored as the last character in the buffer.
php_stream_read() returns buf when successful or NULL otherwise.
The internal position of the stream is advanced by the number of bytes that were read, so that subsequent reads will continue reading from that point.
This function may block in the same way as php_stream_read().
