(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
Returns an ODBC connection id or 0 (FALSE) on error. This function is much like odbc_connect(), except that the connection is not really closed when the script has finished. Future requests for a connection with the same dsn, user, password combination (via odbc_connect() and odbc_pconnect()) can reuse the persistent connection.

참고: Persistent connections have no effect if PHP is used as a CGI program.
For information about the optional cursor_type parameter see the odbc_connect() function. For more information on persistent connections, refer to the PHP FAQ.
