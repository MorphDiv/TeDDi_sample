(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
Sets the processing instruction (PI) handler function for the XML parser parser. handler is a string containing the name of a function that must exist when xml_parse() is called for parser.
A processing instruction has the following format:
The function named by handler must accept three parameters: handler (int parser, string target, string data)
The first parameter, parser, is a reference to the XML parser calling the handler.
The second parameter, target, contains the PI target.
The third parameter, data, contains the PI data.
If a handler function is set to an empty string, or FALSE, the handler in question is disabled.
TRUE is returned if the handler is set up, FALSE if parser is not a parser.
There is currently no support for object/method handlers. See xml_set_object() for using the XML parser within an object.
