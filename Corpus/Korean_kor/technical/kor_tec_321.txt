This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own risk.
dbplus_find() will place a constraint on the given relation. Further calls to functions like dbplus_curr() or dbplus_next() will only return tuples matching the given constraints.
Constraints are triplets of strings containing of a domain name, a comparison operator and a comparison value. The constraints parameter array may consist of a collection of string arrays, each of which contains a domain, an operator and a value, or of a single string array containing a multiple of three elements.
The comparison operator may be one of the following strings: '==', '',' =', '',' =', '!=', '~' for a regular expression match and 'BAND' or 'BOR' for bitwise operations.
