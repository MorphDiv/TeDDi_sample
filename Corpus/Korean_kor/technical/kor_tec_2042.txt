Returns: TRUE on success, FALSE on errors
sesam_commit() commits any pending updates to the database.
Note that there is no "auto-commit" feature as in other databases, as it could lead to accidental data loss. Uncommitted data at the end of the current script (or when calling sesam_disconnect()) will be discarded by an implied sesam_rollback() call.

See also: sesam_rollback().
