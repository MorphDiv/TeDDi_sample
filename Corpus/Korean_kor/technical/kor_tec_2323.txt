This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own risk.
swfshape- setline() sets the shape's line style. width is the line's width. If width is 0, the line's style is removed (then, all other arguments are ignored). If width 0, then line's color is set to red, green, blue. Last parameter a is optional.
swfshape- setline() accepts 1, 4 or 5 arguments (not 3 or 2).
You must declare all line styles before you use them (see example).
This simple example will draw a big "!#%*@", in funny colors and gracious style.
