(PHP 4 = 4.1.0)
Opens a directory entry in a zip file for reading. The parameter zip is a valid resource handle returned by zip_open(). The parameter zip_entry is a directory entry resource returned by zip_read(). The optional parameter mode can be any of the modes specified in the documentaion for fopen().
참고: Currently, mode is ignored and is always "rb". This is due to the fact that zip support in PHP is read only access. Please see fopen() for an explanation of various modes, including "rb".
Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.
참고: Unlike fopen() and other similar functions, the return value of zip_entry_open() only indicates the result of the operation and is not needed for reading or closing the directory entry.
See also zip_entry_read() and zip_entry_close().
