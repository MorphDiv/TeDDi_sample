result_id is a valid result id returned by sesam_query().
Returns the number of rows affected by a query associated with result_id.
The sesam_affected_rows() function can only return useful values when used in combination with "immediate" SQL statements (updating operations like INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE) because SESAM does not deliver any "affected rows" information for "select type" queries. The number returned is the number of affected rows.
