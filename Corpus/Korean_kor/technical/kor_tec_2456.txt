(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
Sets the notation declaration handler function for the XML parser parser. handler is a string containing the name of a function that must exist when xml_parse() is called for parser.
A notation declaration is part of the document's DTD and has the following format:
The function named by handler must accept five parameters: handler (int parser, string notationName, string base, string systemId, string publicId)
The first parameter, parser, is a reference to the XML parser calling the handler.
This is the notation's name, as per the notation format described above.
This is the base for resolving the system identifier (systemId) of the notation declaration. Currently this parameter will always be set to an empty string.
System identifier of the external notation declaration.
Public identifier of the external notation declaration.
If a handler function is set to an empty string, or FALSE, the handler in question is disabled.
TRUE is returned if the handler is set up, FALSE if parser is not a parser.
There is currently no support for object/method handlers. See xml_set_object() for using the XML parser within an object.
