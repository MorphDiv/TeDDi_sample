The cpdf_import_jpeg() function opens an image stored in the file with the name file name. The format of the image has to be jpeg. The image is placed on the current page at position (x-coor, y-coor). The image is rotated by angle degres.
The optional parameter mode determines the unit length. If it's 0 or omitted the default unit as specified for the page is used. Otherwise the coordinates are measured in postscript points disregarding the current unit.
