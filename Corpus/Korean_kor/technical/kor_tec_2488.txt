yaz_scan_result() returns terms and associated information as received from the target in the last performed yaz_scan(). This function returns an array (0..n-1) where n is the number of terms returned. Each value is a pair where first item is term, second item is result-count. If the result is given it will be modified to hold additional information taken from the Scan Response: number (number of entries returned), stepsize (Step-size), position (position of term), status (Scan Status).
