(PHP 4 = 4.0.2)
Returns TRUE on success, or FALSE on failure.
ingres_close() closes the connection to the Ingres server that's associated with the specified link. If the link parameter isn't specified, the last opened link is used.
ingres_close() isn't usually necessary, as it won't close persistent connections and all non-persistent connections are automatically closed at the end of the script.
See also ingres_connect(), and ingres_pconnect().
