(PHP 4 = 4.3.0)
Sets the timeout value on stream, expressed in the sum of seconds and microseconds.
예 1. stream_set_timeout() Example
참고: As of PHP 4.3, this function can (potentially) work on any kind of stream. In PHP 4.3, socket based streams are still the only kind supported in the PHP core, although streams from other extensions may support this function.
This function was previously called as set_socket_timeout() and later socket_set_timeout() but this usage is deprecated.
