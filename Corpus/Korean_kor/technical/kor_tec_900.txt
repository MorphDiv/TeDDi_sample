(PHP 3 = 3.0.3, PHP 4)
Returns an associative array that corresponds to the fetched row, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
Blob columns are returned as integer blob id values for use in ifx_get_blob() unless you have used ifx_textasvarchar(1) or ifx_byteasvarchar(1), in which case blobs are returned as string values. Returns FALSE on error
result_id is a valid resultid returned by ifx_query() or ifx_prepare() (select type queries only!).
position is an optional parameter for a "fetch" operation on "scroll" cursors: "NEXT", "PREVIOUS", "CURRENT", "FIRST", "LAST" or a number. If you specify a number, an "absolute" row fetch is executed. This parameter is optional, and only valid for SCROLL cursors.
ifx_fetch_row() fetches one row of data from the result associated with the specified result identifier. The row is returned as an array. Each result column is stored in an array offset, starting at offset 0, with the column name as key.
Subsequent calls to ifx_fetch_row() would return the next row in the result set, or FALSE if there are no more rows.
