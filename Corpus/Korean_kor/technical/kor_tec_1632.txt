Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure. If successful the opened data is returned in open_data.
openssl_open() opens (decrypts) sealed_data using the private key associated with the key identifier priv_key_id and the envelope key env_key, and fills open_data with the decrypted data. The envelope key is generated when the data are sealed and can only be used by one specific private key. See openssl_seal() for more information.
