(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4)
Without the OnOff parameter, this function returns auto-commit status for connection_id. TRUE is returned if auto-commit is on, FALSE if it is off or an error occurs.
If OnOff is TRUE, auto-commit is enabled, if it is FALSE auto-commit is disabled. Returns TRUE on success, FALSE on failure.
By default, auto-commit is on for a connection. Disabling auto-commit is equivalent with starting a transaction.
