(PHP 3, PHP 4)
Sets PHP's error reporting level and returns the old level. The error reporting level is either a bitmask, or named constant. Using named constants is strongly encouraged to ensure compatibility for future versions. As error levels are added, the range of integers increases, so older integer-based error levels will not always behave as expected.
