yaz_search() 은 주어진 ID로 target에 검색을 준비한다. type은 쿼리 타입을 나타낸다.-세번째 변수로 지정된 Type-1 query (RPN)인 경우 단지 "rpn"만을 지원한다. yaz_connect() 처럼 non-blocking 이고 yaz_wait() 이 호출된 이후에 검색을 준비한다.
The RPN query is a textual represenation of the Type-1 query as defined by the Z39.50 standard. However, in the text representation as used by YAZ a prefix notation is used, that is the operater precedes the operands.
