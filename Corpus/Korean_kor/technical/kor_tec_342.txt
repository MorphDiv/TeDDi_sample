This function is EXPERIMENTAL. The behaviour of this function, the name of this function, and anything else documented about this function may change without notice in a future release of PHP. Use this function at your own risk.
dbplus_rquery() performs a local (raw) AQL query using an AQL interpreter embedded into the db++ client library. dbplus_rquery() is faster than dbplus_aql() but will work on local data only.
