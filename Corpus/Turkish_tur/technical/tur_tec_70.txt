PHP Kullanım Kılavuzu

Using PHP








When track_vars is on, it creates some associative arrays, the most important here is: $HTTP_POST_VARS.

foreach ($HTTP_POST_VARS as $var = $value) {echo "$var = $value br \n";}









To be able to use the results of your function in an expression (such as concatenating it with other strings in the example above), you need to return the value, not echo() it.




So in the example above, the echoed sentences will be on one line, because PHP ommits the newlines after the block ending.






The functions header(), set_cookie() and the session functions need to add headers to the output stream.
Headers can only be sent before all other content. function will do this if you are running PHP as an Apache module.

























The best way to check for this is to compile the command line version of PHP (also known as the CGI version) and run your script from the command line.






















Environment variables are normal global variables, so you must either declare them as global variables in your function (by using "global $DOCUMENT_ROOT;", for example) or by using the global variable array (ie, "$GLOBALS["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]".
