Variable functions



Variable functions won' t work with language constructs such as echo(), unset(), isset(), empty() and include().
Although, the construct print() is an exception and will work.
This is one of the major differences between PHP functions and language constructs.
Örnek 12-1.

?php function foo() {echo "In foo() br \n";} function bar($arg = '') {echo "In bar(); argument was '$arg'. br \n";} $func = 'foo'; $func(); $func = 'bar'; $func('test');?
See also variable variables and function_exists().
