session_register
(PHP 4 = 4.0.0)
Description


Dikkat

If you want to register a session variable inside a function, you need to make sure to make it global using global() or use the session arrays as noted below.
Dikkat
If you are using $HTTP_SESSION_VARS / $_SESSION, do not use session_register(), session_is_registered() and session_unregister().

If session_start() was not called before this function is called, an implicit call to session_start() with no parameters will be made.
You can also create a session variable by simply setting the appropriate member of the $HTTP_SESSION_VARS or $_SESSION (PHP = 4.1.0) array.
$barney = "A big purple dinosaur ."; session_register("barney"); $HTTP_SESSION_VARS["zim"] = "An invader from another planet ."; # the auto-global $_SESSION array was introduced in PHP 4.1.0 $_SESSION["spongebob"] = "He's got square pants .";
Not:
It is not currently possible to register resource variables in a session.
For example, you can not create a connection to a database and store the connection id as a session variable and expect the connection to still be valid the next time the session is restored.
PHP functions that return a resource are identified by having a return type of resource in their function definitions.

If $_SESSION (or $HTTP_SESSION_VARS for PHP 4.0.6 or less) is used, assign variable to $_SESSION. i.e. $_SESSION['var'] = 'ABC';
