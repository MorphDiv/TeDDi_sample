mt_rand
(PHP 3 = 3.0.6, PHP 4 = 4.0.0)
Description

By default, PHP uses the libc random number generator with the rand() function. mt_rand() function is a drop-in replacement for this.
It uses a random number generator with known characteristics, the Mersenne Twister, which will produce random numbers that should be suitable for seeding some kinds of cryptography (see the home pages for details) and is four times faster than what the average libc provides.
The Homepage of the Mersenne Twister can be found at http: / /www.math.keio.ac.jp / ~matumoto / emt.html, and an optimized version of the MT source is available from http: / /www.scp.syr.edu / ~marc / hawk / twister.html.


Remember to seed the random number generator before use with mt_srand().
Not:


See also mt_srand(), mt_getrandmax(), srand(), rand() and getrandmax().
