pg_connect
(PHP 3, PHP 4 = 4.0.0)
Description

pg_connect() opens a connection to a PostgreSQL database specified by connection_string.

It returns FALSE, if the connection could not be made. connection_string should be a quoted string.
Örnek 1.


If a second call is made to pg_connect() with the same connection_string arguments, no new connection will be established, but instead, the connection resource of the already opened connection will be returned.

Syntax supports multiple parameters: $conn = pg_connect ("host", "port", "options", "tty", "dbname") has been deprecated.
