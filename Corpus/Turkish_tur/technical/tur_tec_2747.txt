Database (dbm-style) abstraction layer functions





When invoking the dba_open() or dba_popen() functions, one of the following handler names must be supplied as an argument.
The actually available list of handlers is displayed by invoking phpinfo(). (To add support for any of the following handlers during the production of PHP, add the specified --with-XXXX configure switch to your PHP configure line.)
Tablo 1.






We do not support the compatibility functions built into DB2 and gdbm, because they are only compatible on the source code level, but cannot handle the original dbm format. (--with-dbm)


It still has most of the arbitrary limits of dbm (therefore it is deprecated). (--with-ndbm)

Gdbm is the GNU database manager. (--with-gdbm)


It is described as "a programmatic toolkit that provides high-performance built-in database support for both standalone and client / server applications." (--with-db2)

DB3 is Sleepycat Software' s DB3. (--with-db3)


Since it is constant, we support only reading operations. (--with-cdb)

?php # ...open database... $key = dba_firstkey ($id); while ($key != false) {if (...) {# remember the key to perform some action later $handle_later[] = $key;} $key = dba_nextkey ($id);} for ($i = 0; $i count($handle_later); $i++) dba_delete ($handle_later[$i], $id);?
