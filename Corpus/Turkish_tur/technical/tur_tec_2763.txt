FTP functions
The functions in this extension implement client access to file servers speaking the File Transfer Protocol FTP as defined in http: / /www.faqs.org / rfcs / rfc959.html.
The following constants are defined when using the FTP module:
FTP_ASCII and FTP_BINARY.
In order to use FTP functions with your PHP configuration, you should add the --enable-ftp option when installing PHP 4, and --with-ftp when using PHP 3.
