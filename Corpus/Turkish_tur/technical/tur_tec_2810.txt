PostgreSQL functions
Uyarý
Use of PostgreSQL module with PHP 4.0.6 is not recommended due to a bug in notice message handling.
Uyarý
PostgreSQL function names will be changed in 4.2.0 release to confirm current coding standard.
Most of new names will have additional under score( s), e.g. pg_lo_open().

Older names may be used in 4.2.0 and a few releases from 4.2.0, but they may be deleted in the future.
CVS version has new function names.

Obsolete pg_connect() / pg_pconnect() syntax will be depreciated to support async connect feature in the future.
Please use connection string for pg_connect() and pg_pconnect().




To use PostgreSQL support, you need PostgreSQL 6.5 or later.
PostgreSQL 7.0 or later to enable all PostgreSQL module feature.

The current version and more information about PostgreSQL is available at www.postgresql.org.
In order to enable PostgreSQL support, "--with-pgsql[=DIR]" is required when you compile PHP.
If shared object module is available, PostgreSQL module may be loaded using extension directive in php.ini or dl() If shared object module is available, PostgreSQL module may be loaded using extension directive in php.ini or dl() function.
Supported ini directives are described in php.ini-dist file which comes with source distribution.



It is also important that you use newer libpq than PostgreSQL Server to be connected.






Tablo 1.



















Environmental variable affects PostgreSQL server / client behavior.
For example, PostgreSQL module will lookup PGHOST environment variable when hostname is omitted in connection string.


From PostgreSQL 7.1.0, text data type has 1GB as its max size.
Older PostgreSQL' s text data type is limited by block size. (Default 8KB.
Max 32KB defined at compile time)

A transaction block starts with a SQL statement begin and if the transaction was valid ends with commit or end.
If the transaction fails the transaction should be closed with rollback or abort.

?php $database = pg_connect ("dbname=jacarta"); pg_exec ($database, "begin"); $oid = pg_locreate ($database); echo ("$oid\n"); $handle = pg_loopen ($database, $oid, "w"); echo ("$handle\n"); pg_lowrite ($handle, "large object data"); pg_loclose ($handle); pg_exec ($database, "commit");?
