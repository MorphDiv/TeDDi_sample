ImageTTFText
(PHP 3, PHP 4 = 4.0.0)
Description
ImageTTFText() draws the string text in the image identified by im, starting at coordinates x, y (top left is 0, 0), at an angle of angle in color col, using the TrueType font file identified by fontfile.
Depending on which version of the GD library that PHP is using, when fontfile does not begin with a leading '/', '.ttf 'will be appended to the filename and the the library will attempt to search for that filename along a library-defined font path.

This is different from the ImageString(), where x, y define the upper-right corner of the first character.
Angle is in degrees, with 0 degrees being left-to-right reading text (3 o'clock direction), and higher values representing a counter-clockwise rotation. (i.e., a value of 90 would result in bottom-to-top reading text).
Fontfile is the path to the TrueType font you wish to use.
Text is the text string which may include UTF-8 character sequences (of the form: #123;) to access characters in a font beyond the first 255.


ImageTTFText() returns an array with 8 elements representing four points making the bounding box of the text.
