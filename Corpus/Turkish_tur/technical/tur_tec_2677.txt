Remember basic arithmetic from school?
These work just like those.
Tablo 10-1.

Example
Name
Result
$a + $b
Addition
Sum of $a and $b.
$a - $b
Subtraction
Difference of $a and $b.
$a * $b
Multiplication
Product of $a and $b.
$a / $b
Division
Quotient of $a and $b.
$a% $b
Modulus
Remainder of $a divided by $b.
The division operator ("/") returns an integer value (the result of an integer division) if the two operands are integers (or strings that get converted to integers) and the quotient is an integer.
If either operand is a floating-point value, or the operation results in a non-integer value, a floating-point value is returned.
