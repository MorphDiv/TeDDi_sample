session_cache_limiter

Description


The cache limiter controls the cache control HTTP headers sent to the client.
These headers determine the rules by which the page content may be cached.
Setting the cache limiter to nocache, for example, would disallow any client-side caching.
A value of public, however, would permit caching.
It can also be set to private, which is slightly more restrictive than public.
In private mode, Expire header sent to the client, may cause confusion for some browser including Mozilla.
You can avoid this problem with private_no_expire mode.
Expire header is never sent to the client in this mode.
