Predefined variables



For a listing of these variables, please see the section Predefined variables.
Uyarý
In PHP 4.2.0 and later, the default set of predefined variables which are available in the global scope has changed.
Individual input and server variables are by default no longer placed directly into the global scope; rather, they are placed into the following superglobal arrays.
You can still force the old behaviour by setting register_globals to 'On' in your php.ini file.
For more information and background on this change, please see the PHP 4.1.0 Release Announcement.
From version 4.1.0 onward, PHP provides a set of predefined arrays containing variables from the web server (if applicable), the environment, and user input.

For this reason, they are often known as 'autoglobals' or 'superglobals'. (There is no mechanism in PHP for user-defined superglobals.) The superglobals are listed below; however, for a listing of their contents and further discussion on PHP predefined variables and their natures, please see the section Predefined variables.


The keys of this array are the names of the global variables.














Note: when running on the command line, this will not include the argv and argc entries; these are present in the $_SERVER array.
