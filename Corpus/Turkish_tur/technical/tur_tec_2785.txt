Mcrypt Encryption Functions




Örnek 1.

?php $key = "this is a very secret key"; $input = "Let us meet at 9 o'clock at the secret place ."; $encrypted_data = mcrypt_ecb (MCRYPT_3DES, $key, $input, MCRYPT_ENCRYPT);?
If you linked against libmcrypt 2.4.x, these functions are still available, but it is recommended that you use the advanced functions.
Örnek 2.
Encrypt an input value with TripleDES under 2.4.x in ECB mode
?php $key = "this is a very secret key"; $input = "Let us meet at 9 o'clock at the secret place ."; $td = mcrypt_module_open (MCRYPT_TripleDES, "", MCRYPT_MODE_ECB, ""); $iv = mcrypt_create_iv (mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size ($td), MCRYPT_RAND); mcrypt_generic_init ($td, $key, $iv); $encrypted_data = mcrypt_generic ($td, $input); mcrypt_generic_end ($td);?
Requirements

If you linked against libmcrypt 2.4.x, the following additional block algorithms are supported:


With libmcrypt 2.4.x another cipher mode is also available; nOFB.
Installation

You need to compile PHP with the --with-mcrypt parameter to enable this extension.

Runtime Configuration
Resource types
This extension does not define any resource types.
Predefined constants

If linked against libmcrypt-2.4.x mcrypt can also operate in the block cipher mode nOFB and in STREAM mode.













With the mcrypt-2.4.x API these constants also work, but it is possible to specify the name of the cipher as a string with a call to mcrypt_module_open().
