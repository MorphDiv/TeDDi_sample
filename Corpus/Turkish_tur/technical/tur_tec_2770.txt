ICAP Functions [deprecated]
To get these functions to work, you have to compile PHP with --with-icap.
That requires the icap library to be installed, which is not longer supported and available.
Not:
Icap will be removed in near future.
Neither this module, nor those versions of icap library are supported any longer.
If you want to use calendar capabilities in php, use mcal instead.
