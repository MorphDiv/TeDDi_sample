XLII.
IMAP, POP3 and NNTP functions
To get these functions to work, you have to compile PHP with --with-imap.
That requires the c-client library to be installed.

Then copy c-client / c-client.a to / usr / local / lib / libc-client.a or some other directory on your link path and copy c-client / rfc822.h, mail.h and linkage.h to / usr / local / include or some other directory in your include path.
Note that these functions are not limited to the IMAP protocol, despite their name.
