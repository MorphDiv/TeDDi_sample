PHP and COM


























No, unfortunatelly there is no such tool available for PHP.









You only have to pass the ip of the remote machine as second parameter to the COM constructor.

I 'm having problems when trying to invoke a method of a COM object wich exposes more than one interface.










Thus if an error occours no rollback is initiated.
