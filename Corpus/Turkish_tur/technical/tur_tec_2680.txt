Operator Precedence
The precedence of an operator specifies how "tightly" it binds two expressions together.
For example, in the expression 1 + 5 * 3, the answer is 16 and not 18 because the multiplication ("*") operator has a higher precedence than the addition ("+") operator.
Parentheses may be used to force precedence, if necessary.
For instance: (1 + 5) * 3 evaluates to 18.
The following table lists the precedence of operators with the lowest-precedence operators listed first.
Tablo 10-6.
