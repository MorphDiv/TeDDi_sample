fgetcsv
(PHP 3 = 3.0.8, PHP 4 = 4.0.0)
Description

The field delimiter is a comma, unless you specify another delimiter with the optional third parameter.
Fp must be a valid file pointer to a file successfully opened by fopen(), popen(), or fsockopen()
Length must be greater than the longest line to be found in the CSV file (allowing for trailing line-end characters).

N.B.
A blank line in a CSV file will be returned as an array comprising a single NULL field, and will not be treated as an error.
Örnek 1. fgetcsv() example - Read and print entire contents of a CSV file
$row = 1; $fp = fopen ("test.csv" ,"r"); while ($data = fgetcsv ($fp, 1000, ",")) {$num = count ($data); print" p $num fields in line $row: br "; $row++; for ($c=0; $c $num; $c++) {print $data[$c]." br ";}} fclose ($fp);
