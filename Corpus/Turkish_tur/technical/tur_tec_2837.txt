Zlib Compression Functions
This module uses the functions of zlib by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler to transparently read and write gzip (.gz) compressed files.

This module contains versions of most of the filesystem functions which work with gzip-compressed files (and uncompressed files, too, but not with sockets).
Not:
Version 4.0.4 introduces a fopen-wrapper for .gz-files, so that you can use a special 'zlib:' URL to access compressed files transparently using the normal f*() file access functions if you prepend the filename or path with a 'zlib: 'prefix when calling fopen().



Small code example
Opens a temporary file and writes a test string to it, then it prints out the content of this file twice.
