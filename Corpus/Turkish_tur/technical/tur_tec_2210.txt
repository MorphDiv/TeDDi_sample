socket_set_blocking
(PHP 4 = 4.0.0)
Description
If mode is FALSE, the given socket descriptor will be switched to non-blocking mode, and if TRUE, it will be switched to blocking mode.
This affects calls like fgets() that read from the socket.
In non-blocking mode an fgets() call will always return right away while in blocking mode it will wait for data to become available on the socket.
This function was previously called as set_socket_blocking() but this usage is deprecated.
