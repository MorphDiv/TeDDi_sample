Books about PHP


To the best of our knowledge, the first book dedicated to PHP was 'php - dynamische webauftritte professionell realisieren' - a German book published in 1999, authored by Egon Schmid, Christian Cartus and Richard Blume.


While these two books were the first of their kind - they were followed by a large number of books from a host of authors and publishers.
