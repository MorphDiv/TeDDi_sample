When a correct signature is found a constant will be returned otherwise the return value is FALSE The return value is the same value that GetImageSize() returns in index 2 but this function is much faster.

1 = IMAGETYPE_GIF, 2 = IMAGETYPE_JPG, 3 = IMAGETYPE_PNG, 4 = IMAGETYPE_SWF, 5 = IMAGETYPE_PSD, 6 = IMAGETYPE_BMP, 7 = IMAGETYPE_TIFF_II (intel byte order), 8 = IMAGETYPE_TIFF_MM (motorola byte order), 9 = IMAGETYPE_JPC, 10 = IMAGETYPE_JP2, 11 = IMAGETYPE_JPX.
