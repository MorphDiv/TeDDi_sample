Database issues









































Select the table to link, press ok, and presto!



You can construct your tables in access and export them to MySQL, then link them back in.

When creating tables in access, you must have a primary key defined in order to have write access to the table in access.


Go to tools add-ins linked table manager, cruise to your ODBC DSN, and select the table to re-link from there. you can also move your dsn source around there, just hit the always prompt for new location checkbox before pressing ok.
