CURL, Client URL Library Functions






There should be a file named "libcurl.a" located in the "lib "directory.

Once you 've compiled PHP with CURL support, you can begin using the curl functions.
The basic idea behind the CURL functions is that you initialize a CURL session using the curl_init(), then you can set all your options for the transfer via the curl_exec() and then you finish off your session using the curl_close().
Here is an example that uses the CURL functions to fetch the PHP homepage into a file:

?php $ch = curl_init ("http: / /www.php.net / "); $fp = fopen ("php_homepage.txt", "w"); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_FILE, $fp); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0); curl_exec ($ch); curl_close ($ch); fclose ($fp);?
