Informix functions








The configure script will autodetect the libraries and include directories, if you run "configure --with_informix=yes".
You can override this detection by specifying "IFX_LIBDIR", "IFX_LIBS" and "IFX_INCDIR "in the environment.
The configure script will also try to detect your Informix server version.
It will set the "HAVE_IFX_IUS" conditional compilation variable if your Informix version = 9.00.
Runtime considerations:





The Informix shared libraries should also be available to the loader (check LD_LINBRARY_PATH or ld.so.conf / ldconfig).
