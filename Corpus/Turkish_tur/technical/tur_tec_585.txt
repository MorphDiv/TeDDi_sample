fopen
(PHP 3, PHP 4 = 4.0.0)
Description
If filename begins with "http: / /" (not case sensitive), an HTTP 1.0 connection is opened to the specified server, the page is requested using the HTTP GET method, and a file pointer is returned to the beginning of the body of the response.
A 'Host:' header is sent with the request in order to handle name-based virtual hosts.
As of PHP 4.3.0 (not yet released), if you have compiled in support for OpenSSL, you may use "https: / / "to open an HTTP connection over SSL.
Note that the file pointer allows you to retrieve only the body of the response; to retrieve the HTTP response header you need to be using PHP 4.0.5 or later; The headers will be stored in the $http_response_header variable.
As of PHP 4.3.0 (not yet released), the header information can be retrieved using the fgetwrapperdata().
HTTP connections are read-only; you cannot write data or copy files to an HTTP resource.
Versions prior to PHP 4.0.5 do not handle HTTP redirects.
Because of this, directories must include trailing slashes.
If filename begins with "ftp: / /" (not case sensitive), an ftp connection to the specified server is opened and a pointer to the requested file is returned.
If the server does not support passive mode ftp, this will fail.
You can open files for either reading or writing via ftp (but not both simultaneously).
If filename is one of "php: / /stdin", "php: / /stdout", or "php: / /stderr", the corresponding stdio stream will be opened. (This was introduced in PHP 3.0.13; in earlier versions, a filename such as" / dev / stdin "or" / dev / fd / 0 "must be used to access the stdio streams.)
If filename begins with anything else, the file will be opened from the filesystem, and a file pointer to the file opened is returned.

mode may be any of the following:










Not:
The mode The mode may contain the letter 'b'.




You can use the optional third parameter and set it to "1", if you want to search for the file in the include_path, too.
Örnek 1. fopen() example
$fp = fopen ("/ home / rasmus / file.txt", "r"); $fp = fopen (" / home / rasmus / file.gif", "wb"); $fp = fopen ("http: / /www.php.net /", "r"); $fp = fopen ("ftp: / /user:password@example.com / ", "w");
