Mail functions
The mail() function allows you to send mail
Mail Configuration Directives
DNS name or IP address of the SMTP server PHP under Windows should use for mail sent with the mail() function.

Where the sendmail program can be found, usually / usr / sbin / sendmail or / usr / lib / sendmail configure does an honest attempt of locating this one for you and set a default, but if it fails, you can set it here.

For example, Qmail users can normally set it to / var / qmail / bin / sendmail.
