# special_characters:	Many diacritics and special characters are used by Harrington (1946), but unfortunately there is no explanation of what these represent. The phonetics section in Harrington (1928) Vocabulary of the Kiowa language, might help to understand the diacritics. However, note that the text "The Udder-angry Travelers-off" is also given as an appendix in Harrington (1928) though with an orthography differing from the Harrington (1946) orthography, suggesting that the orthography was further adapted towards the 1946 version of the text. We therefore use the unicode symbols visually closest to Harrington's orthography without further interpretation.
