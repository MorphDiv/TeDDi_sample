README LangInfo_100.csv

This file contains information on the languages of the WALS 100 language sample from both WALS and Glottolog 3.3. It was created by downloading the following files:

- languages_and_dialects_geo.csv (Version 3.3, at https://glottolog.org/meta/downloads; accessed on 10/10/2018)
- glottolog_languoid.csv (Version 3.3, at https://glottolog.org/meta/downloads; accessed on 10/10/2018)   
- Wals_languages.csv (WALS 2014, at https://wals.info/languoid by choosing the "tab" option for downloads; accessed on accessed on 10/10/2018)

Wals_languages.csv was amended by removing the comma in "(West Papuan, Indonesia)" in order to enable saving it as a csv file. Also, four deprecated glottocodes were replaced: 

old glottocode -> new glottocode
huam1250 -> hmon1264
kew1250 -> west2599
slav1253 -> nort2942
tuka1247 -> tuka1249

The R code used to process and merge the three data files is given in langInfo_100_merge.R 

Note that WALS gives two ISO-639-3 codes for overall 6 languages in the 100 language sample. In cases where the difference is due to the existence of two varieties according to Glottolog, the first iso code represents both:

bhq, khc -> Tukang Besi South, Tukang Besi North -> bhq 
kew, kjs -> West Kewa, East Kewa -> kew
scs, xsl -> North Slavey, South Slavey -> scs

In cases where one of the ISO codes is considered a "Bookkeeping" languoid (see https://glottolog.org/glottolog/glottologinformation for a definition) by Glottolog, the other code is given:

cqd, hnj -> hnj

In cases where one of the ISO codes is not registered with Glottolog, the other is given:

ram, xra -> ram
jac, jai -> jac

This leaves the number of languages defined by unique ISO-639-3 and glottocodes at 100.
