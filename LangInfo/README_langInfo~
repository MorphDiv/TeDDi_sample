Column: iso_639_3

The file was created by starting with ISO-639-3 codes (column iso_639_3) as given in WALS (https://wals.info/, accessed 10/04/2018). In some cases, there are two ISO-639-3 codes given per language in WALS. In these cases, we selected one ISO code by further consulting Glottolog 3.3 (https://glottolog.org/, accessed 10/04/2018). 

In cases where the difference is due to the existence of two varieties according to Glottolog, we simply choose the first iso code to represent both:

bhq, khc -> Tukang Besi South, Tukang Besi North -> bhq 
kew, kjs -> West Kewa, East Kewa -> kew
scs, xsl -> North Slavey, South Slavey -> scs

In cases where one of the ISO codes is considered a "Bookkeeping" languoid (see https://glottolog.org/glottolog/glottologinformation for a definition) by Glottolog, we choose the other:

cqd, hnj -> hnj

In cases where one of the ISO codes is not registered with Glottolog, we choose the other:

ram, xra -> ram
jac, jai -> jac
