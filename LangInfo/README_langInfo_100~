README LangInfo.csv

This file was created by downloading the WALS languoid information in tab format (https://wals.info/languoid, accessed 10/10/2018). The file was amended by removing the comma in "(West Papuan, Indonesia)" in order to enable saving it as a csv file. Also, four deprecated glottocodes were replaced: 

old glottocode -> new glottocode
huam1250 -> hmon1264
kew1250 -> west2599
slav1253 -> nort2942
tuka1247 -> tuka1249


In cases where the difference is due to the existence of two varieties according to Glottolog, we simply choose the first iso code to represent both:

bhq, khc -> Tukang Besi South, Tukang Besi North -> bhq 
kew, kjs -> West Kewa, East Kewa -> kew
scs, xsl -> North Slavey, South Slavey -> scs

In cases where one of the ISO codes is considered a "Bookkeeping" languoid (see https://glottolog.org/glottolog/glottologinformation for a definition) by Glottolog, we choose the other:

cqd, hnj -> hnj

In cases where one of the ISO codes is not registered with Glottolog, we choose the other:

ram, xra -> ram
jac, jai -> jac
