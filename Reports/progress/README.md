# Progress report

The [progress.py](progress.py) is a Python script that loops through the corpus files and reports the number of texts, genres covered, unique characters per language. Unlike [file_counts](../file_counts) and [line_counts](../line_counts) this report returns zero values for languages that are not covered yet. The output format is a `CSV` file of the following structure:  `language,number_texts,number_genres,number_characters`. The `CSV` file will be written to the same directory as the script.
