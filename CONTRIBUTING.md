# How to contribute

## Overview

The 100 LC repository is a collaborative effort to collect, curate, and analyze corpora.

Here you will find reports on our practices for transcribing and annotating texts:

* [Tutorial: Transcription and Annotation of Texts](https://www.overleaf.com/2126693322drbnvwzzvfsv)
* [Adding PBC bibles and UDHR texts](https://www.overleaf.com/9246389869rxwwtxhjxfcm)

Each file must contain a correctly formatted header. An example is given in the [header_template.tsv](https://github.com/uzling/100LC/blob/master/header_template.tsv) file.

A description of the sampling algorithm is on Overleaf:

* [Report on the project discussion in November--December 2018](https://www.overleaf.com/2181948136htbsjqnypshb)

And the [100LC/Crawlers](https://github.com/uzling/100LC/tree/master/Crawlers) directory contains the web crawlers.

## Workflow

We use GitHub to maintain the corpus and code. You can read more about what GitHub is here:

* [What Is GitHub? A Beginnerâ€™s Introduction to GitHub](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/)

If you haven't used GitHub before, you will need to create a free account here:

and you can start working through the tutorials here:

* https://lab.github.com/

Please use the GitHub workflow, described in detail here:

When working with this repository, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/uzling/100LC/issues) and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/uzling/100LC/pulls) for your branches, when adding or updating data or code.

We follow standard practice in collaborative development on GitHub, which is to follow the fork and pull request model:

* https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/

There are a number of good GUIs for working with GitHub. For example:

* https://desktop.github.com/
