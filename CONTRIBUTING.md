# How to contribute

## Overview

The 100 LC repository is a collaborative effort to collect, curate, and analyze corpora.

Here you will find reports on our practices for transcribing and annotating texts:

* [Tutorial: Transcription and Annotation of Texts](https://www.overleaf.com/2126693322drbnvwzzvfsv)
* [Adding PBC bibles and UDHR texts](https://www.overleaf.com/9246389869rxwwtxhjxfcm)

On SwitchDrive there is an example metadata header:

* https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/a7qzQoGGlIHQwGI

but it is incorrectly formatted (i.e. has multiple tabs), so it has been fixed and put in this directory as [header_template.tsv](https://github.com/uzling/100LC/blob/master/header_template.tsv) for use and reference.

A description of the sampling algorithm is on Overleaf:

* [Report on the project discussion in November--December 2018](https://www.overleaf.com/2181948136htbsjqnypshb)

And the [100LC/Crawlers](https://github.com/uzling/100LC/tree/master/Crawlers) directory contains the web crawlers.
