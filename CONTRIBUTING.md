# How to contribute

## Overview

The 100 LC repository is a collaborative effort to collect, curate, and analyze corpora.

Here you will find reports on our practices for transcribing and annotating texts:

* [Tutorial: Transcription and Annotation of Texts](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5cb846b20e7ba737465f8223)
* [Adding PBC bibles and UDHR texts](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5c5ad23e2600fe61259dfd25)

On SwitchDrive there is an example metadata header:

* https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/a7qzQoGGlIHQwGI

but it is incorrectly formatted (i.e. has multiple tabs), so it has been fixed and put in this directory as [header_template.tsv](https://github.com/uzling/100LC/blob/master/header_template.tsv) for use and reference.

A description of the sampling algorithm is on Overleaf:

* [Report on the project discussion in November--December 2018](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5c372715fbc85849bdc7dc0d)

And the [100LC/Crawlers](https://github.com/uzling/100LC/tree/master/Crawlers) directory contains the web crawlers.

## Workflow

When working with this GitHub repository, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/uzling/100LC/issues) and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/uzling/100LC/pulls) when adding or updating data or code.

Standard practice in collaborative development on GitHub is to follow the fork and pull request model. See these documents for more information:
